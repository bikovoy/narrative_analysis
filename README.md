# Final assignment

This is a basic template. Notice that we have an Rproject for you to help with your file references, and two folders, one for data and one for graphics. 

## What to include
A successful assignment contains all the data needed to replicate the graphics/analysis, the exact code used to create the everything (it should call all relevant packages/libraries), and presend the graphics in a nice **markdown** document.
