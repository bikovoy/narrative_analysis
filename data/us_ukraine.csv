Joe Biden,"February 23, 2022",Statement on the Nord Stream 2 Natural Gas Pipeline Between Russia and Germany,"Since Russia began deploying troops to the Ukrainian border, the United States has worked closely with our allies and partners to deliver a strong, unified response. As I said when I met with Chancellor Scholz earlier this month, Germany has been a leader in that effort, and we have closely coordinated our efforts to stop the Nord Stream 2 pipeline if Russia further invaded Ukraine.
Yesterday, after further close consultations between our two governments, Germany announced that it would halt certification of the pipeline. Today I have directed my administration to impose sanctions on Nord Stream 2 AG and its corporate officers. These steps are another piece of our initial tranche of sanctions in response to Russia's actions in Ukraine. As I have made clear, we will not hesitate to take further steps if Russia continues to escalate.
Through his actions, President Putin has provided the world with an overwhelming incentive to move away from Russian gas and to other forms of energy. I want to thank Chancellor Scholz for his close partnership and continued dedication to holding Russia accountable for its actions.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-the-nord-stream-2-natural-gas-pipeline-between-russia-and-germany
Joe Biden,"February 23, 2022",Joint Statement by President Biden and Prime Minister Justin P.J. Trudeau of Canada on the One-Year Anniversary of the Roadmap for a Renewed U.S.-Canada Partnership,"One year ago, the United States and Canada reaffirmed the special nature of our relationship, and our commitment to working closely together in the interests of the collective security and prosperity of our citizens based on the principles of democracy, diversity, and equity. The Roadmap for a Renewed U.S.-Canada Partnership guides our work, and lays out an ambitious framework to build a greener, more prosperous future; grow our economies and strengthen the middle class; combat the global COVID-19 pandemic; create safer, more equitable communities; and stand together in the face of threats to democracy. Defending democracy is at the heart of our commitment to stand with Ukraine in the face of Russia's unprovoked invasion. We have made progress over the past year and laid the foundation to deepen our cooperation on climate change, on supporting the global pandemic response efforts, on enhancing cooperation on the Arctic, and on building the economies of the future, including through work to strengthen bilateral supply chains and cooperation on critical minerals. Much work remains to be done. Our countries are both stronger when we work together towards our shared objectives. We look forward to building on the enduring partnership between our two great nations in the years ahead.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/joint-statement-president-biden-and-prime-minister-justin-pj-trudeau-canada-the-one-year
Joe Biden,"February 23, 2022",Statement on Russia's Attack on Ukraine,"The prayers of the entire world are with the people of Ukraine tonight as they suffer an unprovoked and unjustified attack by Russian military forces. President Putin has chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering. Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and the United States and its allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way. The world will hold Russia accountable.
I will be monitoring the situation from the White House this evening and will continue to get regular updates from my national security team. Tomorrow I will meet with my G-7 counterparts in the morning and then speak to the American people to announce the further consequences the United States and our allies and partners will impose on Russia for this needless act of aggression against Ukraine and global peace and security. We will also coordinate with our NATO allies to ensure a strong, united response that deters any aggression against the alliance. Tonight Jill and I are praying for the brave and proud people of Ukraine.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-russias-attack-ukraine
Joe Biden,"February 24, 2022",Statement on the President's Telephone Conversation With President Volodymyr Zelenskiy of Ukraine,"President Zelenskyy reached out to me tonight and we just finished speaking. I condemned this unprovoked and unjustified attack by Russian military forces. I briefed him on the steps we are taking to rally international condemnation, including tonight at the United Nations Security Council. He asked me to call on the leaders of the world to speak out clearly against President Putin's flagrant aggression, and to stand with the people of Ukraine. Tomorrow I will be meeting with the leaders of the G-7, and the United States and our allies and partners will be imposing severe sanctions on Russia. We will continue to provide support and assistance to Ukraine and the Ukrainian people.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-the-presidents-telephone-conversation-with-president-volodymyr-zelenskiy-ukraine
Joe Biden,"February 25, 2022",Statement on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Summit and Telephone Conversation With President Volodymyr Zelenskiy of Ukraine,"Today I met with fellow leaders from our NATO allies to discuss our shared commitment to collective defense and transatlantic security. As President Putin threatens the very foundations of international peace and security, NATO is once again demonstrating that it stands for freedom and democracy.
As I said yesterday, the United States will defend every inch of NATO territory. Our commitment to article 5 is ironclad. I have ordered the deployment of additional forces to augment our capabilities in Europe to support our NATO allies. And I strongly welcome the decision to activate NATO's defensive plans and elements of the NATO Response Force to strengthen our collective posture, as well as the commitments by our allies to deploy additional land and air forces to the eastern flank and maritime forces from the High North to the Mediterranean.
We were joined today by our close partners Sweden, Finland, and the European Union. President Putin has failed in his goal of dividing the West. NATO is as united and resolute as it's ever been, and NATO will maintain its open door to those European states who share our values and who one day may seek to join our alliance. As we navigate this crisis, we pledged to work even more closely together in our defense of freedom and the democratic values that imbue our alliance with purpose and power.
Immediately after the NATO summit, I spoke with President Zelenskyy of Ukraine. I commended the brave actions of the Ukrainian people who were fighting to defend their country. I also conveyed ongoing economic, humanitarian, and security support being provided by the United States as well as our continued efforts to rally other countries to provide similar assistance.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-the-north-atlantic-treaty-organization-summit-and-telephone-conversation-with
Joe Biden,"February 25, 2022",Joint Statement by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Heads of State and Government on Russia's Attack on Ukraine,"We have met today to discuss the gravest threat to Euro-Atlantic security in decades. We condemn in the strongest possible terms Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, enabled by Belarus. We call on Russia to immediately cease its military assault, to withdraw all its forces from Ukraine and to turn back from the path of aggression it has chosen. This long-planned attack on Ukraine, an independent, peaceful and democratic country, is brutal and wholly unprovoked and unjustified. We deplore the tragic loss of life, enormous human suffering and destruction caused by Russia's actions. Peace on the European continent has been fundamentally shattered. The world will hold Russia, as well as Belarus, accountable for their actions. We call on all states to condemn this unconscionable attack unreservedly. No one should be fooled by the Russian government's barrage of lies.
Russia bears full responsibility for this conflict. It has rejected the path of diplomacy and dialogue repeatedly offered to it by NATO and Allies. It has fundamentally violated international law, including the UN Charter. Russia's actions are also a flagrant rejection of the principles enshrined in the NATO-Russia Founding Act: it is Russia that has walked away from its commitments under the Act. President Putin's decision to attack Ukraine is a terrible strategic mistake, for which Russia will pay a severe price, both economically and politically, for years to come. Massive and unprecedented sanctions have already been imposed on Russia. NATO will continue to coordinate closely with relevant stakeholders and other international organisations including the EU. At the invitation of the Secretary General, we were joined today by Finland, Sweden and the European Union.
We stand in full solidarity with the democratically elected president, parliament and government of Ukraine and with the brave people of Ukraine who are now defending their homeland. Our thoughts are with all those killed, injured and displaced by Russia's aggression, and with their families. NATO remains committed to all the foundational principles underpinning European security, including that each nation has the right to choose its own security arrangements. We will continue to provide political and practical support to Ukraine as it continues to defend itself and call on others to do the same. We reaffirm our unwavering support for the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognised borders, including its territorial waters. This principled position will never change.
In light of Russia's actions, we will draw all the necessary consequences for NATO's deterrence and defence posture. Allies have held consultations under Article 4 of the Washington Treaty. We will continue to take all measures and decisions required to ensure the security and defence of all Allies. We have deployed defensive land and air forces in the eastern part of the Alliance, and maritime assets across the NATO area. We have activated NATO's defence plans to prepare ourselves to respond to a range of contingencies and secure Alliance territory, including by drawing on our response forces. We are now making significant additional defensive deployments of forces to the eastern part of the Alliance. We will make all deployments necessary to ensure strong and credible deterrence and defence across the Alliance, now and in the future. Our measures are and remain preventive, proportionate and non-escalatory.
Our commitment to Article 5 of the Washington Treaty is iron-clad. We stand united to protect and defend all Allies. Freedom will always win over oppression.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/joint-statement-the-north-atlantic-treaty-organization-heads-state-and-government-russias
Joe Biden,"February 26, 2022",Joint Statement on Further Restrictive Economic Measures,"We, the leaders of the European Commission, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States condemn Putin's war of choice and attacks on the sovereign nation and people of Ukraine. We stand with the Ukrainian government and the Ukrainian people in their heroic efforts to resist Russia's invasion. Russia's war represents an assault on fundamental international rules and norms that have prevailed since the Second World War, which we are committed to defending. We will hold Russia to account and collectively ensure that this war is a strategic failure for Putin.
This past week, alongside our diplomatic efforts and collective work to defend our own borders and to assist the Ukrainian government and people in their fight, we, as well as our other allies and partners around the world, imposed severe measures on key Russian institutions and banks, and on the architects of this war, including Russian President Vladimir Putin.
As Russian forces unleash their assault on Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities, we are resolved to continue imposing costs on Russia that will further isolate Russia from the international financial system and our economies. We will implement these measures within the coming days.
Specifically, we commit to undertake the following measures:
First, we commit to ensuring that selected Russian banks are removed from the SWIFT messaging system. This will ensure that these banks are disconnected from the international financial system and harm their ability to operate globally.
Second, we commit to imposing restrictive measures that will prevent the Russian Central Bank from deploying its international reserves in ways that undermine the impact of our sanctions.
Third, we commit to acting against the people and entities who facilitate the war in Ukraine and the harmful activities of the Russian government. Specifically, we commit to taking measures to limit the sale of citizenship—so called golden passports—that let wealthy Russians connected to the Russian government become citizens of our countries and gain access to our financial systems.
Fourth, we commit to launching this coming week a transatlantic task force that will ensure the effective implementation of our financial sanctions by identifying and freezing the assets of sanctioned individuals and companies that exist within our jurisdictions. As a part of this effort we are committed to employing sanctions and other financial and enforcement measures on additional Russian officials and elites close to the Russian government, as well as their families, and their enablers to identify and freeze the assets they hold in our jurisdictions. We will also engage other governments and work to detect and disrupt the movement of ill-gotten gains, and to deny these individuals the ability to hide their assets in jurisdictions across the world.
Finally, we will step up or coordination against disinformation and other forms of hybrid warfare.
We stand with the Ukrainian people in this dark hour. Even beyond the measures we are announcing today, we are prepared to take further measures to hold Russia to account for its attack on Ukraine.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/joint-statement-further-restrictive-economic-measures
Joe Biden,"March 02, 2022",Statement on the United Nations General Assembly Vote To Condemn Russia's Aggression Against Ukraine,"Today, for the first time in 40 years, the United Nations Security Council convened an emergency special session of the General Assembly under the Uniting for Peace mechanism in response to Russia's unprovoked, unjustified, and unconscionable war on Ukraine. This extraordinary move by the United Nations demonstrates the extent of global outrage at Russia's horrific assault on a sovereign neighbor and showcased unprecedented global unity.
An overwhelming majority of nations around the world condemn Putin's war. An overwhelming majority of nations recognize that Putin is not only attacking Ukraine, he is attacking the very foundations of global peace and security and everything the United Nations stands for. And an overwhelming majority of the world recognizes that if we do not stand up to Putin's Russia, it will only inflict further chaos and aggression on the world. Russia stood isolated, with the support of only four brutal, authoritarian states.
I commend the member states of the United Nations for holding this historic session. Today's vote lays bare Putin's isolation. It also holds Belarus accountable for its unacceptable involvement in this war.
The world is rejecting Russia's lies. We can all see what is happening in Ukraine with our own eyes. Russia is responsible for the devastating abuses of human rights and the international humanitarian crisis that we are watching unfold in Ukraine in real time. There is no room for excuses or equivocation. Russia is to blame.
The United Nations was founded to ""save succeeding generations from the scourge of war."" As Secretary-General António Guterres said, enough is enough. Together, we must—and we will—hold Russia accountable for its actions. We will demonstrate that freedom always triumphs over tyranny.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-the-united-nations-general-assembly-vote-condemn-russias-aggression-against
Joe Biden,"March 10, 2022",Joint Statement by President Biden and President Iván Duque Márquez of Colombia on the U.S.-Colombia Bicentennial Partnership,"We met today to commemorate 200 years of diplomatic relations and to outline a vision for the future for the U.S.-Colombia relationship based on shared prosperity, social equity, the defense of human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the reaffirmation of the hemispheric consensus in favor of democracy enshrined in the Inter-American Democratic Charter.
The United States intends to designate Colombia as a Major Non-NATO Ally in recognition of our uniquely close cooperation in the hemisphere, Colombia's significant contributions as a NATO Global Partner, its commitment to NATO's mission to promote democratic values and commitment to the peaceful resolution of disputes, and its rejection of Russia's unprovoked and unjustifiable aggression against Ukraine.
We committed to expanding longstanding bilateral security cooperation, into a strategic partnership with positive bilateral, regional, and global implications. Recognizing that strengthening Colombia's security is in the national security interest of the United States, we agreed to sustain robust cooperation to combat terrorism and transnational criminal actors, including drug trafficking and the smuggling and trafficking of people, as well as the malign influence of external actors.
We committed to advance our broader drug policy strategy, with a holistic approach to counternarcotics focused on expanding access to evidence-based prevention, treatment, harm reduction, and recovery support services, as well as reducing the supply of illicit drugs through renewed efforts that link eradication, interdiction, drug demand reduction, anti-money laundering efforts and robust rule of law institutions. Our comprehensive approach will combine rural security and development efforts and work to consolidate and sustain peace implementation and reconciliation programs, while ensuring that criminal actors are brought to justice.
In the face of sustained challenges to democracy and universal human rights around the world, we recognized the need for our governments to demonstrate that democracy can deliver to improve the lives of our citizens by cracking down on corruption and promoting transparency, by ensuring a green and equitable recovery to the COVID-19 pandemic. The crisis in Venezuela is a regional challenge and we commit to support the restoration of democracy as necessary to bring an end to the political, economic, and humanitarian crises. In our continued efforts to end the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide, the United States announced the donation of an additional two million vaccine doses to Colombia, including for displaced and migrant communities.
We agreed to prioritize investments in our shared prosperity through the Build Back Better World initiative focused on climate change, health and health technology, digital connectivity, and gender equity. Further, we committed to ensuring that the future of U.S.-Colombia cooperation is guided by a continued commitment to environmental and social justice, as well as racial equity and a respect for human rights.
Finally, we agreed to work on a new framework for how nations throughout the hemisphere collectively manage migration. The current migrant crisis is bigger than any one country and any one border. This is a moment that calls us all to action. The United States and Colombia urge leaders across the Americas to join us in developing a Regional Declaration on Migration and Protection. The Americas have a rich tradition of welcoming refugees and immigrants and showing solidarity with our neighbors. Working hand in hand, we can overcome this current crisis and truly set an example for the rest of the world.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/joint-statement-president-biden-and-president-ivan-duque-marquez-colombia-the-us-colombia
Joe Biden,"March 11, 2022",Joint Statement by Leaders of the Group of Seven (G-7) Nations Announcing Further Economic Costs on Russia,"We the Leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) remain resolved to stand with the Ukrainian people and government who heroically resist Russian President Vladimir Putin's military aggression and war of choice against their sovereign nation. This unprovoked and unjustified attack is causing enormous suffering and a tragic loss of life, including through the increasingly indiscriminate bombing and shelling of civilians in schools, homes, and hospitals.
We are united in our determination to hold President Putin and his regime accountable for this unjustified and unprovoked war that has already isolated Russia in the world. The world should join together in calling on President Putin and his regime to immediately stop its ongoing assault against Ukraine and withdraw its military forces. We stand in solidarity with those who are bravely opposing the invasion of Ukraine.
We urge Russia to ensure safe and unhindered humanitarian access to victims of its assault in Ukraine, and to allow safe passage for civilians wishing to leave. We call for, and commit to provide, humanitarian, medical and financial support to refugees from Ukraine.
Since President Putin launched the Russian Federation's invasion on February 24, our countries have imposed expansive restrictive measures that have severely compromised Russia's economy and financial system, as evidenced by the massive market reactions. We have collectively isolated key Russian banks from the global financial system; blunted the Central Bank of Russia's ability to utilise its foreign reserves; imposed sweeping export bans and controls that cut Russia off from our advanced technologies; and targeted the architects of this war, that is Russian President Vladimir Putin and his accomplices, as well as the Lukashenko regime in Belarus.
In addition to announced plans, we will make further efforts to reduce our reliance on Russian energy, while ensuring that we do so in an orderly fashion and in ways that provide time for the world to secure alternative and sustainable supplies. In addition, private sector companies are leaving Russia with unprecedented speed and solidarity. We stand with our companies that are seeking an orderly withdrawal from the Russian market.
We remain resolved to isolate Russia further from our economies and the international financial system. Consequently, we commit to taking further measures as soon as possible in the context of our ongoing response and consistent with our respective legal authorities and processes:
First, we will endeavor, consistent with our national processes, to take action that will deny Russia Most-Favoured-Nation status relating to key products. This will revoke important benefits of Russia's membership of the World Trade Organization and ensure that the products of Russian companies no longer receive Most-Favoured-Nation treatment in our economies. We welcome the ongoing preparation of a statement by a broad coalition of WTO members, including the G7, announcing their revocation of Russia's Most-Favoured-Nation status.
Second, we are working collectively to prevent Russia from obtaining financing from the leading multilateral financial institutions, including the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Russia cannot grossly violate international law and expect to benefit from being part of the international economic order. We welcome the IMF and World Bank Group's rapid and ongoing efforts to get financial assistance to Ukraine. We also welcome the steps the OECD has taken to restrict Russia's participation in relevant bodies.
Third, we commit to continuing our campaign of pressure against Russian elites, proxies and oligarchs close to President Putin and other architects of the war as well as their families and their enablers. We commend the work done by many of our governments to identify and freeze mobile and immobile assets belonging to sanctioned individuals and entities, and resolve to continue this campaign of pressure as a matter of priority. To that end, we have operationalised the task force announced on February 26, which will target the assets of Russian elites close to President Putin and the architects of his war. Our sanctions packages are carefully targeted so as not to impede the delivery of humanitarian assistance.
Fourth, we commit to maintaining the effectiveness of our restrictive measures, to cracking down on evasion and to closing loop-holes. Specifically, in addition to other measures planned to prevent evasion, we will ensure that the Russian state and elites, proxies and oligarchs cannot leverage digital assets as a means of evading or offsetting the impact of international sanctions, which will further limit their access to the global financial system. It is commonly understood that our current sanctions already cover crypto-assets. We commit to taking measures to better detect and interdict any illicit activity, and we will impose costs on illicit Russian actors using digital assets to enhance and transfer their wealth, consistent with our national processes.
Fifth, we are resolved to fighting off the Russian regime's attempts to spread disinformation. We affirm and support the right of the Russian people to free and unbiased information.
Sixth, we stand ready to impose further restrictions on exports and imports of key goods and technologies on the Russian Federation, which aim at denying Russia revenues and at ensuring that our citizens are not underwriting President Putin's war, consistent with national processes. We note that international companies are already withdrawing from the Russian market. We will make sure that the elites, proxies and oligarchs that support President Putin's war are deprived of their access to luxury goods and assets. The elites who sustain Putin's war machine should no longer be able to reap the gains of this system, squandering the resources of the Russian people.
Seventh, Russian entities directly or indirectly supporting the war should not have access to new debt and equity investments and other forms of international capital. Our citizens are united in the view that their savings and investments should not fund the companies that underpin Russia's economy and war machine. We will continue working together to develop and implement measures that will further limit Russia's ability to raise money internationally.
We stand united and in solidarity with our partners, including developing and emerging economies, which unjustly bear the cost and impact of this war, for which we hold President Putin, his regime and supporters, and the Lukashenko regime, fully responsible. Together, we will work to preserve stability of energy markets as well as food security globally as Russia's invasion threatens Ukraine's capacity to grow crops this year.
We continue to stand with the Ukrainian people and the Government of Ukraine. We will continue to evaluate the impacts of our measures, including on third countries, and are prepared to take further measures to hold President Putin and his regime accountable for his attack on Ukraine.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/joint-statement-leaders-the-group-seven-g-7-nations-announcing-further-economic-costs
Joe Biden,"March 24, 2022",Joint Statement by President Biden and President Ursula von der Leyen of the European Commission,"We are united in our condemnation of Russia's unjustified and unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine. We stand in solidarity with the Ukrainian people, who are bravely defending their homeland, and we call on Russia to end the brutal onslaught against its neighbor. We are united in our support of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. And we are united in our resolve to defend our shared values, including democracy, respect for human rights, global peace and stability, and the rules-based international order.
Today, we are continuing coordinated transatlantic efforts to support the Ukrainian people, impose severe costs on Russia for its unjustifiable actions, and strengthen the resilience of our democracies, economies, and societies. In particular,
The United States and the European Union have strengthened and aligned their sanctions regimes, together with like-minded partners across the world. Additionally, efforts should be stepped up to coordinate responses against sanctions evasion. 
We continue to mobilize and coordinate significant humanitarian relief to support people within Ukraine, those who have been forced to flee, and those affected by the severe impacts Russia's war is causing around the world. This includes more than $1 billion in new humanitarian assistance the United States is prepared to provide on top of the nearly $300 million already contributed and €550 million from the EU. 
The United States and the European Union are coordinating closely to ensure that their efforts on temporary protection and humanitarian admission, including resettlement or transfers, are complementary and provide much-needed support to Ukraine's neighbors. 
We are announcing new actions to bolster democratic resilience and defend human rights in Ukraine and neighboring countries. 
The United States and the European Union are supporting the work of war crimes documentation experts who are gathering evidence on the ground in Ukraine. 
We are taking further, concrete steps in our energy cooperation to ensure the security of supply and to reduce dependence on Russian fossil fuels. 
In order to prevent a potential food crisis triggered by price hikes and disruptions to food supply sparked by Putin's war in Ukraine, we intend to redouble our combined efforts to increase global food security and provide direct food aid, where warranted, to our partners worldwide. 
We will advance our cooperation on cybersecurity through a variety of actions, from supporting the Government of Ukraine on cyber resilience and cyber defense to aiming to combat the abuse of virtual currency.
ANNEX-TRANSATLANTIC COOPERATION AND SUPPORT FOR UKRAINE 
Imposing Additional Costs on Russia 
The United States and the European Union have strengthened and aligned their sanctions regimes, together with our like-minded partners across the world. Today, the United States is sanctioning more than 400 additional individuals and entities to align with measures taken by the EU and our allies and partners. This includes the Duma (Russia's lower house of parliament) and 328 of its members, dozens of defense companies that fuel Putin's war machine and sustain its military industrial base, and more than 20 financial elites, including the head of Russia's largest financial institution. The Commission, in line with its competences, will continue to support further similar measures. Together, we should aim at holding accountable those responsible for the devastation and commit to imposing further costs on Russia until Putin ceases his aggression.
The United States and the European Union are jointly working to blunt Russia's ability to deploy its remaining international reserves, including gold, to prop up its economy and fund its illegal war.
Additionally, as announced in today's G7 leaders' statement, we are establishing an initiative to monitor the full implementation of our sanctions measures and coordinate responses against sanctions evasion. This will ensure that Russia will not be able to backfill or find workarounds that undermine the effect of our sanctions.
Providing Humanitarian Assistance to the Ukrainian People 
We reaffirm our deep support for the Ukrainian people, who are suffering from Russia's devastating bombing of civilians and civilian infrastructure. We urge Russia to facilitate unhindered humanitarian access and permanent safe passage for civilians. We continue to mobilize humanitarian relief to support people within Ukraine and those who have been forced to flee. The United States and the European Union are responding to the humanitarian needs in Ukraine and in countries impacted by the situation in Ukraine. The United States and the European Commission are coordinating closely on the provision of aid, including a through a newly-established high-level dialogue and a U.S. government liaison in the EU's Emergency Response Coordination Centre. Today, the United States is announcing it is prepared to provide more than $1 billion in new funding toward humanitarian assistance for those affected by Russia's war in Ukraine and its severe impacts around the world over the coming months. The European Commission has made available EUR 550 million in emergency and humanitarian assistance and, through the Union Civil Protection Mechanism in cooperation with its partners, it has delivered almost EUR 300 million worth of in-kind assistance.
Welcoming Ukrainians Fleeing Violence 
The European Union has generously welcomed almost three and a half million Ukrainians fleeing Russia's violence, providing them food, shelter, school, and employment opportunities, paying particular attention to the plight of children and providing them protection for the time they need. The United States and the European Union are coordinating closely to ensure that their efforts on temporary protection and humanitarian admission, including resettlement, are complementary and provide much-needed support to Ukraine's neighbors. Today, the United States is announcing plans to welcome up to 100,000 Ukrainians fleeing Russia's aggression through the full range of legal pathways, including the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program.
Partnering to Promote Democratic Resilience and Human Rights 
We steadfastly support the democratic aspirations and fundamental freedoms of the Ukrainian people. Today, we are announcing new commitments to bolster societal resilience and defend human rights in Ukraine and neighboring countries, including Moldova.
To support human rights defenders, anti-corruption watchdogs, journalists, and other members of civil society operating in and around Ukraine, the United States is launching the European Democratic Resilience Initiative (EDRI), which will provide at least $320 million in new funding to these groups and regional governments. The EDRI will support media freedom and counter disinformation, benefit the safety and security of activists and vulnerable groups, strengthen institutions and the region's rule of law, and help ensure accountability for human rights abuses and violations of international law. And it will expand rapid response capabilities and technical assistance to build resilience to Moscow's strategic corruption and kleptocracy.
The European Commission announced plans to reallocate funds from EU programmes to support civil society organizations, human rights defenders, journalists, and pro-democracy activists in Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova. In addition, the European Endowment for Democracy, with EU funding contributions, provided a significant number of emergency grants to contribute to saving and sustaining civic activism and media pluralism in Ukraine. It also opened a Centre for Ukrainian Activists (CUA) in Przemyśl, Poland, to provide support for activists and independent journalists in maintaining and sustaining their connections to their activities inside Ukraine.
Promoting Accountability 
There should be accountability for any war crimes committed in Ukraine. The United States and the European Union are supporting the important work of war crimes documentation experts who are gathering evidence on the ground in Ukraine. The coordination of documentation and evidence preservation efforts to ensure such accountability should be facilitated.
Supporting Europe's Energy Security 
We reconfirm our commitment to Europe's energy security and to accelerating the global transition to clean energy. Energy security and sustainability for the EU and Ukraine are essential for peace, freedom and democracy in Europe. The EU has confirmed its objective to reach independence from Russian gas well before the end of the decade while working to ensure reliable, affordable, and clean energy supplies to citizens and businesses in the EU and its neighbourhood. The United States intends to partner with the EU on these efforts. We understand that the rapid transition to clean energy is essential to advancing EU independence from Russian fossil fuels and are committed to meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement, the objective of net zero emissions by 2050, and keeping a 1.5 degrees Celsius limit on temperature rise within reach. In line with this vision, the European Commission and United States will establish a joint Task Force to address the immediate energy security needs of the EU and accelerate the clean energy transition.
Securing Global Food Supplies 
We are deeply concerned by how Putin's war in Ukraine has caused major disruptions to international food and agriculture supply chains and the threat it poses to global food security. We recognize that many countries around the world have relied on imported food staples and fertilizer inputs from Ukraine and Russia, with Putin's aggression disrupting that trade. As the United States and EU comprise many of the world's major agricultural producers and strong economies, we commit to redoubling our combined efforts to provide direct food aid and other forms of assistance, where warranted, and, to continue the necessary support for agricultural innovation and sustainable productivity growth to ensure global food security, while balancing enhancing climate resilience and reducing agricultural greenhouse gas emissions.
We are committed to working with partners to address the attendant supply challenges and maintaining strong, ruled-based, and open global markets for staple agricultural commodities that feed the world. Specifically, the United States, through Feed the Future and our nutrition commitments, is providing over $11 billion over the next five years to address food security threats and nutrition across the globe. Additionally, the United States will remain one of the top providers of humanitarian food and nutrition assistance globally, having contributed approximately $4.6 billion in humanitarian food and nutrition assistance in 2021. We are also identifying tools in the U.S. government's existing food security tool kit and determining whether programs are fit for purpose for this situation and will make strategic adjustments as needed.
For the period 2021-2024, the EU is pledging at least EUR 2.5 billion for international cooperation related to nutrition. This international cooperation programme will support food systems in about 70 partner countries. The proposed EU Emergency Support Programme for Ukraine of EUR 330 million will secure access to basic goods and services for the Ukrainian population and also support Ukraine's agricultural sector.
Ensuring the Security of Cyberspace 
We are committed to advancing our cybersecurity cooperation, both in response to Russia's illegal further invasion of Ukraine and in support of our longer-term strategic objectives. Together, we will enhance our efforts to coordinate cybersecurity assistance and provide Internet access to the Governments of Ukraine and Moldova, working with Member States and other likeminded partners. In the context of Ukraine and more generally, we will continue to reinforce responsible state behavior in cyberspace and to work together to increase cyber resilience in the face of destructive, disruptive, and destabilizing cyber activity by both States and non-State actors, while also working to hold accountable those responsible for such activity.
We will work towards establishing more structured cybersecurity information exchanges on threats and threat actors and deepen our cooperation on new cybersecurity technologies and standards. We are committed to our partnership in the Counter Ransomware Initiative to disrupt ransomware groups and reduce related threats to our citizens and businesses. We will enhance efforts to address the abuse of virtual currency; bolster cybersecurity resilience; increase partner capacity for detecting and responding to ransomware activity within their own borders; and work to jointly hold accountable states that act as safe havens for ransomware activity.
Combatting Illicit Use of Digital Assets 
We intend to announce deeper collaboration to combat the illicit use of digital assets, including their potential misuse in evading multilateral sanctions imposed in response to Russia's unprovoked military invasion of Ukraine. Together, we intend to deepen our shared commitment to advance anti-money laundering and countering financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) for digital assets, consistent with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) standards.
We will share best practices and coordinate capacity building efforts to help other countries implement AML/CFT frameworks for digital assets. We intend to form a transatlantic sprint between U.S. and EU government officials and, as appropriate, digital asset service providers, to expedite and increase sharing of financial intelligence on illicit use of digital assets. Finally, we will seek opportunities for joint actions against those who facilitate the misuse of digital assets for illicit activity.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/joint-statement-president-biden-and-president-ursula-von-der-leyen-the-european-0
Joe Biden,"March 24, 2022",Joint Statement by North Atlantic Treaty Organization Leaders on Russia's Aggression Against Ukraine,"We, the Heads of State and Government of the 30 NATO Allies, have met today to address Russia's aggression against Ukraine, the gravest threat to Euro-Atlantic security in decades. Russia's war against Ukraine has shattered peace in Europe and is causing enormous human suffering and destruction.
We condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine in the strongest possible terms. We call on President Putin to immediately stop this war and withdraw military forces from Ukraine, and call on Belarus to end its complicity, in line with the Aggression Against Ukraine Resolution adopted at the UN General Assembly of 2 March 2022. Russia should comply with the 16 March ruling by the UN International Court of Justice and immediately suspend military operations. Russia's attack on Ukraine threatens global security. Its assault on international norms makes the world less safe. President Putin's escalatory rhetoric is irresponsible and destabilizing.
Ukrainians have inspired the world with heroic resistance to Russia's brutal war of conquest. We strongly condemn Russia's devastating attacks on civilians, including women, children, and persons in vulnerable situations. We will work with the rest of the international community to hold accountable those responsible for violations of humanitarian and international law, including war crimes. We are deeply concerned about the increased risk of sexual violence and human trafficking. We urge Russia to allow rapid, safe, and unhindered humanitarian access and safe passage for civilians, and to allow for humanitarian aid to be delivered to Mariupol and other besieged cities. We also condemn attacks against civilian infrastructure, including those endangering nuclear power plants. We will continue to counter Russia's lies about its attack on Ukraine and expose fabricated narratives or manufactured ""false flag"" operations to prepare the ground for further escalation, including against the civilian population of Ukraine. Any use by Russia of a chemical or biological weapon would be unacceptable and result in severe consequences.
Russia needs to show it is serious about negotiations by immediately implementing a ceasefire. We call on Russia to engage constructively in credible negotiations with Ukraine to achieve concrete results, starting with a sustainable ceasefire and moving towards a complete withdrawal of its troops from Ukrainian territory. Russia's continuing aggression while discussions are taking place is deplorable. We support Ukraine's efforts to achieve peace, and those undertaken diplomatically by Allies to weigh in on Russia to end the war and relieve human suffering.
We stand in full solidarity with President Zelenskyy, the government of Ukraine, and with the brave Ukrainian citizens who are defending their homeland. We honour all those killed, injured, and displaced by Russia's aggression, as well as their families. We reaffirm our unwavering support for the independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders extending to its territorial waters.
Ukraine has a fundamental right to self-defence under the United Nations Charter. Since 2014, we have provided extensive support to Ukraine's ability to exercise that right. We have trained Ukraine's armed forces, strengthening their military capabilities and capacities and enhancing their resilience. NATO Allies have stepped up their support and will continue to provide further political and practical support to Ukraine as it continues to defend itself. NATO Allies will also continue to provide assistance in such areas as cybersecurity and protection against threats of a chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear nature. NATO Allies also provide extensive humanitarian support and are hosting millions of refugees. Foreign Ministers will discuss further our support to Ukraine when they meet in April.
We are united in our resolve to counter Russia's attempts to destroy the foundations of international security and stability. We are holding Russia and Belarus to account. Massive sanctions and heavy political costs have been imposed on Russia in order to bring an end to this war. We remain determined to maintain coordinated international pressure on Russia. We will continue to coordinate closely with relevant stakeholders and other international organizations, including the European Union. Transatlantic coordination remains crucial for an effective response to the current crisis.
We call on all states, including the People's Republic of China (PRC), to uphold the international order including the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity, as enshrined in the UN Charter, to abstain from supporting Russia's war effort in any way, and to refrain from any action that helps Russia circumvent sanctions. We are concerned by recent public comments by PRC officials and call on China to cease amplifying the Kremlin's false narratives, in particular on the war and on NATO, and to promote a peaceful resolution to the conflict.
We remain committed to the foundational principles underpinning European and global security, including that each nation has the right to choose its own security arrangements free from outside interference. We reaffirm our commitment to NATO's Open Door Policy under Article 10 of the Washington Treaty.
We are providing tailored support to partners affected by Russian threats and interference and will step up our assistance to help them resist Russian malign influence and strengthen their resilience, based on our partners' requests and our long-standing partnership programmes. In April, Foreign Ministers will consider concrete proposals for enhancing our support to these partners.
We will continue to take all necessary steps to protect and defend the security of our Allied populations and every inch of Allied territory. Our commitment to Article 5 of the Washington Treaty is iron-clad.
In response to Russia's actions, we have activated NATO's defence plans, deployed elements of the NATO Response Force, and placed 40,000 troops on our eastern flank, along with significant air and naval assets, under direct NATO command supported by Allies' national deployments. We are also establishing four additional multinational battlegroups in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia. We are taking all measures and decisions to ensure the security and defence of all Allies across all domains and with a 360-degree approach. Our measures remain preventive, proportionate, and non-escalatory. We will now accelerate NATO's transformation for a more dangerous strategic reality, including through the adoption of the next Strategic Concept in Madrid. In light of the gravest threat to Euro-Atlantic security in decades, we will also significantly strengthen our longer term deterrence and defence posture and will further develop the full range of ready forces and capabilities necessary to maintain credible deterrence and defence. These steps will be supported by enhanced exercises with an increased focus on collective defence and interoperability.
We are increasing the resilience of our societies and our infrastructure to counter Russia's malign influence. We are enhancing our cyber capabilities and defences, providing support to each other in the event of cyber-attacks. We are ready to impose costs on those who harm us in cyberspace, and are increasing information exchange and situational awareness, enhancing civil preparedness, and strengthening our ability to respond to disinformation. We will also enhance our preparedness and readiness for chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats. We will take further decisions when we meet in Madrid.
The steps we are taking to ensure the security of our Alliance and of the Euro-Atlantic area will require adequate resourcing. Allies are substantially increasing their defence expenditures. Today, we have decided to accelerate our efforts to fulfil our commitment to the Defence Investment Pledge in its entirety. In line with our commitment in Article 3 of the Washington Treaty, we will further strengthen our individual and collective capacity to resist all forms of attack. At our meeting in Madrid, we will submit additional plans on how to meet the Pledge.
Russia's unprovoked war against Ukraine represents a fundamental challenge to the values and norms that have brought security and prosperity to all on the European continent. President Putin's choice to attack Ukraine is a strategic mistake, with grave consequences also for Russia and the Russian people. We remain united and resolute in our determination to oppose Russia's aggression, aid the government and the people of Ukraine, and defend the security of all Allies.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/joint-statement-north-atlantic-treaty-organization-leaders-russias-aggression-against
Joe Biden,"March 24, 2022",Statement on the Extraordinary North Atlantic Treaty Organization Summit,"NATO leaders met today on the 1-month anniversary of Russia's unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine to reiterate our strong support for the Ukrainian people, our determination to hold Russia accountable for its brutal war, and our commitment to strengthening the NATO alliance. We had the privilege of hearing directly from President Zelenskyy, and we will continue to support him and his government with significant, and increasing, amounts of security assistance to fight Russian aggression and uphold their right to self-defense.
In the past few weeks, the United States has announced $1 billion in new security assistance to Ukraine: anti-aircraft systems, anti-armor weapons, drones, and millions of rounds of ammunition. I welcome the steps by many other allies to provide defensive support to Ukraine and together, we are committed to identifying additional equipment, including air defense systems, to help Ukraine.
We also discussed our work to bolster NATO's collective defense, particularly on the eastern flank. Our joint statement today makes clear that NATO is as strong and united as it has ever been. Immediately after Russia's further invasion of Ukraine, we activated NATO's defensive plans and the NATO Response Force. The United States has surged thousands of forces and additional capabilities to Europe, and we have welcomed the new deployments made by our allies. Today's establishment of four new battle groups in Slovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary is a strong signal that we will collectively defend and protect every inch of NATO territory. Between now and the NATO summit in June, we will develop plans for additional forces and capabilities to strengthen NATO's defenses. We will adopt an updated strategic concept to ensure NATO is ready to meet any challenge in the new and more dangerous security environment.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-the-extraordinary-north-atlantic-treaty-organization-summit
Joe Biden,"March 24, 2022",Joint Statement by Group of Seven (G-7) Nations Leaders on Russia's Aggression Against Ukraine,"1. We, the Leaders of the G7, met today in Brussels at the invitation of the German G7 Presidency, to further strengthen our cooperation in light of Russia's unjustifiable, unprovoked and illegal aggression and President Putin's war of choice against independent and sovereign Ukraine. We will stand with the government and people of Ukraine.
2. We are united in our resolve to restore peace and stability and uphold international law. Following the United Nations General Assembly resolution on 2 March 2022, we will continue to stand with the overwhelming majority of the international community, in condemning Russia's military aggression and the suffering and loss of life it continues to cause.
3. We remain appalled by and condemn the devastating attacks on the Ukrainian population and civilian infrastructure, including hospitals and schools. We welcome the investigations of international mechanisms, including by the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court. We will work together to support the gathering of evidence of war crimes. The siege of Mariupol and other Ukrainian cities, and the denial of humanitarian access by Russian military forces are unacceptable. Russian forces must immediately provide for safe pathways to other parts of Ukraine, as well as humanitarian aid to be delivered to Mariupol and other besieged cities.
4. The Russian leadership is obligated to immediately comply with the order of the International Court of Justice to suspend the military operations that it commenced on 24 February 2022 in the territory of Ukraine, without any further delay. We also urge Russia to withdraw its military forces and equipment from the entire territory of Ukraine.
5. We further call upon the Belarusian authorities to avoid further escalation and to refrain from using their military forces against Ukraine. Moreover, we urge all countries not to give military or other assistance to Russia to help continue its aggression in Ukraine. We will be vigilant regarding any such assistance.
6. We will spare no efforts to hold President Putin and the architects and supporters of this aggression, including the Lukashenko regime in Belarus, accountable for their actions. To this end, we will continue to work together, along with our allies and partners around the world.
7. We underline our resolve to impose severe consequences on Russia, including by fully implementing the economic and financial measures we already imposed. We will continue to cooperate closely, including by engaging other governments on adopting similar restrictive measures to those already imposed by G7 members and on refraining from evasion, circumvention and backfilling that seek to undercut or mitigate the effects of our sanctions. We task the relevant Ministers in a focused initiative to monitor the full implementation of sanctions and to coordinate responses related to evasive measures, including regarding gold transactions by the Central Bank of Russia. We stand ready to apply additional measures as required, continuing to act in unity as we do so. We commend those partners who have aligned with us in these efforts.
8. Russia's attack has already risked the safety and security of nuclear sites in Ukraine. Russian military activities are creating extreme risks for the population and the environment, with the potential for catastrophic result. Russia must comply with its international obligations and refrain from any activity that imperils nuclear sites, allowing unhindered control by the Ukrainian authorities, as well as full access by and cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency.
9. We warn against any threat of the use of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons or related materials. We recall Russia's obligations under the international treaties to which it is a signatory, and which protect us all. In this regard, we categorically denounce Russia's malicious and completely unfounded disinformation campaign against Ukraine, a state in full compliance with international non-proliferation agreements. We express concern about other countries and actors that have amplified Russia's disinformation campaign.
10. We are resolved in our support to the Ukrainian people in their heroic resistance to Russia's unjustifiable and illegal aggression. We will step up our support to Ukraine and neighbouring countries. We thank all those who are already providing humanitarian aid to Ukraine and ask others to join. We will furthermore collaborate in our efforts to bolster democratic resilience and defend human rights in Ukraine and neighbouring countries.
11. We will continue efforts to support Ukraine in defending its networks against cyber incidents. In preparation for any Russian malicious cyber response to the actions we have taken, we are taking steps to increase the resilience of the infrastructure in our respective nations by strengthening our coordinated cyber defences and improving our shared awareness of cyber threats. We will also work to hold accountable those actors that engage in destructive, disruptive, or destabilising activities in cyberspace.
12. We further commend neighbouring states for their solidarity and humanity in welcoming Ukrainian refugees and third country nationals from Ukraine. We highlight the need to further increase international assistance to countries neighbouring Ukraine, and, as a concrete contribution to this end, underline our commitment to receiving, protecting, and supporting refugees and displaced persons as a consequence of the conflict. We thus all stand ready to welcome them on our territories. We will take further steps to broaden our support to Ukraine and neighbouring countries.
13. We are concerned by the escalating and reinforced repression against the Russian people and the increasingly hostile rhetoric of the Russian leadership, including against ordinary citizens. We deplore the Russian leadership's attempt to deprive Russian citizens of access to unbiased information through censorship, and denounce its malicious disinformation campaigns, which we will not leave unaddressed. We express our support to those Russian and Belarusian citizens standing up against the unjustified war of aggression against their close neighbour Ukraine. The world sees them.
14. The people of Russia must know that we hold no grievances against them. It is President Putin, his government and supporters, including the Lukashenko regime in Belarus, who are imposing this war and its consequences on Russians and it is their decision that besmirches the history of the Russian people.
15. We are taking further steps to reduce our reliance on Russian energy, and will work together to this end. At the same time, we will ensure secure alternative and sustainable supplies, and act in solidarity and close coordination in the case of possible supply disruptions. We commit to actively support countries willing to phase out their dependency on Russian gas, oil and coal imports. We call on oil and gas producing countries to act in a responsible manner and to increase deliveries to international markets, noting that OPEC has a key role to play. We will work with them and all partners to ensure stable and sustainable global energy supplies. This crisis reinforces our determination to meet the goals of the Paris agreement and of the Glasgow climate pact and limit the rise in global temperatures to 1.5°C, by accelerating reduction of our reliance on fossil fuels and our transition to clean energy.
16. We stand in solidarity with our partners who have to bear the rising price of President Putin's unilateral choice to wage war in Europe. His decision is putting the global economic recovery at risk, undermines the resilience of global value chains and will have severe impacts on the most fragile countries. We call on the international community to take action by fully recognising Russia's responsibility and protecting the most vulnerable countries, with the support of international and regional institutions.
17. More immediately, President Putin's war places global food security under increased pressure. We recall that the implementation of our sanctions against Russia takes into account the need to avoid impact on global agricultural trade. We remain determined to monitor the situation closely and do what is necessary to prevent and respond to the evolving global food security crisis. We will make coherent use of all instruments and funding mechanisms to address food security, and build resilience in the agriculture sector in line with climate and environment goals. We will address potential agricultural production and trade disruptions, in particular in vulnerable countries. We commit to provide a sustainable food supply in Ukraine and support continued Ukrainian production efforts.
18. We will work with and step up our collective contribution to relevant international institutions including the World Food Programme (WFP), in parallel with Multilateral Development Banks and International Financial Institutions, to provide support to countries with acute food insecurity. We call for an extraordinary session of the Council of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) to address the consequences on world food security and agriculture arising from the Russian aggression against Ukraine. We call on all participants of the Agriculture Markets Information System (AMIS) to continue to share information and explore options to keep prices under control, including making stocks available, in particular to the WFP. We will avoid export bans and other trade-restrictive measures, maintain open and transparent markets, and call on others to do likewise, consistent with World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, including WTO notification requirements.
19. International organisations and multilateral fora should no longer conduct their activities with Russia in a business as usual manner. We will work closely with our partners to act as appropriate, based on shared interests, as well as rules and regulations of respective institutions.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/joint-statement-group-seven-g-7-nations-leaders-russias-aggression-against-ukraine
Joe Biden,"March 25, 2022",Joint Statement by the United States and the European Commission on European Energy Security,"Preamble 
The United States and the European Commission are committed to reducing Europe's dependency on Russian energy. We reaffirm our joint commitment to Europe's energy security and sustainability and to accelerating the global transition to clean energy. In condemning in the strongest terms Russia's further invasion of Ukraine, we express our solidarity and support for Ukraine. We share the objective of addressing the energy security emergency— to ensure energy supply for the EU and Ukraine. We welcome the continued progress toward the physical integration of Ukraine with the EU energy markets. The energy security and sustainability of the EU and Ukraine are essential for peace, freedom and democracy in Europe.
Through the Joint European action for more affordable, secure and sustainable energy (REPowerEU), the EU confirmed its objective to reach independence from Russian fossil fuels well before the end of the decade, replacing them with stable, affordable, reliable, and clean energy supplies for EU citizens and businesses.
The United States and the EU are committed to meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement, achieving the objective of net zero emissions by 2050, and keeping a 1.5 degrees Celsius limit on temperature rise within reach, including through a rapid clean energy transition, renewable energy, and energy efficiency. These policies and technologies will also contribute to making the EU independent from Russian fossil fuels. Natural gas remains an important part of the EU energy system in the green transition, including by ensuring its carbon intensity decreases over time.
The United States and European Commission confirm our strategic energy cooperation for security of energy supply and reducing dependence on fossil fuels. We share efforts to make available stable, affordable, reliable and clean energy supplies to citizens and businesses in the EU and its neighbouring partner nations. In this framework, we establish an immediate cooperation to address the emergency energy security objective of ensuring appropriate levels of gas storage ahead of next winter and the following one. We will continue our close cooperation on other measures to accelerate the green energy transition, lower energy consumption and reduce dependence on fossil fuels.
Task Force on Energy Security 
The United States and the European Commission will immediately establish a joint Task Force on Energy Security to set out the parameters of this cooperation and execute its implementation. The Task Force will be chaired by a representative from the White House and a representative of the President of the European Commission.
This Task Force will focus on the following urgent issues:
The United States will strive to ensure, including working with international partners, additional liquified natural gas (LNG) volumes for the EU market of at least 15 bcm in 2022 with expected increases going forward. 
The United States and European Commission will undertake efforts to reduce the greenhouse gas intensity of all new LNG infrastructure and associated pipelines, including through the use of clean energy to power onsite operations, the reduction of methane leakage, and the construction of clean and renewable hydrogen ready infrastructure. • The United States commits to maintaining an enabling regulatory environment with procedures to review and expeditiously act upon applications to permit any additional export LNG capacities that would be needed to meet this emergency energy security objective and support the RePowerEU goals, affirming the joint resolve to terminate EU dependence on Russian fossil fuels by 2027. 
The European Commission will work with the governments of EU Member States to accelerate their regulatory procedures to review and determine approvals for LNG import infrastructure, to include onshore facilities and related pipelines to support imports using floating storage regasification unit vessels, and fixed LNG import terminals. 
The European Commission will work with EU Member States and market operators to pool demand through a newly established EU Energy platform for additional volumes between April and October 2022. The European Commission will also support long-term contracting mechanisms and partner with the U.S. to encourage relevant contracting to support final investment decisions on both LNG export and import infrastructure. 
The European Commission will work with EU Member States toward ensuring stable demand for additional U.S. LNG until at least 2030 of approximately 50 bcm/annum, on the understanding that the price formula of LNG supplies to the EU should reflect long-term market fundamentals, and stability of the cooperation of the demand and supply side, and that this growth be consistent with our shared net zero goals. In particular, price formula should include consideration of Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Price and other stabilising factors. 
The EU is preparing an upgraded regulatory framework for energy security of supply and storage. This will enhance certainty and predictability regarding security of supply and storage needs and ensure closer cooperation within the EU and its neighbouring partner nations. The European Commission has proposed regulation on energy storage to ensure that the existing storage infrastructure is filled up to 90% of its capacity by 1 November each year, with specific phase-in provisions for 2022. The European Commission will coordinate with the Member States and provide transparency with respect to available LNG capacity in EU terminals. 
The United States and the European Commission will engage key stakeholders, including the private sector, to formulate immediate recommendations that will reduce overall gas demand through accelerating market deployment and utilization of clean energy technologies and measures in Europe and the United States such as: 
Partnering on technologies and energy efficiency solutions such as ramping up demand response devices (such as smart thermostats) and heat pump deployment and installations, scaling procurement for clean energy equipment, investing in innovative technologies and fuel-switching away from fossil fuels. 
Expediting planning and approval for renewable energy projects and strategic energy cooperation including in offshore wind technologies. 
Developing a strategy to accelerate workforce development to support the rapidly deployment of clean energy technologies, including an expansion of solar and wind. 
Collaborating to advance the production and use of clean and renewable hydrogen to displace unabated fossil fuels and cut greenhouse gas emissions, including by investing in technology development and supporting infrastructure. 

The European Commission is working to advance measures that reduce gas consumption by maximizing renewable energy generation and utilization, including by reducing curtailment rates. 
The United States and the European Commission are resolved to negotiate and then implement an ambitious emissions-based Global Arrangement on Steel and Aluminum Trade that incentives industrial decarbonization and lowers energy demand.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/joint-statement-the-united-states-and-the-european-commission-european-energy-security
Joe Biden,"March 28, 2022",Statement on the Fiscal Year 2023 Budget,"Budgets are statements of values, and the budget I am releasing today sends a clear message that we value fiscal responsibility, safety and security at home and around the world, and the investments needed to continue our equitable growth and build a better America.
My administration is on track to reduce the Federal deficit by more than $1.3 trillion this year, cutting in half the deficit from the last year of the previous administration and delivering the largest 1-year reduction in the deficit in U.S. history. That's the direct result of my administration's strategy to get the pandemic under control and grow the economy from the bottom up and the middle out. We spent less money than the last administration and got better results: strong economic growth, which has increased revenues and allowed us to responsibly scale back emergency spending. My budget will continue that progress, further reducing the deficit by continuing to support the economic growth that has increased revenues and ensuring that billionaires and large corporations pay their fair share.
At the same time, my budget will make investments in securing our Nation and building a better America. We will secure our communities by putting more police on the street to engage in accountable community policing, hiring the agents needed to help fight gun crime, and investing in crime prevention and community violence intervention.
I'm calling for one of the largest investments in our national security in history, with the funds needed to ensure that our military remains the best prepared, best trained, best equipped military in the world. In addition, I'm calling for continued investment to forcefully respond to Putin's aggression against Ukraine with U.S. support for Ukraine's economic, humanitarian, and security needs.
My budget also makes the investments needed to reduce costs for families and make progress on my unity agenda, including investments to cut the costs of child care and health care, help families pay for other essentials, end cancer as we know it, support our veterans, and get all Americans the mental health services they need.
All told, it is a budget that includes historic deficit reduction, historic investments in our security at home and abroad, and an unprecedented commitment to building an economy where everyone has a chance to succeed.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-the-fiscal-year-2023-budget
Joe Biden,"March 29, 2022",Joint Statement by President Biden and Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong of Singapore,"President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. is honored to welcome Prime Minister of the Republic of Singapore Lee Hsien Loong to Washington, D.C. The U.S.-Singapore strategic partnership is anchored in our shared respect for the rules-based international order, adherence to international law, and the principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter—including respect for sovereignty, the peaceful resolution of disputes, cooperation among nations, and fundamental human rights. These principles have underpinned decades of unprecedented peace and stability as well as economic and social development, in the Indo-Pacific region and around the world.
The United States and Singapore recognize that threats to the UN Charter and rules-based international order anywhere, including Russia's unprovoked attack on Ukraine, place peace and prosperity everywhere at risk. The war in Ukraine has a negative impact on the Indo-Pacific region, which already faces many complex challenges. Taken together, the opportunities and challenges of the 21st century demand deeper cooperation between us.
The leaders welcome the enduring strength of the bilateral strategic partnership, marked by Singapore's unique status as a Major Security Cooperation Partner, by the 5,400 U.S. companies that call Singapore home, by the countries' close people-to-people ties, and by the series of high-level bilateral visits during the first year of the Biden-Harris Administration. The leaders resolve to further expand bilateral cooperation, taking bold new steps to drive broad-based economic growth and innovation, raise infrastructure standards in the region, address the climate crisis, promote health security, increase supply chain resilience, improve cybersecurity, ensure the long-term sustainability of outer space activities, and more. As we strengthen our partnership, we will promote a world in which all nations, large and small, can stand together as equals to tackle the most pressing challenges of our era and deliver for our people.
Upholding the Rules-Based International Order 
President Biden reiterates the sustained and growing commitment of the United States to its allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific region, as described in the Indo-Pacific Strategy of the United States. President Biden and Prime Minister Lee reaffirm their strong support for ASEAN Centrality and the ASEAN-centered regional architecture. Prime Minister Lee welcomes President Biden's invitation to ASEAN leaders for a historic ASEAN-U.S. Special Summit in Washington, D.C. The leaders highlight the success of the U.S.-Singapore Third Country Training Program, which has received more than 1700 officials from across ASEAN. The United States seeks cooperation with all partners who share our objectives in the Indo-Pacific region, and to that end, we welcome the Quad's support for ASEAN Centrality, deeper economic integration, addressing of regional challenges, and promotion of an open, inclusive, stable and secure Indo-Pacific region and a rules-based order. We also welcome the enhanced engagement of European and regional partners in Southeast Asia and the broader Indo-Pacific region.
The United States and Singapore emphasize our unwavering commitment to the principles of sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity, and condemn Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, which clearly violates international law, including the United Nations Charter. The United States and Singapore recognize the need to preserve a world in which borders cannot be changed by force and state-to-state relations are guided by international law. Given the unprovoked attack on Ukraine, many countries across the Atlantic and the Pacific, including the United States and Singapore, have imposed their own financial sanctions and export controls against Russian entities. The United States and Singapore will ensure the effective implementation of their respective measures. The United States and Singapore are deeply concerned about the deteriorating humanitarian crisis in and around Ukraine, and call on all parties to allow safe and unfettered passage of civilians, facilitate unhindered access to humanitarian assistance for those in need in Ukraine, protect civilians, and respect human rights.
Amid global security challenges, the United States and Singapore continue to build on our partnership to pursue our shared interests. The leaders reaffirm a shared commitment to the goal of the complete denuclearization and the establishment of a permanent peace on the Korean Peninsula. Both leaders call on the DPRK to engage in serious and sustained diplomacy and emphasize the importance of full implementation of relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions. The leaders underscore the importance of peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region and encourage the peaceful resolution of disputes. President Biden and Prime Minister Lee also reflected on the close counterterrorism partnership shared by the United States and Singapore, and Singapore's support of the United States relocation efforts related to Afghanistan last year.
In the maritime domain, the United States and Singapore reaffirm the right of freedom of navigation and overflight and other lawful uses of the seas accorded by international law, including the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). We reaffirm the need to pursue peaceful resolution of disputes in accordance with international law, including UNCLOS, which sets out the legal framework within which all activities in the oceans and seas must be carried out. We respect states' ability to conserve, sustainably develop, and effectively manage their maritime natural resources in accordance with international law, including UNCLOS. We reaffirm that all concerned parties must abide by the 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, and reiterate our support for ASEAN-led efforts to develop an effective and substantive Code of Conduct for the South China Sea that upholds the legitimate rights and interests of all parties and is consistent with UNCLOS. We also affirm the importance of acting consistently with the relevant Standards and Recommended Practices of the International Civil Aviation Organization, and the relevant instruments and conventions of the International Maritime Organization.
The United States and Singapore share deep concerns about the situation in Myanmar and the challenges it poses to regional stability. We continue to call for an end to violence against civilians in Myanmar, the release of all political detainees, including State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, President Win Myint and foreign detainees; unhindered humanitarian access; and for Myanmar to return to its path of democratic transition. We appreciate the constructive role played by Singapore and ASEAN in facilitating a peaceful solution in the interest of the people of Myanmar, and we call for the Myanmar military regime to urgently implement the ASEAN Five Point Consensus. We are concerned the crisis has reversed years of economic progress in Myanmar and increased the risk of illicit finance.
Driving Inclusive Prosperity and Addressing Emerging Challenges 
President Biden and Prime Minister Lee underscore their shared commitment to promoting broad-based economic growth in the United States, in Singapore, and throughout the region. They reaffirm the close collaboration between the United States and Singapore on developing an Indo-Pacific economic framework with regional partners that will expand cooperation on trade, supply chains, clean energy, decarbonization, infrastructure, tax, and anti-corruption. They welcome Thailand's leadership as host of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) in 2022, and look forward to the United States hosting APEC in 2023. The leaders reviewed ongoing efforts to facilitate regional trade and increase supply chain resilience and looked forward to the implementation of the U.S.-ASEAN Economic Futures initiative.
The leaders also look forward to expanding economic cooperation under the U.S.-Singapore Partnership for Growth and Innovation (PGI), which aims to secure inclusive growth for our economies and regions in new and forward-looking areas: digital economy, energy and environmental technology, advanced manufacturing, and health services. New initiatives announced under the PGI include the development of interoperable ethical Artificial Intelligence governance frameworks, and plans for a U.S. business development mission to Singapore to facilitate new business opportunities and strengthen partnerships in advanced manufacturing.
President Biden and Prime Minister Lee commit to deepening cooperation between the United States and Singapore on high quality infrastructure development in the region. To that end, the United States and Singapore renewed and expanded the MOU to deepen cooperation on infrastructure development to cover new collaborations in green and sustainable infrastructure projects in the region that address social and economic needs and promote inclusive, private sector-led growth.
The climate crisis poses an existential threat to the world. Recognizing the need to enhance ambition in this decisive decade, the United States has put forward an ambitious target to achieve a 50-52 percent reduction from 2005 levels in economy-wide net greenhouse gas pollution in 2030 and to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by no later than 2050, and Singapore has announced it will raise its climate ambition to achieve net-zero emissions by or around mid-century, and will be making a formal revision to both its Nationally Determined Contribution and Long-Term Low-Emissions Development Strategy (LEDS) later this year after consulting closely with key stakeholders. We commit to strengthening the U.S.-Singapore Climate Partnership, and we look forward to working with other countries to implement the Paris Agreement. President Biden and Prime Minister Lee recognize that decarbonizing the shipping sector is essential to transitioning to a clean energy economy and they commit to working together to advance green shipping, including by establishing alternative bunkering infrastructure for the provision of low- and zero-carbon fuels at our ports.
The United States and Singapore highlight their shared commitment to bolstering global health security and building back better from the COVID-19 pandemic, and preparing for further pandemics and other shocks to health systems. We must work with allies and partners to strengthen and finance vaccine readiness and accelerate efforts to control COVID-19 globally, for example by working with global health organizations such as the World Health Organization, GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.
The United States and Singapore affirm the importance of ensuring that critical and emerging technologies foster an open, accessible, and secure technology ecosystem, based on mutual trust, confidence, and respect for a rules-based international order. To this end, we commit to increasing resiliency in our technology supply chains, and developing robust approaches to data governance and security, seeking consistency and interoperability where feasible. We also plan to explore R&D and other collaborations, including through the PGI, in order to progress towards affordable, resilient, secure and interoperable advanced high-speed wireless communications (""NextG"") in the Indo-Pacific region.
The United States and Singapore maintain a strong and growing partnership on cybersecurity. We seek global adherence to the UN framework of responsible state behavior in cyberspace and pledge to deepen our cooperation on combating cyber threats, promoting resilience, and securing our critical infrastructure, amongst other issues. We welcome the establishment of the United States-Singapore Cyber Dialogue to cement our cross institutional linkages to jointly tackle cybersecurity issues. We will continue to jointly lead critical efforts in the International Counter Ransomware Initiative to tackle the surge in ransomware attacks worldwide.
The United States and Singapore believe in the importance of creating a safe, stable, secure, and sustainable space environment that facilitates space exploration, science, and commercial activities that benefit all of humanity. President Biden welcomes Singapore's commitment to the Artemis Accords. President Biden and Prime Minister Lee also welcome the convening of a United States-Singapore Space Dialogue.
Today's challenges all demand closer cooperation between us. For many decades the United States and Singapore have worked together to overcome the challenges of the day, and we will continue to do so, with determination and resolve. Together, we are deepening our strategic partnership to seize opportunities and address emerging threats. We are defending and strengthening the rules-based international order that has long supported global security and prosperity, and will continue to do so long into the future.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/joint-statement-president-biden-and-prime-minister-lee-hsien-loong-singapore
Joe Biden,"April 05, 2022","Joint Statement by President Biden, Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia, and Prime Minister Boris Johnson of the United Kingdom on the Australia-United Kingdom-United States (AUKUS) Partnership on Weapons Development and Defense Cooperation","Today, the leaders of the Australia-UK-US (AUKUS) partnership—Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia, Prime Minister Boris Johnson of the United Kingdom, and President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. of the United States—assessed progress under AUKUS.
We reaffirmed our commitment to AUKUS and to a free and open Indo-Pacific. In light of Russia's unprovoked, unjustified, and unlawful invasion of Ukraine, we reiterated our unwavering commitment to an international system that respects human rights, the rule of law, and the peaceful resolution of disputes free from coercion.
We are pleased with the progress in our trilateral program for Australia to establish a conventionally armed, nuclear powered submarine capability. We are fully committed to establishing a robust approach to sharing naval propulsion technology with Australia that strengthens the global non-proliferation regime.
We also committed today to commence new trilateral cooperation on hypersonics and counter-hypersonics, and electronic warfare capabilities, as well as to expand information sharing and to deepen cooperation on defense innovation. These initiatives will add to our existing efforts to deepen cooperation on cyber capabilities, artificial intelligence, quantum technologies, and additional undersea capabilities. As our work progresses on these and other critical defense and security capabilities, we will seek opportunities to engage allies and close partners.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/joint-statement-president-biden-prime-minister-scott-morrison-australia-and-prime-0
Joe Biden,"April 07, 2022",Statement on the United Nations Vote Suspending Russia From the Human Rights Council,"I applaud the overwhelming vote today in the General Assembly of the United Nations to kick Russia off the U.N. Human Rights Council. This is a meaningful step by the international community further demonstrating how Putin's war has made Russia an international pariah.
The United States worked closely with our allies and partners around the world to drive this vote because Russia is committing gross and systemic violations of human rights. Russian forces are committing war crimes. Russia has no place on the Human Rights Council. After today's historic vote, Russia will not be able to participate in the Council's work or spread its disinformation there as the Council's Commission of Inquiry investigates Russia's violations and abuses of human rights in Ukraine.
The images we are seeing out of Bucha and other areas of Ukraine as Russian troops withdraw are horrifying. The signs of people being raped, tortured, executed—in some cases having their bodies desecrated—are an outrage to our common humanity. Russia's lies are no match for the undeniable evidence of what is happening in Ukraine. That's why nations in every region condemn Russia's unprovoked and brutal aggression against Ukraine and support the brave people of Ukraine in their fight for freedom. And we will continue to work with responsible nations around the world to gather evidence to hold Russia accountable for the atrocities being committed, increase the pressure on Russia's economy, and isolate Russia on the international stage.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-the-united-nations-vote-suspending-russia-from-the-human-rights-council
Joe Biden,"April 08, 2022",Statement on Delivery of Air Defense Systems to Ukraine,"Since the outset of my administration, the United States has placed the highest priority on delivering critical military capabilities to Ukraine so it can defend itself against Russian aggression. The entire world has now witnessed the effectiveness of those weapons, as courageous Ukrainian forces have used them to repel the Russian attack on Kyiv, keep the skies of Ukraine contested, and deliver severe blows to the Russian military.
In addition to U.S.-produced weapons, we have also worked to facilitate the transfer of capabilities from our allies and partners around the world. I want to thank the Slovakian Government for providing an S-300 air defense system to Ukraine, something President Zelenskyy has personally raised with me in our conversations. To enable this transfer and ensure the continued security of Slovakia, the United States will reposition a U.S. Patriot missile system to Slovakia.
Now is no time for complacency. The Russian military may have failed in its objective of capturing Kyiv, but it continues to inflict horrific acts of brutality on the Ukrainian people. As the Russian military repositions for the next phase of this war, I have directed my administration to continue to spare no effort to identify and provide to the Ukrainian military the advanced weapons capabilities it needs to defend its country.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-delivery-air-defense-systems-ukraine
Joe Biden,"April 13, 2022",Statement on the President's Call With President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine and Additional Security Assistance to Ukraine,"I just spoke with President Zelenskyy and shared with him that my administration is authorizing an additional $800 million in weapons, ammunition, and other security assistance to Ukraine. The Ukrainian military has used the weapons we are providing to devastating effect. As Russia prepares to intensify its attack in the Donbas region, the United States will continue to provide Ukraine with the capabilities to defend itself.
This new package of assistance will contain many of the highly effective weapons systems we have already provided and new capabilities tailored to the wider assault we expect Russia to launch in eastern Ukraine. These new capabilities include artillery systems, artillery rounds, and armored personnel carriers. I have also approved the transfer of additional helicopters. In addition, we continue to facilitate the transfer of significant capabilities from our allies and partners around the world.
The steady supply of weapons the United States and its allies and partners have provided to Ukraine has been critical in sustaining its fight against the Russian invasion. It has helped ensure that Putin failed in his initial war aims to conquer and control Ukraine. We cannot rest now. As I assured President Zelenskyy, the American people will continue to stand with the brave Ukrainian people in their fight for freedom.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-the-presidents-call-with-president-volodymyr-zelenskyy-ukraine-and-additional
Joe Biden,"April 15, 2022",Statement on the Observance of Passover,"Tonight Jewish communities in the United States, Israel, and around the world will celebrate Passover, a holiday whose ancient story has inspired humanity for millennia.
For many, this will mark the first time in three years that families and friends will be able to gather around the Seder table, a testament to the lifesaving miracle of modern medicine and the progress we've made to address an unforgiving pandemic.
Together again, we will commemorate the Exodus of the enslaved Israelites from Egypt. And we will retell a timeless story about that most human quest for freedom: redemption, faith, hope, and ultimately, deliverance; a story that has brought solace and a sense of promise to Jewish communities throughout their history as they endured acts of persecution, pogroms, and even genocide; and one that inspired and empowered oppressed peoples everywhere who, even in their deepest despair, sensed that their own liberation was not beyond reach.
This Passover, we hold in our hearts the people of Ukraine and those around the world whose heroic stand against tyranny inspires us all. The enduring spirit of this holiday continues to teach us that with faith, the driest desert can be crossed, the mightiest sea can be split, and hope never stops marching towards the promised land.
To all those celebrating this Festival of Freedom, Jill and I wish you and your loved ones a happy Passover. Chag Sameach!",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-the-observance-passover-4
Joe Biden,"April 28, 2022",Statement on the National Economy,"The American economy—powered by working families—continues to be resilient in the face of historic challenges. Last quarter, consumer spending, business investment, and residential investment increased at strong rates. The number of Americans on unemployment insurance remains at the lowest level since 1970. Later this morning I will meet with small-business owners who are creating and growing their businesses at a historic rate. While last quarter's growth estimate was affected by technical factors, the United States confronts the challenges of COVID-19 around the world, Putin's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, and global inflation from a position of strength.
We need to keep making progress: cutting costs for working families, making more in America, and creating good-paying jobs you can raise a middleclass family on. Congressional Republicans, led by Senator Scott, believe the way to fight these global challenges is by raising taxes on middle class families, including half of small-business owners. I have a different approach. Congress should send to my desk a bipartisan innovation bill to bolster our supply chains and make more in America. And Congress needs to pass legislation to lower costs and lower the deficit, reducing families' prescription drug and utility bills and restoring fairness to our Tax Code, without raising taxes on anyone making less than $400,000 per year. That's how we grow our economy and strengthen the middle class.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-the-national-economy-22
Joe Biden,"May 03, 2022",Statement on World Press Freedom Day,"We live in perilous times for press freedom. At least eleven journalists have been killed in Ukraine in recent weeks. Another 11 have been wounded by gunfire. Others have been kidnapped and assaulted, and at least one remains missing. In Russia, the Kremlin has tightened its vice grip on civil society, including through passage of a ""disinformation"" law intended to silence those speaking the truth. Facing the choice of repression and censorship or the threat of retribution, Russian journalists, and other members of the media have made the difficult choice to flee their country.
This is the price media workers and their families are paying to tell us the story of Putin's unjust and brutal war in Ukraine. And it is the price paid around the world by journalists who have dedicated their lives to keep the world informed and share the truth.
Journalists cover war, expose corruption, document environmental damage, lift up the marginalized, champion our communities, and hold the powerful to account. And for this, too often, they are killed, jailed, raped, threatened, and harassed. Women journalists, long a minority in the newsroom, are disproportionately targeted, on- and offline, in these attacks.
In the United States, national and local media are covering a once-in-a-century pandemic, a generational reckoning on race, and the existential threat of climate change.
The free press is not the enemy of the people. Quite the opposite, when driven by a quest to illuminate and educate, not inflame or entertain, the free press is the guardian of truth.
Over the past 5 years, UNESCO estimates that 85 percent of the world's population have experienced a decline in press freedom. That's why, at the first Summit for Democracy last December, I announced a series of new initiatives—from new programs to protect journalists from spurious lawsuits, to seed funding for the International Fund for Public Interest Media, to expanded support for at-risk reporters—that elevate a renewed commitment by the United States to champion fact-based reporting and independent media globally. Foreign governments, civil society, and the private sector also have an important roles to play in sustaining this vital work, and the United States stands ready to be a partner in all these efforts.
Collectively, we can and must do more to protect and sustain independent media, and to hold to account those that seek to silence voices essential to transparent, trustworthy, and responsive governance.
On this World Press Freedom Day, I honor the courage and sacrifice of journalists around the world, and commend all those who strive to inform, educate, and enlighten. The work of free and independent media matters now more than ever.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-world-press-freedom-day-7
Joe Biden,"May 06, 2022",Statement on Additional United States Security Assistance to Ukraine,"Today the United States is continuing our strong support for the brave people of Ukraine as they defend their country against Russia's ongoing aggression. I am announcing another package of security assistance that will provide additional artillery munitions, radars, and other equipment to Ukraine.
The United States has provided a historic amount of security assistance to Ukraine at rapid speed. We are sending the weapons and equipment that Congress has authorized directly to the frontlines of freedom in Ukraine. U.S. support, together with the contributions of our allies and partners, has been critical in helping Ukraine win the battle of Kyiv and hinder Putin's war aims in Ukraine.
With today's announcement, my administration has nearly exhausted funding that can be used to send security assistance through drawdown authorities for Ukraine. For Ukraine to succeed in this next phase of war its international partners, including the U.S., must continue to demonstrate our unity and our resolve to keep the weapons and ammunition flowing to Ukraine, without interruption. Congress should quickly provide the requested funding to strengthen Ukraine on the battlefield and at the negotiating table.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-additional-united-states-security-assistance-ukraine
Joe Biden,"May 06, 2022",Statement on the Bureau of Labor Statistics Report on the Employment Situation in April,"Today we learned that the economy created 428,000 jobs in April, bringing the total number of jobs created since I took office to 8.3 million: record-setting job creation in my first 15 months in office. Our plans and policies have produced the strongest job-creation economy in modern times. The unemployment rate now stands at 3.6 percent, the fastest decline in unemployment to start a President's term ever recorded. There have been only 3 months in the last 50 years where the unemployment rate in America is lower than it is now. This is a direct result of the American Rescue Plan, our COVID vaccination program, and my plan to grow our economy from the bottom up and middle out. When I took office, there were around 20 million people relying on unemployment benefits to feed their families; today, that number is around 1 million, the lowest since 1970. We are building an economy that values the dignity of work.
There's no question that inflation and high prices are a challenge for families across the country, and fighting inflation is a top priority for me. The continued strength of our job market and the savings that families have built up over the last year means that our economy faces the challenges of COVID-19, Putin's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, and global inflation from a position of strength. There's more work to do. I encourage congressional Republicans to join us in our efforts to lower prices for families across the country, by making more in America, strengthening our supply chains, and cutting the energy and prescription drug costs.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-the-bureau-labor-statistics-report-the-employment-situation-april
Joe Biden,"May 08, 2022",Joint Statement—Group of Seven (G-7) Nations Leaders' Statement,"1. Today, on 8 May, we, the Leaders of the Group of Seven (G7), alongside Ukraine and the wider global community, commemorate the end of the Second World War in Europe and the liberation from fascism and the National Socialist reign of terror, which caused immeasurable destruction, unspeakable horrors and human suffering. We mourn the millions of victims and offer our respect, especially to all those who paid the ultimate price to defeat the National Socialist regime, including the western Allies and the Soviet Union.
2. Seventy-seven years later, President Putin and his regime now chose to invade Ukraine in an unprovoked war of aggression against a sovereign country. His actions bring shame on Russia and the historic sacrifices of its people. Through its invasion of and actions in Ukraine since 2014, Russia has violated the international rules-based order, particularly the UN Charter, conceived after the Second World War to spare successive generations from the scourge of war.
3. Today, we were honoured to be joined by Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. We assured him of our full solidarity and support for Ukraine's courageous defence of its sovereignty and territorial integrity, and its fight for a peaceful, prosperous and democratic future within its internationally recognised borders, with the liberties and freedoms that so many of us enjoy today.
4. President Zelenskyy underlined the strong resolve of Ukraine to protect its sovereignty and territorial integrity. He stated that Ukraine's ultimate aim is to ensure full withdrawal of Russia's military forces and equipment from the entire territory of Ukraine and to secure its ability to protect itself in the future and thanked G7 members for their support. In this regard, Ukraine emphasised that it relies on its international partners, in particular on G7 members, in providing necessary assistance in the domain of defense capabilities, as well as with a view to ensuring a swift and effective recovery of Ukraine's economy and to securing its economic and energy security. Ukraine has entered into discussions with international partners on security mechanisms for a viable post-war peace settlement. Ukraine remains committed to working closely with G7 members to support Ukraine's macroeconomic stability in the face of the challenges posed by the full-scaled Russian invasion, massive destruction of critical infrastructure and disruption of traditional shipping routes for Ukrainian exports. President Zelenskyy noted his country's commitment to uphold our common democratic values and principles, including respect for human rights and the rule of law.
5. Today, we, the G7, reassured President Zelenskyy of our continued readiness to undertake further commitments to help Ukraine secure its free and democratic future, such that Ukraine can defend itself now and deter future acts of aggression. To this end, we will pursue our ongoing military and defence assistance to the Ukrainian Armed Forces, continue supporting Ukraine in defending its networks against cyber incidents, and expand our cooperation, including on information security. We will continue to support Ukraine in increasing its economic and energy security.
6. Together with the international community, we, the G7, have provided and pledged additional support since the start of the war exceeding USD 24 billion for 2022 and beyond, in both financial and material means. In the coming weeks, we will step up our collective short-term financial support to help Ukraine close financing gaps and deliver basic services to its people, while also developing options—working with the Ukrainian authorities and international financial institutions—to support long-term recovery and reconstruction. In this regard, we welcome the establishment of the International Monetary Fund's Multi-Donor Administered Account for Ukraine and the European Union announcement to develop a Ukraine Solidarity Trust Fund. We support the World Bank Group's support package to Ukraine and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development's Resilience Package.
7. We call on all partners to join our support for the Ukrainian people and for refugees, and to help Ukraine to rebuild its future.
8. We reiterate our condemnation of Russia's unprovoked, unjustifiable and illegal military aggression against Ukraine and the indiscriminate attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure, which has resulted in terrible humanitarian catastrophe in the heart of Europe. We are appalled by the large-scale loss of human life, assault on human rights, and destruction that Russia's actions have inflicted on Ukraine.
9. Under no circumstances can civilians and those not taking an active part in the hostilities be legitimate targets. We will spare no effort to hold President Putin and the architects and accomplices of this aggression, including the Lukashenko regime in Belarus, accountable for their actions in accordance with international law. To this end, we will continue to work together, along with our allies and partners around the world. We reaffirm our support for all efforts to ensure full accountability. We welcome and support the ongoing work to investigate and gather evidence on this, including by the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, the independent investigation commission mandated by the United Nations Human Rights Council and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe's mission of experts.
10. We further condemn Russia's attempts to replace democratically elected Ukrainian local authorities with illegitimate ones. We will not recognise these acts in violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.
11. We will continue to counter the Russian strategy of disinformation, which deliberately manipulates the global—including the Russian—public in the hope of shrouding the Russian regime's culpability for this war.
12. Our unprecedented package of coordinated sanctions has already significantly hindered Russia's war of aggression by limiting access to financial channels and ability to pursue their objectives. These restrictive measures are already having a significant impact on all Russian economic sectors—financial, trade, defence, technology, and energy—and will intensify pressure on Russia over time. We will continue to impose severe and immediate economic costs on President Putin's regime for this unjustifiable war. We collectively commit to taking the following measures, consistent with our respective legal authorities and processes:
a. First, we commit to phase out our dependency on Russian energy, including by phasing out or banning the import of Russian oil. We will ensure that we do so in a timely and orderly fashion, and in ways that provide time for the world to secure alternative supplies. As we do so, we will work together and with our partners to ensure stable and sustainable global energy supplies and affordable prices for consumers, including by accelerating reduction of our overall reliance on fossil fuels and our transition to clean energy in accordance with our climate objectives.
b. Second, we will take measures to prohibit or otherwise prevent the provision of key services on which Russia depends. This will reinforce Russia's isolation across all sectors of its economy.
c. Third, we will continue to take action against Russian banks connected to the global economy and systemically critical to the Russian financial system. We have already severely impaired Russia's ability to finance its war of aggression by targeting its Central Bank and its largest financial institutions.
d. Fourth, we will continue our efforts to fight off the Russian regime's attempts to spread its propaganda. Respectable private companies should not provide revenue to the Russian regime or to its affiliates feeding the Russian war machine.
e. Fifth, we will continue and elevate our campaign against the financial elites and family members, who support President Putin in his war effort and squander the resources of the Russian people. Consistent with our national authorities, we will impose sanctions on additional individuals.

13. We continue to work with our international partners and invite them to stand with us and to follow suit with similar actions, including to prevent sanctions evasion, circumvention and backfilling.
14. President Putin's war is causing global economic disruptions, impacting the security of global energy supply, fertiliser and food provision, and the functioning of global supply chains in general. The most vulnerable countries are affected most severely. Together with partners globally, we are stepping up our efforts to counter these adverse and harmful impacts of this war.
15. President Putin's war against Ukraine is placing global food security under severe strain. Together with the United Nations, we call on Russia to end its blockade and all other activities that further impede Ukrainian food production and exports, in line with its international commitments. Failure to do so will be seen as an attack on feeding the world. We will step up efforts to help Ukraine to keep producing in view of the next harvest season and exporting, including by alternative routes.
16. In support of the United Nations Global Crises Response Group, we will address the causes and consequences of the global food crisis through a Global Alliance for Food Security, as our joint initiative to ensure momentum and coordination, and other efforts. We will closely cooperate with international partners and organisations beyond the G7, and, with the aim of transforming political commitments into concrete actions as planned by various international initiatives such as the Food and Agriculture Resilience Mission (FARM) and key regional outreach initiatives, including towards African and Mediterranean countries. We reiterate that our sanctions packages are carefully targeted so as not to impede the delivery of humanitarian assistance or the trade of agricultural products and reaffirm our commitment to avoid food export restrictions which impact the most vulnerable.
17. The G7 and Ukraine stand united in this difficult time and in their quest to ensure Ukraine's democratic, prosperous future. We remain united in our resolve that President Putin must not win his war against Ukraine. We owe it to the memory of all those who fought for freedom in the Second World War, to continue fighting for it today, for the people of Ukraine, Europe and the global community.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/joint-statement-group-seven-g-7-nations-leaders-statement
Joe Biden,"May 09, 2022",Statement on Legislation To Fund Ukraine Assistance and COVID-19 Prevention and Treatment Efforts,"Ten days ago, I sent to Congress an urgent proposal to provide needed military, economic, and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine. The plan was substantial in size, because the need is substantial: We must stand by Ukraine as it defends itself from Russian aggression.
The need is also urgent. I have nearly exhausted the resources given to me by a bipartisan majority in Congress to support Ukraine's fighters. This aid has been critical to Ukraine's success on the battlefield. We cannot allow our shipments of assistance to stop while we await further Congressional action. We are approximately 10 days from hitting this critical deadline.
I am pleased that, in my conversations with Congressional leaders, there appears to be strong support for the proposal I submitted, and Congress is likely to pass it in substantially the form I proposed. I urge them to do so, and again, I urge them to do so quickly.
Previously, I had recommended that Congress take overdue action on much needed funding for COVID treatments, vaccines, and tests, as part of the Ukraine supplemental bill. However, I have been informed by Congressional leaders in both parties that such an addition would slow down action on the urgently needed Ukrainian aid, a view expressed strongly by several congressional Republicans. We cannot afford delay in this vital war effort. Hence, I am prepared to accept that these two measures move separately so that the Ukrainian aid bill can get to my desk right away.
However, let me be clear. As vital as it is to help Ukraine combat Russian aggression, it is equally vital to help Americans combat COVID. Without timely COVID funding, more Americans will die needlessly. We will lose our place in line for America to order new COVID treatments and vaccines for the fall, including next-generation vaccines under development, and be unable to maintain our supply of COVID tests. In the fall, if we are hit by new variants, it will be too late to get the tools needed for protection, critical treatments that will be available in Europe, but not the United States. In addition, our effort to help lower income countries get COVID vaccines into arms will stall.
So I call on Congress to pass the Ukrainian supplemental funding bill immediately and get it to my desk in the next few days. And then, I urge Congress to move promptly on the COVID funding bill. This virus knows no borders; we must continue to save lives here at home and around the world.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-legislation-fund-ukraine-assistance-and-covid-19-prevention-and-treatment

REAFFIRMING our shared commitment to strengthen and build more comprehensive ASEAN-U.S. Dialogue Relations, which have long been indispensable to ASEAN and the United States, as well as the broader region and the international community, in order to continue promoting and maintaining peace, security, stability and prosperity in the region; to ensure that relations remain adaptable to meet new challenges; and to appropriately cooperate in international and regional fora of which ASEAN Member States and the United States are members.
FURTHER REAFFIRMING our shared commitment to maintaining and promoting peace, security and stability in the region, as well as to the peaceful resolution of disputes, including full respect for legal and diplomatic processes, without resorting to the threat or use of force, in accordance with international law.

We look forward to the early completion of the necessary process.
Fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, building better health security, and recovering together 
1. We support ASEAN's pandemic recovery and health security efforts by strengthening regional and national health systems and capabilities, such as through the ASEAN-U.S. Health Futures initiative, and commit to adequate, stronger and sustainable global financing for pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response, including supporting ongoing efforts with the World Bank and the World Health Organization. In welcoming support extended by ASEAN Dialogue Partners through various initiatives, including the Quad Vaccine Partnership, we remain committed to facilitating equitable access to safe, affordable and quality medicine and health services. We are also committed to expanding local and regional sustainable manufacturing capacity of essential medical products, including through transfer of knowledge on voluntary and mutually agreed terms and provision of technical assistance. We are committed to investing in and strengthening health systems through Universal Health Coverage, in particular primary health care and access to essential health services, and expanding and training the health workforce as strong foundations for regional and global health and health security.
Strengthening Economic Ties and Connectivity 
2. We are committed to continuing to advance stronger, more equitable, more inclusive economic growth and sustainable development, including through the implementation of the ASEAN-U.S. Trade and Investment Framework Arrangement and Expanded Economic Engagement Initiatives Workplan, and through the vital economic participation of the U.S. in the region.
3. We are committed to working to meet the region's infrastructure needs by catalyzing investment in high-standard, transparent, low-carbon and climate-resilient infrastructure projects that advance inclusive and sustainable economic growth that meet applicable international labor standards and environmental protections.
4. We are committed to continuing to cooperate to promote trade and investment and facilitating resilient global supply chains and seamless regional connectivity, including for essential goods such as medical supplies, medicines, vaccines, food and agricultural products, commodities, high-tech products, and other essential supplies and services, contributing to sustainable economic recovery and resilience in the region.
5. We seek to deepen our collaboration on transport connectivity, including air, land, maritime, and transport facilitation program to advance sustainable infrastructure development and support emerging technologies, including electric vehicles.
6. We remain committed to and invested in prosperity and development in ASEAN and the United States. We will actively partner in the discussions to strengthen regional and global governance systems, and we look forward to further strengthening cooperation including through relevant initiatives or frameworks of the United States or ASEAN.
7. We are committed to improving cybersecurity capabilities, promoting digital literacy and inclusion, and strengthening frameworks and policies that foster efficiency, innovation, communication, safe and equitable use of the internet and economic prosperity while exchanging views and experiences on cyber threats and on regulatory framework and technical standards that protect personal data in light of emerging technologies and their vulnerabilities.
Promoting Maritime Cooperation 
8. We note the United Nations General Assembly Resolution A/RES/75/239 emphasizing in the Preamble, the universal and unified character of the 1982 UNCLOS, and reaffirming that the Convention sets out the legal framework within which all activities in the oceans and seas must be carried out and is of strategic importance as the basis for national, regional and global action and cooperation in the marine sector, and that its integrity needs to be maintained.
9. We are committed to advancing our cooperation in the maritime domain through ASEAN-led mechanisms. We plan to forge new ties as well as to promote cooperation and coordination among our relevant agencies, including maritime law enforcement agencies, to collaborate to improve maritime domain awareness, search and rescue, maritime security, and to curb illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing through sharing of information, best practices and expertise, as well as technical assistance, which will complement, and not duplicate the existing mechanisms.

Joe Biden,"May 23, 2022","Joint Statement by President Biden, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of Australia, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, and Prime Minister Fumio Kishida of Japan on the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue Leader's Summit in Tokyo, Japan","Today, we—Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of Australia, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida of Japan, and President Joe Biden of the United States—convene in Tokyo to renew our steadfast commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific that is inclusive and resilient.
Just over one year ago, Leaders met for the first time. Today in Tokyo, we convene for our fourth meeting, and our second in person, to demonstrate, at a time of profound global challenge, that the Quad is a force for good, committed to bringing tangible benefits to the region. In our first year of cooperation, we established the Quad's dedication to a positive and practical agenda; in our second year, we are committed to deliver on this promise, making the region more resilient for the 21st century.
With the COVID-19 pandemic still inflicting human and economic pain around the world, tendencies for unilateral actions among states and a tragic conflict raging in Ukraine, we are steadfast. We strongly support the principles of freedom, rule of law, democratic values, sovereignty and territorial integrity, peaceful settlement of disputes without resorting to threat or use of force, any unilateral attempt to change the status quo, and freedom of navigation and overflight, all of which are essential to the peace, stability and prosperity of the Indo-Pacific region and to the world. We will continue to act decisively together to advance these principles in the region and beyond. We reaffirm our resolve to uphold the international rules-based order where countries are free from all forms of military, economic and political coercion.
Peace and Stability 
We discussed our respective responses to the conflict in Ukraine and the ongoing tragic humanitarian crisis, and assessed its implications for the Indo-Pacific. Quad Leaders reiterated our strong resolve to maintain the peace and stability in the region. We underscored unequivocally that the centerpiece of the international order is international law, including the UN Charter, respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity of all states. We also emphasized that all countries must seek peaceful resolution of disputes in accordance with international law.
The Quad is committed to cooperation with partners in the region who share the vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific. We reaffirm our unwavering support for ASEAN unity and centrality and for the practical implementation of ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific. We welcome the EU's Joint Communication on the EU Strategy for Cooperation in the Indo-Pacific which was announced in September 2021 and increased European engagement in the Indo-Pacific region. We will champion adherence to international law, particularly as reflected in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), and the maintenance of freedom of navigation and overflight, to meet challenges to the maritime rules-based order, including in the East and South China Seas. We strongly oppose any coercive, provocative or unilateral actions that seek to change the status quo and increase tensions in the area, such as the militarization of disputed features, the dangerous use of coast guard vessels and maritime militia, and efforts to disrupt other countries' offshore resource exploitation activities.
Individually and collectively, we will further strengthen our cooperation with Pacific island countries, to enhance their economic well being, strengthen health infrastructure and environmental resilience, to improve their maritime security and sustain their fisheries, to provide sustainable infrastructure, to bolster educational opportunities, and to mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change, which pose especially serious challenges for this region. We are committed to working together to address the needs of Pacific island partners. We reaffirmed our support for Pacific Islands Forum unity and for Pacific regional security frameworks.
Among ourselves and with our partners, we will deepen our cooperation in multilateral institutions, including at the United Nations, where reinforcing our shared priorities to reform and enhance the resilience of the multilateral system itself. Individually and together, we will respond to the challenges of our time, ensuring that the region remains inclusive, open, and governed by universal rules and norms.
We reaffirm our commitment to the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, consistent with United Nations Security Council Resolutions (UNSCRs) and also reconfirm the necessity of immediate resolution of the issue of Japanese abductees. We also condemn North Korea's destabilizing ballistic missile development and launches, including multiple intercontinental ballistic missile tests, in violation of UNSCRs, and call on the international community to fully implement these resolutions. We urge North Korea to abide by all of its obligations under the UNSCRs, refrain from provocations, and engage in substantive dialogue.
We remain deeply concerned by the crisis in Myanmar, which has caused grave humanitarian suffering and posed challenges to regional stability. We continue to call for the immediate end to violence in Myanmar, the release of all political detainees, including foreigners, engagement in constructive dialogue, humanitarian access, and the swift restoration of democracy. We reaffirm our support for ASEAN-led efforts to seek a solution in Myanmar and welcome the role of Special Envoy of the ASEAN Chair. We further call for the urgent implementation of the ASEAN Five Point Consensus.
We condemn unequivocally terrorism and violent extremism in all its forms and manifestations and reiterate that there can be no justification for acts of terror on any grounds whatsoever. We denounce the use of terrorist proxies and emphasize the importance of denying any logistical, financial or military support to terrorist groups which could be used to launch or plan terror attacks, including cross-border attacks. We reiterate our condemnation of terrorist attacks, including 26/11 Mumbai and Pathankot attacks. We also reaffirm UNSC Resolution 2593 (2021), which demands that Afghan territory must never again be used to threaten or attack any country or to shelter or train terrorists, or to plan or finance terrorist attacks. We emphasize the importance of upholding international standards on anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism by all countries, consistent with FATF recommendations. We reaffirm that in our fight against global terrorism, we will take concerted action against all terrorist groups, including those individuals and entities designated pursuant to the UNSC Resolution 1267(1999).
COVID-19 and Global Health Security 
For more than two years, the world has grappled with the devastating impacts of COVID-19—on our communities, citizens, health workers and systems and economies. The Quad countries have led and will continue to lead global efforts for COVID-19 response, with a view to building better health security and strengthening health systems. We commit to adapt our collective approaches to get ahead of the virus with a focus on preparing for new variants, and getting vaccines, tests, treatments, and other medical products to those at highest risk.
To date, the Quad partners have collectively pledged approximately USD $5.2 billion to the COVAX AMC, approximately 40 percent of the total contributions from government donors. We are proud to have delivered over 670 million doses, including at least 265 million doses to Indo-Pacific. Noting significant expansion in the global supply of COVID-19 vaccines, we will continue to share safe, effective, affordable and quality-assured COVID-19 vaccines where and when they are needed.
We welcome the progress on the expansion of J&J vaccine production at the Biological E facility in India under the Quad Vaccine Partnership—sustainable manufacturing capacity will yield long-term benefit in the fight against COVID-19 and future pandemics. In this regard, we look forward to the grant of WHO's EUL approvals regarding the aforementioned vaccines in India. We celebrate the donation by the Quad to Cambodia and Thailand of WHO approved Made in India vaccines, together with Quad members' other vaccine related support, as an example of tangible achievement of our collaboration.
We will continue to address both the COVID-19 response and preparedness against future health threats. We will accelerate getting shots in arms through last mile support of which over 2 billion USD has been provided in more than 115 countries globally by our four countries, and will also address vaccine hesitancy through a Quad-convened event this week at the World Health Assembly. We will coordinate our efforts including through the ""COVID-19 Prioritized Global Action Plan for Enhanced Engagement (GAP),"" and COVAX Vaccine Delivery Partnership. We welcome the successful 2nd Global COVID-19 Summit co-hosted by the United States, and joined by the Quad members, which galvanized $3.2 billion in financial and policy commitments. We will strengthen support for economic and social revitalization in the Indo-Pacific region.
In the long term, we will strengthen the global health architecture and pandemic prevention, preparedness and response (PPR) to build better health security, including by enhancing finance and health coordination and bolstering on-going science and technology cooperation, such as through clinical trials and genomic surveillance. Building on existing Quad collaboration, we will enhance our capacity to improve early detection and monitor new and emerging pathogens with pandemic potential, and work to increase resilience to epidemics and pandemics. For the development of new vaccines to prevent and contain infectious diseases, Quad partners have collectively committed $524 million to the next phase of CEPI's work, accounting for about 50 percent of the total public investors.
We commit, as members of the Group of Friends of UHC, to take global leadership to further strengthen and reform the global health architecture for enhancing PPR and promoting UHC in the lead up to the UN High Level Meeting on UHC to be held in 2023.
Infrastructure 
We reaffirmed our shared commitment to deepen cooperation on infrastructure, which is critical to driving productivity and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region. We also share a commitment to addressing debt issues, which have been exacerbated by the pandemic in many countries.
Quad partners bring decades of skills and experience together to catalyse infrastructure delivery to the region. We are committed to working closely with partners and the region to drive public and private investment to bridge gaps. To achieve this, Quad will seek to extend more than 50 billion USD of infrastructure assistance and investment in the Indo-Pacific, over the next five years.
We will work to strengthen capacities of the countries in need to cope with debt issues under the G20 Common Framework and by promoting debt sustainability and transparency in close collaboration with finance authorities of relevant countries, including through the ""Quad Debt Management Resource Portal,"" which consists of multiple bilateral and multilateral capacity building assistance.
We also welcome the meeting of the development finance institutions and agencies of the four countries in the margins of the Quad Leaders' Meeting. We are working closely with experts, our region and each other to link our toolkits and expertise to better connect the Indo-Pacific.
We will further deepen collaboration and pursue complementary actions in identified areas, such as regional and digital connectivity, clean energy, and climate resilience including disaster resilience in energy related facilities that reflect the region's priorities including ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific, to contribute to sustainable and inclusive growth in the region.
Climate 
Recognizing the urgent need to address climate change as emphasized in the latest IPCC reports, we will steadfastly implement the Paris Agreement and deliver on the outcomes of COP26, accelerating our efforts to raise global ambition, including reaching out to key stakeholders in the Indo-Pacific region and supporting, strengthening, and enhancing climate actions by partners in the region including through mobilizing climate finance, both public and private, and facilitating the research, development, and deployment of innovative technology.
Today, we launch the ""Quad Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation Package (Q-CHAMP)"" with ""mitigation"" and ""adaptation"" as its two themes. Q-CHAMP includes ongoing activities under the Quad Climate Working Group on: green shipping and ports aiming for a shared green corridor framework building on each Quad country's input; clean energy cooperation in clean hydrogen and methane emissions from the natural gas sector; strengthening clean energy supply chains, welcoming the contribution of the Sydney Energy Forum; climate information services for developing an engagement strategy with Pacific island countries; and disaster risk reduction, including disaster and climate resilient infrastructure such as the efforts through the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI). Its coverage includes new cooperation in clean fuel ammonia, CCUS/Carbon Recycling, cooperation and capacity building support to advance high integrity carbon markets under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, climate-smart agriculture, knowledge sharing on subnational climate actions, and ecosystem-based adaptation. To make Q-CHAMP tangible, we are committed to expanding our programs, in support of climate actions between our four countries as well as in the Indo-Pacific region. We recognize the immense challenges posed by climate change to the island nations of the Pacific.
We welcome the new Australian Government's commitment to stronger action on climate change, including through passing legislation to achieve net zero by 2050 and lodging a new, ambitious Nationally Determined Contribution.
Cybersecurity 
In an increasingly digital world with sophisticated cyber threats we recognize an urgent need to take a collective approach to enhancing cybersecurity. To deliver on the Quad Leaders' vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific, we commit to improving the defense of our nations' critical infrastructure by sharing threat information, identifying and evaluating potential risks in supply chains for digitally enabled products and services, and aligning baseline software security standards for government procurement, leveraging our collective purchasing power to improve the broader software development ecosystem so that all users can benefit. The Quad partners will coordinate capacity building programs in the Indo-Pacific region under the Quad Cybersecurity Partnership, and will initiate the first-ever Quad Cybersecurity Day to help individual internet users across our nations, the Indo-Pacific region, and beyond to better protect themselves from cyber threats.
Critical & Emerging Technologies 
The Quad remains focused on harnessing critical and emerging technologies to enhance the prosperity and security of the region. In the area of 5G and beyond 5G, while welcoming the Prague Proposals on Telecommunications Supplier Diversity, we will advance interoperability and security through the signature of a new Memorandum of Cooperation on 5G Supplier Diversification and Open RAN. We are also deepening our engagement with industry, including through Open RAN Track 1.5 events, and exploring ways to collaborate on the deployment of open and secure telecommunications technologies in the region.
We have mapped the Quad's capacity and vulnerabilities in global semiconductor supply chains and have decided to better leverage our complementary strengths to realize a diverse and competitive market for semiconductors. The Common Statement of Principles on Critical Technology Supply Chains, launched on the occasion of this Summit, advances our cooperation on semiconductors and other critical technologies, providing a cooperative foundation for enhancing our resilience against various risks to the region. Our cooperation in the international standardization organizations, such as the Telecommunication Standardization Bureau of the International Telecommunication Union, has made great progress, and we expect to strengthen such cooperation through the new International Standards Cooperation Network (ISCN). This cooperation will help ensure technology development in the region is guided by our shared democratic values. We continue to strengthen our horizon scanning cooperation following our deepened discussions in biotechnology through our efforts on mapping and a corresponding Track 1.5 and a future focus on quantum technologies. We will convene a business and investment forum for networking with industry partners to expand capital for critical and emerging technologies.
Quad Fellowship 
We recognize that people to people ties are the bedrock of the Quad and welcome the official launch of the Quad Fellowship, which is now open for application. The Quad Fellowship will bring 100 students from our countries to the United States each year to pursue graduate degrees in STEM fields, and is administered by Schmidt Futures. The first class of Quad Fellows will begin their studies in the third quarter of 2023, and we look forward to building together a talented cohort of next-generation STEM minds who will lead our countries in cutting-edge research and innovation.
Space 
Space-related applications and technologies can also contribute to addressing common challenges such as climate change, disaster preparedness and response, and sustainable uses of oceans and marine resources. Each Quad partner will endeavor to improve public access to Earth observation satellite data and applications. We will work together to create an Earth observation-based monitoring and sustainable development framework. We will endeavor to share space-based civil Earth observation data, along with providing a ""Quad Satellite Data Portal"" that aggregates links to our respective national satellite data resources. We will work together to develop space applications, including in the area of Earth observations, and provide capacity building support to countries in the region, including with regards to partnering on using space capabilities to respond to extreme precipitation events. We will also consult on rules, norms, guidelines and principles for the sustainable use of space, and extend support to countries in the region through joint workshops including in relation to the UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) Guidelines for the Long-Term Sustainability of Outer Space Activities.
Maritime Domain Awareness and HADR 
We welcome a new maritime domain awareness initiative, the Indo-Pacific Partnership for Maritime Domain Awareness (IPMDA), designed to work with regional partners to respond to humanitarian and natural disasters, and combat illegal fishing. IPMDA will support and work in consultation with Indo-Pacific nations and regional information fusion centers in the Indian Ocean, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands by providing technology and training to support enhanced, shared maritime domain awareness to promote stability and prosperity in our seas and oceans. IPMDA embodies what the Quad stands for: catalyzing our joint efforts towards concrete results that help to make the region more stable and prosperous.

Joe Biden,"May 31, 2022","Joint Statement by President Biden and Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern of Aotearoa New Zealand—A 21st-Century Partnership for the Pacific, the Indo-Pacific, and the World","President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. is honored to welcome Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern of Aotearoa New Zealand to the White House. The leaders reaffirmed the strategic partnership between the United States and New Zealand, as expressed in the 2010 Wellington Declaration and the 2012 Washington Declaration.
Our peoples have served side-by-side to uphold international peace and security for over a century; 80 years ago, during the Second World War, U.S. Marines arrived in New Zealand before embarking for the Pacific theatre. Together we honor that history of shared resolve in the face of aggression, in the pursuit of peace, and in our common respect for sovereignty, territorial integrity, and the peaceful resolution of disputes. We note that, since then, our ties have broadened and deepened, founded on shared values of democracy, fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law. Today, President Biden and Prime Minister Ardern committed to advance our longstanding partnership to meet 21st-century challenges: bolstering security and building resilience, including to climate change, in the Pacific; promoting prosperity in the Indo-Pacific; and combatting the climate crisis and ensuring the responsible use of technology around the world.
We meet at a time of great challenge. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to wreak a human and economic toll, even as the climate crisis becomes ever more urgent. Technology brings both opportunity and threat, including the scourge of online radicalization to violence. The rules-based international order that has long been the foundation of peace and prosperity is under pressure. In the Indo-Pacific, we face a challenging landscape, where the values, norms, and rules that have fostered stability, growth, and prosperity in recent decades are under threat. In Europe, meanwhile, Russia continues to wage its unjustified and unprovoked war in Ukraine. Taken together, these challenges call for common purpose and action, across the Atlantic and the Pacific.
I. Regional Architecture and Security 
Our partnership is global, but it is centered in the Indo-Pacific. The United States and New Zealand are committed to realizing a region of sovereign, resilient, and prosperous states, based on the international rules-based order, where states, including and especially small states, can pursue their interests free from coercion. This vision is reflected in the Indo-Pacific Strategy of the United States, which New Zealand welcomes; and in New Zealand's Indo-Pacific policy as outlined by Prime Minister Ardern in 2021.
The United States and New Zealand share a strong commitment to the regional architecture. We jointly recognize the importance of a strong and unified Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to an open, inclusive, stable, and prosperous Indo-Pacific. We reaffirm our strong support for ASEAN centrality and the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific. We value the Pacific Islands Forum, of which New Zealand is a member and the United States is a Forum Dialogue Partner, as the preeminent political regional body and a critical driver of Pacific regional cooperation, security, and stability. We appreciate that the Quad—the grouping of Australia, Japan, India, and the United States—plays an important role in delivering practical support to the region, including providing COVID-19 vaccines and improving maritime domain awareness. We note the shared commitment among New Zealand and AUKUS partners to the peace and stability of the Indo-Pacific region, and to upholding the international rules-based order.
We reaffirm our steadfast commitment to the Pacific Islands region, with a strong and united Pacific Islands Forum at the center. Prime Minister Ardern welcomed the United States' decision to heighten its engagement with this vital region, reflected in its recent appointment of a Special Presidential Envoy for Compact Negotiations and its commitments to expand its physical diplomatic presence across the Pacific. President Biden resolved to raise U.S. ambition in partnering with the Pacific Islands still higher and to match that ambition with resourcing.
Throughout our engagement, the United States and New Zealand will continue to support the Pacific region's own priorities, which will be reflected in the Forum's upcoming 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent. At the top of this agenda is addressing the climate crisis, which, as the Pacific Islands Forum's Boe Declaration states, is the single greatest threat to the Pacific and the health and well-being of its residents. New Zealand and the United States also affirmed their commitment to an approach to Pacific fisheries that is led by Pacific countries, protecting the marine environment, livelihoods, traditions, food security, and economic benefits.
Our countries will expand our work in the Pacific on infrastructure, including transportation and information-communications technology; cyber security; maritime security, including combatting illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing; education and skills training; COVID-19 pandemic assistance and global health security; and economic recovery. At the same time, we will promote democratic governance, free and fair elections, media freedom, and transparency; we will increase respect for human rights and the rule of law, and expand access to justice in Pacific countries, including through a new joint program to bolster the role of women in the justice sector. To best deliver these and other commitments in the Pacific, President Biden and Prime Minister Ardern committed to deepen coordination between the United States and New Zealand, and with other likeminded allies and partners, as we work together in support of Pacific priorities.
We are concerned with growing strategic competition in the Pacific region, which threatens to undermine existing institutions and arrangements that underpin the region's security. The United States acknowledged that Pacific Islands Forum Members have a strong commitment to support one another to meet the broader ambitions for the region's security, as set out in the Biketawa Declaration and Boe Declaration. We recognize that Pacific Islands Forum Members have worked hard together to meet one another's security needs, and today have the capacity and commitment to continue doing so. In this regard, we note with concern the security agreement between the People's Republic of China and the Solomon Islands. In particular, the United States and New Zealand share a concern that the establishment of a persistent military presence in the Pacific by a state that does not share our values or security interests would fundamentally alter the strategic balance of the region and pose national-security concerns to both our countries.
A freer and more open Indo-Pacific depends on preserving the international rules-based order in the maritime domain. To that end, we reaffirm our support for freedom of navigation and overflight, in the South China Sea and beyond, in accordance with the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). We oppose unlawful maritime claims and activities in the South China Sea that run counter to the rules-based international order, particularly UNCLOS. We reiterate our grave concerns regarding the human-rights violations in Xinjiang, and the erosion of rights and freedoms in Hong Kong, which undermines the high degree of autonomy enshrined in the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law. We underscore the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and encourage the peaceful resolution of cross-Strait issues.
We affirm our commitment to the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and urge the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) to abide by its obligations under United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions and return to negotiations. The leaders jointly condemn the DPRK's destabilizing ballistic missile tests this year, including multiple launches of intercontinental ballistic missiles, as clear violations of UNSC resolutions; they reaffirmed their commitment to work with the international community to address DPRK sanctions violations, including its illicit ship-to-ship transfers. We condemn the coup in Myanmar and the military's brutal attacks on civilians. We continue to call for the immediate cessation of violence, the release of all who are unjustly detained, unfettered countrywide humanitarian access, and a swift return to democracy.
Beyond the Indo-Pacific, the leaders strongly condemned Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine, which is in flagrant violation of international law. President Biden and Prime Minister Ardern discussed the financial and military support that both countries have provided to Ukraine, reviewed the ongoing application of sanctions our two countries have designed to deny the Kremlin the means to continue to prosecute its war in Ukraine, and considered what further measures could be taken to bolster the diplomatic effort. Alongside the European Union and international partners, our countries have condemned the campaign of disruptive and destructive cyber activity by Russia against Ukraine. And as food-exporting nations, we recognize the importance of ensuring that global supply chains for food and agricultural products remain free and open, and we are concerned by the severe impact of Russia's attacks on civilian infrastructure and its blockading of Ukraine's sea ports on global food security.
We highlight the importance of full implementation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and look forward to working together to achieve a meaningful outcome at the forthcoming Review Conference.
Today, we acknowledge that security and defense will become an ever-more-important focus of our strategic partnership. We look to increase the interoperability of our forces, including through personnel exchanges, co-deployments, and defense trade. Achieving this vision will require robust and sustained commitment to defense in the Pacific. As New Zealand takes delivery of new capabilities, we will look for opportunities for combined operations and to expand our cooperation in other ways. As the security environment in the Indo-Pacific evolves, so must our defense cooperation.
II. Indo-Pacific Prosperity 
The United States and New Zealand will deepen our economic ties, with each other and the region. Bilaterally, we intend to work together to promote growth in both our economies for the benefit of all our citizens, and to explore how we can expand bilateral trade and investment in order to strengthen the security of our supply chains and economic resilience. To that end, the United States and New Zealand will resume annual Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) discussions.
Regionally, the United States and New Zealand look forward to working together to progress the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF), alongside 12 other founding partners: Australia, Brunei, Fiji, India, Indonesia, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. President Biden and Prime Minister Ardern warmly welcomed Fiji's recent decision to join IPEF as a founding member—the first Pacific Island nation to do so.
We reiterate the value of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)—which New Zealand hosted in 2021 and the United States will host in 2023—as a forum for supporting trade and economic growth in the region in fulfilment of APEC Leaders' vision for an open, dynamic, resilient, and peaceful Asia-Pacific Community. We reaffirm our joint commitment to rationalize and phase out inefficient fossil-fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption, recalling the Glasgow Climate Pact and APEC Leaders' commitment to this goal. In doing so, we recognize that inefficient fossil-fuel subsidies distort markets, disadvantage renewable and clean energy, and undermine efforts to deal with the threat of climate change.
We intend to ensure that a free and open rules-based global trade system built on high standards and long-standing principles serves the interest of the citizens of both of our countries; to that end, we affirm our commitment to reform and strengthen the World Trade Organization (WTO), and to work together to secure outcomes that provide for meaningful disciplines at the upcoming 12th WTO Ministerial Conference.
III. 21st-Century Challenges 
Our deepening ties are vital to our ability to meet transnational challenges. Climate change poses an existential threat, in our countries and around the world, with the potential for devastating impacts in the Pacific region. We are urgently pursuing efforts toward net-zero emissions in our economies and limiting global average temperature rise to no more than 1.5 degrees, and commit to enhanced collaborative engagement on climate-change issues. We will work together to accelerate the uptake of the technologies, innovation, and investment needed for our transition to productive, sustainable, and inclusive low-emissions economies. We commit to producing plans to reduce methane emissions to support national and global efforts under the Global Methane Pledge. We will enhance our efforts to support an empowered low-emissions transition and to address climate impacts in the Pacific, including by supporting activities that build the resilience and adaptive capacity of small island developing states. We will also enhance our efforts to ensure the environmental integrity of carbon markets, and to ensure the mutual supportiveness of trade and climate policy.
As maritime democracies, we will cooperate on ocean governance. We will work together on protection and sustainable use of the ocean; decarbonizing the shipping sector, including by supporting the establishment of green-shipping corridors; and promoting maritime security, including by combatting challenges such as illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing. We also intend to work together on complementary approaches to achieve the objective of protecting maritime zones from challenge in the face of sea-level rise, through continued dialogue between law-of-the-sea experts. Noting our longstanding and shared interest in protecting Antarctica as a place for peace and science, and our decades of research collaboration, we reaffirm our commitment to the principles and the letter of the Antarctic Treaty system.
President Biden and Prime Minister Ardern committed to helping end the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic while also working to prevent, detect, prepare for, and respond to future global health emergencies and pandemic threats. With key partners, the United States and New Zealand have delivered more than 200 million life-saving doses of vaccine to the Indo-Pacific region, and we continue our efforts to address new phases of the pandemic. We will accelerate progress on immunization and increase access to testing, therapeutics, oxygen, and other lifesaving measures to prevent hospitalizations and deaths. Both leaders commended the commitments made at the recent Global COVID-19 Summit. In addition to supporting the ongoing work of the World Health Organization and the ACT-Accelerator, Prime Minister Ardern committed to support in-principle the establishment of a global health security fund for pandemic preparedness and response. Both leaders also reaffirmed their strong support for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, including as an ACT-Accelerator partner, and its Seventh Replenishment later this year. We affirm the importance of strengthening the resilience and responsiveness of the global health architecture, and are committed to negotiations underway on a new instrument to strengthen pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response, with a strengthened World Health Organization able to fulfill its central and coordinating role in international health work. They are also committed to working together to improve elements of the existing system, such as the International Health Regulations.
We must also address the virus of hate, online and offline. The leaders emphasized the need to take action to keep our people safe from gun violence. The Prime Minister expressed her personal condolences to President Biden and to the American people for the tragedies in Uvalde, Texas and Buffalo, New York.
In the face of online radicalization to violence, we share a commitment to work together to ensure that technology is used in ways that promote and advance human rights. As supporters of the Christchurch Call, we pledge to continue our work alongside civil society and the technology sector to counter terrorist and violent extremist content online, including racially or ethnically motivated violent extremism, while promoting human rights online and a free, open, global, interoperable, reliable, and secure internet. We look forward to our countries participating in the Christchurch Call Leaders' Summit in September this year, during which we intend to announce new measures to better understand and address online radicalization by promoting algorithmic transparency and data access, designing and implementing evidence-based interventions, optimizing and closing loopholes in crisis response, and advancing innovation by drawing on multi-stakeholder partners.
Even as we address the dangers of misuse of technology, we are committed to working together to protect and amplify its benefits. As supporters of the Declaration for the Future of the Internet, and members of the Freedom Online Coalition, the Open Government Partnership, and the Global Partnership on AI, we commit to pursuing multi-stakeholder approaches to support an open, free, global, interoperable, reliable, and secure internet and the responsible and ethical use of emerging technology. We will continue to work together to build strategies and share best practices to counter disinformation and misinformation, the spread of which threatens our democratic values and institutions. We also recognize the need for a diverse cohort of young people to help us navigate a digitally enabled future in line with our shared values. We plan to look for training and placement opportunities in both New Zealand and the United States to support young practitioners in science and technology broadly, and to deepen our digital technology partnership.
Online and offline, we will advance the rights of all people in our societies, including women, minorities, and Indigenous peoples. We share a fervent commitment to gender equity and equality. We recognize that online harassment and abuse, particularly when targeted at women activists, journalists, and political figures, undermines the strength of democracies; Prime Minister Ardern committed New Zealand to join the Global Partnership for Action on Online Gender-Based Harassment and Abuse. We reaffirm our commitment to promoting human rights and democracy and countering corruption and authoritarianism globally, including through the Summit for Democracy Year of Action.
The two leaders committed to strengthening the U.S.-New Zealand strategic partnership across all areas of space cooperation. They welcomed the finalization of our bilateral Space Framework Agreement, which will facilitate future collaboration between the United States and New Zealand on the uses of outer space for peaceful purposes. They also looked forward to the initiation of joint feasibility studies under the Framework Agreement in support of space exploration.
For 80 years, our diplomatic relationship has benefited our countries, the region, and the world. But today's world demands new resolve and closer cooperation between us. The United States and Aotearoa New Zealand will strengthen our strategic partnership to meet the challenges of the 21st century, seize the opportunities of an interconnected economy, and work together to preserve the international rules-based system on which our security, prosperity, and sustainability depends. As they reaffirmed our countries' unique partnership, President Biden and Prime Minister Ardern recalled the words inscribed on the Marine Corps Memorial plaque in Wellington, New Zealand: ""To the people of New Zealand: If you ever need a friend, you have one.""",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/joint-statement-president-biden-and-prime-minister-jacinda-ardern-aotearoa-new-zealand
Joe Biden,"June 01, 2022",Statement on Additional United States Security Assistance to Ukraine,"The people of Ukraine continue to inspire the world with their courage and resolve as they fight bravely to defend their country and their democracy against Russian aggression. The United States will stand with our Ukrainian partners and continue to provide Ukraine with weapons and equipment to defend itself.
Today I am announcing a significant new security assistance package to provide timely and critical aid to the Ukrainian military. Thanks to the additional funding for Ukraine, passed with overwhelmingly bipartisan support in the U.S. Congress, the United States will be able to keep providing Ukraine with more of the weapons that they are using so effectively to repel Russian attacks. This new package will arm them with new capabilities and advanced weaponry, including HIMARS with battlefield munitions, to defend their territory from Russian advances. We will continue to lead the world in providing historic assistance to support Ukraine's fight for freedom.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-additional-united-states-security-assistance-ukraine-0
Joe Biden,"June 10, 2022",Statement on the Bureau of Labor Statistics Report on the Consumer Price Index for May,"Today's report underscores why I have made fighting inflation my top economic priority. While it is good to see critical ""core"" inflation moderating, it is not coming down as sharply and as quickly as we must see. Putin's price hike hit hard in May here and around the world: high gas prices at the pump, energy, and food prices accounted for around half of the monthly price increases, and gas pump prices are up by $2 a gallon in many places since Russian troops began to threaten Ukraine. Even as we continue our work to defend freedom in Ukraine, we must do more—and quickly—to get prices down here in the United States.
My administration will continue to do everything we can to lower prices for the American people. Congress must act urgently as well. I call on Congress to pass a bill to cut shipping costs this month and get it to my desk so we can lower the price of goods. And I call on Congress to pass legislation to cut costs for families like energy bills and prescription drugs. The deficit has come down more under my watch as President than at any time in history, but if Congress would pass tax reform to make the wealthiest Americans and big corporations pay their fair share, we could reduce this inflationary pressure even more. These are the most significant things Congress can do to help families now and complement the Federal Reserve's efforts to bring inflation down.
Prices at the pump are a major part of inflation, and the war in Ukraine is a major cause of that. The United States is on track to produce a record amount of oil next year, and I am working with the industry to accelerate this output. But it is also important that the oil and gas and refining industries in this country not use the challenge created by the war in Ukraine as a reason to make things worse for families with excessive profit taking or price hikes.
We all have work to do to get inflation down. What will not help is the plan by some Republicans in Congress to raise taxes on the middle class and working families. That would be a step in the wrong direction, and I strongly oppose it.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-the-bureau-labor-statistics-report-the-consumer-price-index-for-may
Joe Biden,"June 15, 2022",Statement on Additional United States Security Assistance to Ukraine,"This morning I spoke with President Zelenskyy to discuss Russia's brutal and ongoing war against Ukraine. I reaffirmed my commitment that the United States will stand by Ukraine as it defends its democracy and support its sovereignty and territorial integrity in the face of unprovoked Russian aggression.
I informed President Zelenskyy that the United States is providing another $1 billion in security assistance for Ukraine, including additional artillery and coastal defense weapons, as well as ammunition for the artillery and advanced rocket systems that the Ukrainians need to support their defensive operations in the Donbas. We also discussed Secretary Austin's efforts in Brussels today to coordinate additional international support for the Ukrainian Armed Forces.
We also remain committed to supporting the Ukrainian people whose lives have been ripped apart by this war. Today I am also announcing an additional $225 million in humanitarian assistance to help people inside Ukraine, including by supplying safe drinking water, critical medical supplies and health care, food, shelter, and cash for families to purchase essential items.
The bravery, resilience, and determination of the Ukrainian people continues to inspire the world. And the United States, together with our allies and partners, will not waver in our commitment to the Ukrainian people as they fight for their freedom.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-additional-united-states-security-assistance-ukraine-1
Joe Biden,"June 16, 2022",Interview with Josh Boak of the Associated Press,"BOAK: I wanted to thank you for taking the time to do this.
THE PRESIDENT: Sure, happy to.
BOAK: And I'm really interested in how you're thinking and how you're making choices during what seems like a really unique time in American history.
THE PRESIDENT: Well, I'm making choices. It's an interesting question. I'm making choices like I always have, in the sense that circumstances change but my objective doesn't change. Does that make sense to you? For example, I have, uh, from the time I've entered public life, it's been about how to give ordinary working-class and middle-class folks a shot (inaudible) .. instead of everything being viewed as from the top down. I'm not a big, is it working (a reference to the tape recorder).
BOAK: Yeah, we're good.
THE PRESIDENT: I'm not a big believer in trickle-down economy, and, um, and so everything I look at from the time I took this office, but even before that when I was a senator all those years, is what's the best shot to grow the economy from the bottom up and the middle out because when that happens everybody does well. The wealthy do very, very well. And the biggest thing I think that, when I came into this job, that I have the greatest frustration with the last four years, is that, um, uh, everything was constructed and built and arranged in order for the top 1 to 3% of the population to do very well. The rest was sort of, I mean that literally, everything else seemed to be an afterthought.
BOAK: So, let me ask about that, right, because you've seen the polls. There's a lot of voters who are very pessimistic. When I look at the consumer sentiment survey the University of Michigan puts out, even Democrats began to get really worried about a year ago regarding the economy and we've had people that have basically been through a pandemic, shortages of basic goods, inflation, some of the political divisions you're seeing right now on the Hill with the Jan. 6 hearings, and also a war in Europe. And how do you as a president provide a sense of stability and strength ... (crosstalk)
THE PRESIDENT: Well, if you notice, until gas prices started going up, which was about the same time, the University of Michigan survey, they had a very different view. Things were much more, they were much more optimistic. We came in and we started to grow the economy in significant ways. We were able to, ah, you know, go from 2 million shots in arms to 225 million. People were having access to dealing with the pandemic. We started opening up businesses, and opening up access to go back to work, etc. But then, in my experience, the way I was raised, if you want a direct barometer of what people are going to talk about at the kitchen table and the dining room table and whether things are going well, it's the cost of food and what's the cost of, of gasoline at the pump. I mean literally at the pump.
And if you notice, you know, uh, gasoline went up a, you know, $1.25 right off the bat, almost, when, the, Putin's war started. Um, and as I said at the time, by the way, I made it clear with helping Ukraine, and organizing NATO to help Ukraine, that this was going to cost. There was going to be a price to pay for it. It was, this is not going to be cost-free, but we had, the option of doing nothing was worse. If he in fact moved into Ukraine, took hold of Ukraine, and Belarus, where it is, and he's been a threat to NATO, all those things would have even been more dire.
BOAK: Why is that? Because it seems like you knew the risks on Ukraine with regard to higher gasoline prices ...
THE PRESIDENT: Sure.
BOAK: ... that carried political risks for you at home ...
THE PRESIDENT: Sure.
BOAK: ... so when, when your aides said, ""Look at the situation,"" how did you make that choice? What would you tell someone in Latrobe, Pennsylvania?
THE PRESIDENT: I'm the president of the United States. It's not about my political survival. It's about what's best for the country. No kidding. No kidding. So what happens? What happens if the strongest power, NATO, an organizational structure we put together, walked away from Russian aggression of over 100,000 troops marching across a border to try to, to occupy and wipe out a culture of an entire people. What, then, then what happens? What happens next? What do we do next?
BOAK: What did you fear would happen next if you didn't do?
THE PRESIDENT: Oh, I fear what would happen next is you'd see chaos in Europe. You would see the possibility they continue to move. You already saw what they're doing in Belarus. What would happen in the surrounding countries. Watch what would happen in Poland, and, and the Czech Republic and all the members of NATO. For example, you know, the reason Putin said he was going to go in was because he didn't want them to join NATO. And, uh, he, he, he, he wanted the sort of the Finland-ization of NATO. He got the NATO-ization of Finland, instead. (laughter) No, I'm serious.
BOAK: Yeah.
THE PRESIDENT: And so, the idea that if the United States stood by, then what does China think about Taiwan? Then what does North Korea think about nuclear weapons beyond testing and pressure?
BOAK: Do you think Americans have that sense of the stakes on a daily basis?
THE PRESIDENT: No, I don't. But I don't think, look, on a daily basis, most households just trying to figure out how to put, before, even when things were going well, just figure out how to put food on the table, take care of the kids, pay for their education, just basic things. You know, look, um, one of the, I've always suggested to younger people that want to get into public life, I ask them two things: Have you figured out what's worth losing over? Have you figured out what's worth losing over? If you haven't figured that out, don't get in politics. Go into a more profitable org, enterprise. Go into business, go into commerce, don't, be engaged. But unless you know what's worth losing over, don't get engaged. Number one. Number two. The purpose of public service is to promote views that you think are best for the American people.
I made a commitment and I think I can say that I've never broken, if I make a commitment. I wasn't going to run again, this time. I mean for real. I was not going to run. I just lost my son, I was teaching at Penn, I liked it, until all those guys came, come out of the woods ...
BOAK: Charlottesville.
THE PRESIDENT: ... the Charlottesville folks and this other guy said ""good people on both sides"" when an innocent woman was killed, etc. And, I made a decision. I've been doing this too long to do anything other than to try to do what was right. I mean, I'm not, there's nothing noble about it. But it's not worth it. So, you asked me what would I say to the American people. I'd say to the American people I've done foreign policy my whole career. I'm convinced that if we let Russia roll and Putin roll, he wouldn't stop.
BOAK: Let me ask on another hard choice you made. When you came into office, it seems as though you made the choice to prioritize job growth. Republicans right now are saying to voters that inflation started with your COVID relief package.
THE PRESIDENT: Zero evidence of that. Zero evidence of that, number one. Number two, we've reduced the deficit by $350 billion last year. We reduced the deficit by a trillion, 700 billion this year. We grow the economy. Today, today, we have more people employed than, in a long, long time and we gained another 8.6 million jobs. And guess what? We still have hundreds of thousands of job openings.
BOAK: So, so do you think that when Treasury Secretary Yellen said it might have made a marginal contribution to inflation that that was off? Did anyone apprise you (interrupted)
THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, they apprised me.
BOAK: of possible trade-offs?
THE PRESIDENT: Now you just said two different things. You said Republicans said I caused inflation. She said it may have a marginal impact on it. Two different things. You could argue whether it had a marginal, minor impact on inflation. I don't think it did. And most economists do not think it did. But the idea that it caused inflation is bizarre.
BOAK: Let me ask, stepping back, after yesterday's Fed meeting. I know that you've said: ""Look, our economy is strong. We have these jobs. It's the best look we've had in decades."" But then you've got serious economists who warn of a recession next year.
THE PRESIDENT: Sure.
BOAK: What should Americans believe?
THE PRESIDENT: They shouldn't believe a warning. They should just say: ""Let's see. Let's see, which is correct."" And from my perspective, you talked about a recession. First of all, it's not inevitable. Secondly, we're in a stronger position than any nation in the world to overcome this inflation. It's bad. Isn't it kind of interesting? If it's my fault, why is it the case in every other major industrial country in the world that inflation is higher? You ask yourself that? I'm not being a wise guy. Someone should ask themself that question. Why? Why is it? If it's a consequence of our spending, we've reduced the deficit. We've increased employment, increased pay. There was a survey done uh, uh, by the, uh, I forget which one it was, which one it was now, about three months ago. You had more people had lower debt (inaudible) credit cards, more savings in their savings account, higher pay in the job they had, more satisfaction in the job they had and they were in good shape financially.
BOAK: I believe that was a Fed survey. You see this interesting shift, though, in the Census pulse surveys, which show people are clearly employed in a way they haven't been. They are less dependent on unemployment benefits and the government for aid, and yet more of them say they're having trouble with meeting their weekly expenses.
THE PRESIDENT: Well, two things.
BOAK: What's that paradox?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, I think the paradox is, part of it is, I think what, the failure of the last administration to act on COVID had a profound impact on the number of people who got COVID and the number of people who died. Now here's what I'm, I think Vivek Murthy is right and most of the international and National Psychological Association, whatever it's, people are really, really down. They're really down. Their need for mental health in America has skyrocketed because people have seen everything upset. Everything they counted on upset. But most of it's a consequence of, of, of what's happening, what happened is a consequence of the, the COVID crisis.
People lost their jobs. People are out of their jobs. And then, were they going to get back to work? Schools were closed. Think of this. I think we vastly underestimate this. If you had, and instead of your child being, how old, five?
BOAK: Five.
THE PRESIDENT: Five years old. If your child had been 17 years old two years ago.
BOAK: I'm not ready for that.
THE PRESIDENT: Well get ready, man. Boy or girl?
BOAK: Girl.
THE PRESIDENT: Well I'll tell you what, she's gonna, she's going to be crazy about you until about age 13. And then hang on. But all kidding aside, here's the deal. Think about what it's like for the graduating classes of the last three years. No proms. No graduation. No, no, none of the things that celebrate who we are. Think about it across the board. How isolated we've become. How separated we've become. Even practical questions like, you know, can you go out on a date? I mean (inaudible) the normal socialization, how does that take place? There's overwhelming evidence it's had a profound impact on the psyche of parents, children, across the board. And we lost a million people.
And nine for every, according to a study, of those million people, nine significant family or close friends were left alive after they're gone.
BOAK: So you're talking about a country that has undergone profound psychological trauma.
THE PRESIDENT: Yes.
BOAK: What can you as a president do to address that psychology ...
THE PRESIDENT: Be confident.
BOAK: ... to make people feel more optimistic. Be confident?
THE PRESIDENT: Be confident. Be confident. Because I am confident. We are better positioned than any country in the world to own the second quarter of the 21st century. That's not hyperbole. That's a fact.
BOAK: And do you think that's because the U.S. is stronger, or because you see countries like China hitting speedbumps?
THE PRESIDENT: Look, I've spent more time with Xi Jinping than anybody, any other world leader. Imagine — let me put it — let me ask you a rhetorical question, and, you know, I mean, obviously you don't have to answer any of the questions.
BOAK: I'll answer whatever you need.
THE PRESIDENT: No no. No no no. But think of this. Name me a single major company, country in the world where that world leader wouldn't trade places with my problems for his in a heartbeat. Name me one. Not a joke.
BOAK: Do you think that ...
THE PRESIDENT: There are none.
BOAK: Well so, so, I mean, do you think people wouldn't want to be in Switzerland right now?
THE PRESIDENT: No, Switzerland has their own problems right now. When I said major, I meant major power, so — but, no. I mean, you know, I just had the, the American, you know, the whole hemisphere, beautiful countries in the Caribbean and beautiful countries that are, have, that are middle-class countries that are having serious problems. Everybody's having them. In the meantime, we have a little thing called climate change going on. And it's having profound impacts. We got the tundra melting. We've got the North Pole, I mean, so people are looking and, and I think it's totally understandable that they are worried because they look around and see, ""My God, everything is changing."" We have more hurricanes and tornadoes and flooding. People saw what — I took my kids years ago to Yellowstone Park. They call me, ""Daddy did you see what happened at Yellowstone, right?"" Well, it's unthinkable. These are 1,000-year kinds of events.
BOAK: And yet you face a possible tradeoff in that climate change has this big impact. And yet Americans are unhappy about the cost of gasoline
THE PRESIDENT: Sure.
BOAK: And fossil fuels. And I'm curious, like, what does that mean for you if you have to say, we need to increase production in the short term and companies say, but we don't have the long-term incentives?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, I say in the short term, do the right thing. Instead of, you know, they've made 315 or 16 billion, 35 billion dollars, these major oil companies in the first quarter. So I think it's three, twelve, five ... I don't know how many times (inaudible). Don't buy back your own stock. Don't, don't just reward yourselves. I mean, look, here's what. A lot happened. One of the things I ran on when I was running is that I, I come from the corporate capital of the world, Delaware. More corporations incorporated in my state than all the rest of the United States combined. Not a joke. Literally.
And, you know, they try to make me, my fr—, the MAGA party, tries to make me out to be this socialist. I got elected seven times, not just six, seven times, in that state. But one of the things that's changed is the notion of what constitutes corporate responsibility. The fact that you're in a situation where you have a Fortune 500 company, you got 55 paid zero taxes, made 40 billion dollars. Those surveys also show nobody, including Republicans in suburbia, think the tax system is fair. Billionaires paying 8%. All these things that are occurring that have to be shifted. It used to be, for example, I'll give you one example. It used to, am I holding up?
(Aide tells Biden time is almost up)
THE PRESIDENT: OK.
BOAK: So let me ask you because you brought it up, your domestic agenda. In speeches you've said your domestic agenda is key for helping the middle class and beating inflation.
THE PRESIDENT: Yes.
BOAK: Do you have the votes as of today, because …
BIDEN: Yes. I think it's changing. Well, first of all, I had the votes. If I had told you (garble) ... You're not doing (inaudible). I'm impressed by your objectivity, how you write. I'm not being, I shouldn't say that on the record because then you'll get in trouble.
BOAK: I'm in trouble anyway. So it's OK.
THE PRESIDENT: But all kidding aside. Usually (inaudible) the question I get asked in the beginning with the Recovery Act: Can you get this passed? How can you possibly do that? I got 1.9 trillion dollars. Saved the economy. It used to be long lines, people in nice cars like we drive. Lined up just to get a box of food in their trunk.
People getting kicked out onto the street because they couldn't pay the rent. Thousands and thousands of people. And guess what? It worked. Secondly, no, here's the important point. The second piece of this is, that it also saw to it that we were able to provide for the funding for COVID, not only, not only the shots and the shots in arms, but also all the hospital costs. We were able to reduce the cost of insurance. My point is, people would say, ""How can you get that done?"" If I did, if any other president just passed that act, and the infrastructure bill, they'd say, ""God almighty.""
Name me a president that's done anything like that before. At the same time.
(Aide tells Biden time is up.)
BOAK: I guess one of the reasons why I ask is you did something revolutionary on child poverty, and you know it, with the child tax credit, an idea that came in part from Newt Gingrich back in the day, Contract With America. And a lot of families had hope from that. They moved out of public housing.
THE PRESIDENT: That's right.
BOAK: And then last year, they learned that their incomes were effectively going down.
THE PRESIDENT: Yep.
BOAK: And so when you present your agenda to the public, the reason why I'm asking if you have the votes is because people really want to know.
THE PRESIDENT: Sure they want to know. And on that answer is no. Not one single Republican, not one, not one, would vote to extend it. We're 50/50 and we lost one Democrat vote. So I'm one vote short on that piece. But for example, I'm going to be able to get, God willing, the ability to pay for prescription drugs. There's more than one way to bring down the cost for working folks. Gasoline may be up to $5 a gallon, but somebody who has a child with stage two diabetes is paying up to a thousand bucks a month for the insulin.
We can reduce it to 35 bucks a month and get it done. We have the votes to do it. We're gonna get that done. That kinda thing. I can't get it all done. That's why I need the (inaudible) vote.
One more thing. Let's look at what our Republican friends are going to have to face with the Supreme Court decision on Roe. What they're going to have to face in terms of the Supreme Court —the failure, the failure of this Republican Party to be willing to do anything to deal with the basic social concerns of the country.
And so, I think, you know, I fully understand why the average voter out there is just confused and upset and worried. And they're worried, for example, you know, can they send their kid back to, back to college? What's going to happen? Are we going to take away the ability of people to borrow? So I think there's a lot of reasons for people to want to know what comes next.
And do I have the votes? I believe I have the votes to do a number of things. One, prescription drugs. Reduce utility bills by providing for, uh, I think, we'll be able to get the ability to have a tax incentive for winterization, which would, they estimate, bring down the average bill for the family, normal home, 500 bucks a year.
I think we would be able, we're gonna get another $57 billion for semiconductors, so we don't have the supply chain problem we had before, keeping down the cost of vehicles. I think we're going to be in a situation where, we're gonna — I know we are — where we're going to reduce a person's average internet bill by 30 bucks a month, because we have the money through the, through the uh, uh, infrastructure bill to provide internet across country.
I think we're going to be able to have a fair tax system, to have the votes, it's going to be close, to have a minimum tax on corporations of 15%, make sure we're in a situation where the people who in fact are, the idea that a billionaire is paying 8% of income and a teacher is paying 22%. I think we're going to be able to get tax increases on super wealthy. Not a lot. Not a lot. I'm a capitalist. You should be able to (inaudible). For God's sake, pay your fair share. Just pay, pay a piece of what you owe. And I think we're gonna be able to do those kinds of things.
BOAK: Were you surprised (crosstalk) ...
(Aide tells Biden time is up.)
THE PRESIDENT: I know I'm supposed to go. That's the last question.
BOAK: Were you surprised because you referenced the reason why you ran was Charlottesville. And I'm curious, have you been surprised when you say Republicans weren't going to work with you at all on some of these issues? Did that surprise you, given what you knew that compelled you to run? And how do you deal with that environment? And how does that compare to your predecessors who are on the wall?
BIDEN: Well, my predecessor on the wall didn't pass the (inaudible) his first year, number one. Number two, the reason ... you know why that predecessor is on the wall. You never saw his picture in this office before. I asked my brother to put together the office for me — decide what desk I'd have. I didn't realize the outgoing president had to be out 10 o'clock, the incoming president by 2 o'clock. And you pick what you want and you got to get it all in by then. So I (inaudible) Jon Meacham come in and he set my office up for me, and so the desk they picked, and you know everything, everything except the wallpaper. And I used to, I came in here for eight years in a row as the vice president. George Washington's photograph is over there.
And I looked and I said, ""Why Franklin Roosevelt?"" Not that I don't like Franklin Roosevelt, but why put that big portrait of Franklin Roosevelt? And Jon Meacham said, ""Because no one ever inherited that kind of big circumstances and dire, more dire straits than he did that last time."" I said, ""Oh, that's encouraging.""
And I said, ""Why Abraham Lincoln?"" And he said, ""The country's never been as divided since the Civil War."" I knew those two things coming in. But what I also believed was I could get some of it done.
There was a, I just was reading an article (inaudible) that article by the, uh, the guy talking about Biden and how he brought the country, brought Republicans together, Republicans and Democrats. Anyway, I'll, I'll get it to you. I'll find it. Oh, here you go. New York Times Magazine. That's factually correct. Now, there's a lot I couldn't get done.
BOAK: Because you're about to get the Ocean Safety Bill, which passed the House with bipartisan support.
THE PRESIDENT: Well, yeah. By the way, And when you remember, I called for that, everybody said, ""Oh, no, no no."" But guess what? It's gonna pass. But my generic point is that, you know, we're going to get gun safety. We're not going to get what I wanted. We're gonna get a part where everybody, we're gonna get the, uh, the uh, uh, the, the Innovation Competition Act, a hundred million bucks is going to be invested outside of Cleveland by Intel. We're going to have another 57 mil ... . You know, there's forced arbitration I got rid of in sexual orientation, sexual harassment cases. Juneteenth I got passed, no one said it could be done.
I'm not saying, ""Look at all I've done."" But I knew that were probably, probably 15 sort of traditional, mainstream, conservative Republicans left. And I include in that — and I'm going to get myself in trouble, and I'll get him in trouble, probably — but the minority leader from Kentucky. He's a solid, mainstream guy. But you have the, ah, the folks from Texas. You have a lot of folks who are very, very MAGA. For example, Johnson, you know, and Scott, they're. Every five years, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid go out of existence. You've got to build them back. They, these guys mean it. I mean, why in the hell did you ever think that would happen in your lifetime, and you're a young man?
BOAK: I feel like I'm getting more gray hair every day, sir. (Laughter.)
THE PRESIDENT: Well, I tell you what, well at least you're keeping it. I'd settle for orange if I had more hair. But all kidding aside, I think this is a process and I think what you're going to see this election is people voting their overall concerns as well. Even people who are not pro-choice are going to find it really, really off the wall when a woman goes across a state line and she gets arrested (garble) where she's doing. Even people who are, you know, I mean, there's so many things these guys are doing that are out of the mainstream of where the public is. And I think — but it is, I knew I was stepping into a difficult moment, but — Can I say something off the record?
(Off-the-record discussion.)

Joe Biden,"June 20, 2022",Statement on World Refugee Day,"Today, on World Refugee Day, I join people around the world in recognizing the strength, resilience, and humanity of the millions of refugees forced to flee violence, persecution, and war. This is also a moment to honor the incredible generosity of host communities, the private sector, and State and local government across the United States who work tirelessly to welcome refugees and provide them with essential support. We also laud the bravery and dedication of humanitarian workers who show up, time and again, to provide lifesaving assistance in challenging and often hazardous conditions.
As a result of Russia's war against Ukraine, we recently reached a grim milestone: According to the U.N. Refugee Agency, more than 100 million people are now forcibly displaced, more than at any other time in history. On this day, we reaffirm our commitment to work with the international community to achieve sustainable, long-term solutions to support refugees, including through resettlement. We also recommit to engaging in diplomatic efforts to address the root causes of displacement and bring an end to the ongoing conflicts that drive refugees to seek safety across borders.
The United States will do our part to ensure that those who have sought refuge here have access to the lifesaving assistance they deserve, including health care and shelter, and opportunities to pursue livelihoods and education that allow them to rebuild their lives with dignity and hope for a brighter tomorrow. We will also continue to support vulnerable refugee populations such as women, children, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTQI+) persons, and persons with disabilities.
As Americans, protecting and welcoming refugees is part of who we are. Our Nation of immigrants was founded by individuals fleeing religious persecution. As we lead the world in responding to the needs of refugees, we honor our past, enhance our economic and social fabric, and exemplify our highest values. We do this because it's the right thing to do, but helping refugees is also good foreign policy, contributing to making the world more stable and secure, which benefits us all.
This is why the United States is the largest single provider of humanitarian assistance worldwide and why I raised our annual refugee admissions cap to 125,000 for Fiscal Year 2022. My administration is working as quickly as possible to rebuild the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, to improve processing times, and to expand our domestic capacity to welcome refugees so that we are better positioned to reach this ambitious goal. We have already demonstrated, by welcoming more than 80,000 Afghans to our country over the past year, and by committing to provide temporary safe haven to tens of thousands of Ukrainians, that we will lead by example. Those who find refuge on our shores enrich our communities, as they always have, and bring a determined and entrepreneurial spirit that makes our country stronger.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-world-refugee-day-7
Joe Biden,"June 26, 2022",Statement on the International Day in Support of Victims of Torture,"Torture remains a moral stain on the world's collective conscience. That is why today, 35 years after the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment came into effect, I am proud to reaffirm that the United States stands unequivocally against this barbaric act. As one of the original drafters of the Convention, the United States remains committed to eradicating torture throughout the world.
Any instance of torture is one too many, and yet every year countless victims suffer this brutal violation of their human rights and dignity. This year we have been shocked by the horrific acts committed by Russian forces in Ukraine, including multiple, credible reports of torture such as beatings, electric shocks, and mock executions. In Mali and Burkina Faso, terrorist groups have been documented to have massacred and tortured local populations, while in Mali and Central African Republic, Kremlin-aligned Wagner mercenaries have reportedly employed similar cruel and unlawful tactics. In the Americas, transnational crime organizations, including cartels and gangs, have been reported as torturing journalists, activists, and minorities, including LGBTQI+ individuals, as a tactic to sow fear and intimidation. In Burma, reports document security forces torturing and killing those who support democracy, including through electrocution, rape, and other forms of sexual violence. Each of these examples tears at our humanity.
Today I reaffirm the United States dedication to eliminating torture and supporting its victims. The United States has legally prohibited torture in all of its forms, without exception. We also remain the top contributor to the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture, which helps nearly 50,000 victims and their families receive medical, psychological, legal, social, and other assistance necessary to rebuild their lives. And this year, I submitted to Congress a budget that requests the largest ever funding amount for the U.S. Survivors of Torture Program in HHS's Office of Refugee Resettlement.
When a government commits torture, it surrenders its moral authority and undermines its own legitimacy. And critically, when torture is committed in the name of national security, it only emboldens and multiplies enemies, fuels unrest, and leaves governments isolated internationally.
Today, and every day, let us stand in solidarity with survivors of torture, while calling on all nations to end this inhuman practice.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-the-international-day-support-victims-torture-3
Joe Biden,"June 27, 2022",Joint Statement by President Biden and President Ursula von der Leyen of the European Commission on European Energy Security,"Following the further invasion of Ukraine, Russia continues to use natural gas as a political and economic weapon. Russia's energy coercion has put pressure on energy markets, raised prices for consumers, and threatened global energy security. This was most recently demonstrated by the politically motivated acute disruptions of gas supplies to several European Union Member States. These actions only underscore the importance of the work both the United States and the European Commission are doing to end our reliance on Russian energy. We are also working together to find ways to further reduce Russia's energy-derived revenues in the coming months to further curtail Russia's ability to fund its unprovoked war in Ukraine. These actions are important, necessary, and immediate steps we can take, but we also recognize the enormity of the challenge is significant. To meet the challenge and support Europe's efforts, we established on 25 March 2022 the Task Force on European Energy Security. Since then the United States and the European Commission have made important strides towards reducing the European Union's dependence on Russian fossil fuels by decreasing natural gas demand, cooperating on energy efficiency technologies, and diversifying energy supplies. The United States and the European Commission are also taking decisive action to reduce overall demand for fossil fuels in line with the Paris Agreement and our shared goal of net zero emissions no later than 2050.
The Task Force has met regularly to discuss options to reduce Europe's demand for natural gas and has also met with key stakeholders to promote the deployment of heat pumps, smart thermostats, and energy demand response solutions. We will encourage Member States and European and U.S. companies to reach an initial goal of deploying at least 1.5 million energy saving smart thermostats in European households this year. In the coming days we will reconvene with Member States and stakeholders to discuss actionable policy recommendations to accelerate smart thermostat and heat pump deployment and production in an effort to ensure supply for key energy efficiency solutions are ramping to meet the growing demand.
We are also partnering to diversify energy supplies to Europe. While Russia has cut supplies of natural gas to several EU Member States, the United States and other producers have stepped up. Since March, global LNG exports to Europe have risen by 75 percent compared to 2021, while U.S. LNG exports to Europe have nearly tripled. To facilitate these efforts, the European Commission and Member States, in line with a mandate given by the European Council in March 2022, established the EU Energy Platform to coordinate measures to secure reliable and diversified energy supplies for the EU, including through the voluntary common purchase of pipeline gas, LNG, and hydrogen. The Commission has also established the first Regional Energy Platform for South East Europe to support gas diversification of the region traditionally dependent on Russian supplies. The United States is a key partner for the sustainable diversification of gas supplies to this region and other acutely impacted EU Member States, including by supporting demand reduction and accelerating clean technologies.
Mindful of the environmental impact of LNG production and consumption, the United States and the European Commission will step up their cooperation to reduce methane emissions, to ensure that EU-U.S. LNG trade is aligned with the scope of an internationally accepted measurement, reporting and verification standard for methane emissions while working to reduce venting and flaring in natural gas production, and methane leakage in the transmission and LNG supply chain. We will also continue our cooperation on reduction of methane emissions globally. Most recently, the joint launch with 11 other countries of the Global Methane Pledge Energy Pathway will advance both climate progress and energy security internationally.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/joint-statement-president-biden-and-president-ursula-von-der-leyen-the-european-2
Joe Biden,"June 28, 2022",Joint Declaration Between the Kingdom of Spain and the United States of America,"Spain and the United States are Allies, strategic partners, and friends. Our bilateral relationship is based on deep historical ties, shared democratic values, and a common vision for addressing global challenges. Spain and the United States are committed to upholding peace and security, protecting the planet's climate for future generations, promoting democracy and human rights, and enhancing economic prosperity around the world. To affirm our commitment to working closely together to advance these goals, the President of the Government of Spain, Pedro Sánchez Pérez Castejón, and the President of the United States of America, Joseph R. Biden, Jr., on the occasion of President Biden's visit to Spain on June 28-30, 2022, have reached the following understandings:
Reinforcing multilateral responses to transatlantic and global challenges 
1. Spain and the United States condemn Russia's unjustified and unprovoked war of choice against Ukraine, which has fundamentally altered the global strategic environment. This aggression constitutes the most direct threat to transatlantic security and global stability since the end of the Cold War. Russia's actions also threaten the food security of some of the most vulnerable people around the world. Spain and the United States intend to continue working together, along and with other partners and allies, including the rest of the EU and the G7, to support the government and the people of Ukraine and to hold Russia accountable for its violations of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, including gross violations of international law by targeting civilians with violence, and conflict-related sexual violence. Spain and the United States also reiterate their strong support for Ukraine's determination to choose its own future.
2. Spain and the United States are committed to defending the rules-based international order, which has been the foundation for preserving our security and advancing our prosperity over the past seven decades. We are fully committed to the goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We intend to strengthen international and multilateral institutions to promote strong, sustainable, and inclusive economic growth, defend democratic governance, and advance solutions to global challenges. We stand united in our determination to address challenges to that international order. In this regard we continue to encourage China to uphold its commitments within the rules-based international order, to contribute to international security, and to cooperate in the provision of global public goods, including on climate change, biodiversity and gender equality.
Strengthening defense cooperation 
3. The United States and Spain recognize the central importance of the NATO Alliance in ensuring transatlantic peace and security. As NATO Allies for 40 years, Spain and the United States are steadfastly committed to providing NATO with ready forces and capabilities, strengthening their transatlantic ties, and ensuring a 360-degree approach to security, particularly by enhancing the relationship with mutual partners, such as the European Union. The Madrid Summit hosted by Spain will ensure that NATO is united behind a new Strategic Concept guiding the Alliance's approach towards strategic competitors and transnational threats, and that NATO's military and political activities are resourced to address a more dangerous security environment.
4. Spain and the United States underline their commitment to the U.S.-Spain Agreement on Defense Cooperation signed in 1988, which, together with the shared use of Spain's bases in Rota and Morón, is an essential piece of the bilateral defense cooperation between the two countries. Spain and the United States intend to expand their defense cooperation through the permanent stationing of additional U.S. naval vessels in Rota. The two countries intend to hold regular meetings within the framework of the bilateral High-Level Defense Group to strengthen defense cooperation.
Defending democracy, human rights, and gender equality 
5. Spain and the United States share the fundamental values of support for freedom, equity and equality, democracy, and the rule of law. Both countries reaffirm their commitment to a foreign policy guided by the defense of human rights, especially the rights of women and vulnerable populations, such as people living in poverty, members of racially or ethnically marginalized groups, LGBTQI+ persons, members of religious minority groups, persons with disabilities, refugees, migrants, internally displaced persons, older adults, children, gender non-conforming persons, and trafficking victims.
6. The United States and Spain underscore the importance of promoting gender equity and equality globally. Both countries intend to work together to promote policies and initiatives that advance the rights of women and girls, including through the Women, Peace, and Security agenda. As underscored during this Summit for Democracy Year of Action, they are committed to cooperation in strengthening democratic governance and the protection and promotion of human rights throughout the world, particularly with the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean where the United States and Spain both have deep and enduring affiliations.
Intensifying collaboration on justice and security issues 
7. The United States and Spain intend to maintain and build upon their strong law enforcement cooperation, including with respect to extradition and mutual legal assistance. They plan to reinforce their collaboration in the fight against terrorism, cybercrime, drug trafficking, and trafficking in persons. They intend to strengthen cybersecurity cooperation to increase national resilience to cyber-attacks, promote responsible state behavior in cyberspace, and counter malicious cyber activity from nation states and criminal actors.
8. The United States and Spain will continue to work together to strengthen counterterrorism cooperation at the bilateral level and internationally. They also will work to curb the abuse of new information and communication technologies by terrorists, violent extremists, and authoritarian regimes.
Promoting safe, orderly, and regular migration 
9. Both countries intend to collaborate on a comprehensive approach in the management of irregular migration flows, ensuring the just and humane treatment of migrants. Both countries also plan to coordinate efforts to address the root causes of irregular migration and work to strengthen legal pathways, with a particular focus on the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean. Spain and the United States likewise recognize the importance of ongoing cooperation in response to the challenges of irregular migration in the North Africa region.
Fighting climate change and increasing energy security 
10. Spain and the United States recognize that the climate crisis is one of the most serious challenges of our time. Both countries stress the urgent need to increase global climate action to ensure that deep reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions are achieved by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050. In this light, they commit to pursuing a climate-smart recovery that strengthens biodiversity.
11. Both countries are committed to developing joint strategies to boost climate action in low and middle-income countries and sectoral strategies to accelerate the deployment of clean and renewable energy and the promotion of just transition to decarbonized and circular economies. They recognize the need to reach the Paris Agreement goals, including to accelerate global efforts to make financial flows consistent with low greenhouse gas emissions and climate resilient development. Both countries also underscore the importance of making continued progress towards the collective goal to mobilize annually 100 billion U.S. dollars for climate action in developing countries. They recognize the urgency of addressing methane in line with the Global Methane Pledge, improving adaptation to the impacts of climate change, and promoting a climate resilient development, especially in the most vulnerable countries.

They are committed to transatlantic cooperation to resolve trade, economic and technological differences; promote energy security and sustainability; and build resilient supply chains that are transparent, secure, sustainable, and diverse. They are committed to ending the race to the bottom on corporate taxation through the swift implementation of the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework's Two-Pillar Solution.
Boosting digital, scientific, and technological cooperation 
14. The United States and Spain defend a digital transformation based on a shared respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and democratic values, on reducing the digital divide, on preventing and addressing the disproportionate effects of online forms of violence and abuse on women, children, and other marginalized groups, and on the implementation of mechanisms to safeguard these principles. They express the importance of coordinating actions to mitigate security risks in the digital environment, especially the importance of working with trusted suppliers, and cooperating in defining and utilizing international standards, including open standards, and best practices that contribute to reliable and secure digitalization. They express their commitment to cooperation initiatives in the transatlantic framework, such as the EU-U.S. Trade and Technology Council, as a tool for addressing challenges in the trade, economic and technological sphere.
15. Spain and the United States intend to continue promoting joint science, space, and innovation initiatives carried out by research organizations, universities, and private companies in all fields of space and science, including through scientific-technological initiatives of the European Union. Spain and the United States plan to encourage industrial initiatives to enhance open strategic autonomy, especially in critical raw materials.

Strengthening political cooperation 
17. Spain and the United States intend to continue high-level consultations between the two governments. The Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs, European Union and Cooperation and the U.S. Secretary of State intend to continue their regular political consultations, and the Spanish Secretary of State for Foreign and Global Affairs and the U.S. Deputy Secretary of State intend to continue their regular contact. In addition, regular region- and issue-focused meetings should take place on topics of mutual interest to include Latin America and the Caribbean, the Maghreb, the Sahel, China and the Indo-Pacific, Russia, multilateral affairs, migration, science and technology, and cybersecurity.
Looking to the future 
18. In the spirit of this joint declaration, Spain and the United States intend to continue strengthening their bilateral relations, expanding on these understandings as needed. As Spain prepares for its presidency of the Council of the European Union in the second half of 2023, the two countries intend to prioritize cooperation on foreign policy, security, defense, and economic issues as they relate to the EU. Spain and the United States look forward to working together to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century and to seizing opportunities for deepening their cooperation so that it provides security and prosperity to citizens on both sides of the Atlantic.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/joint-declaration-between-the-kingdom-spain-and-the-united-states-america
Joe Biden,"July 14, 2022",Joint Statement—The Jerusalem United States-Israel Strategic Partnership Joint Declaration,"The leaders of the United States and Israel, President Biden and Prime Minister Lapid, met in Jerusalem on 14 July 2022, and adopted the following Joint Declaration on the US-Israel Strategic Partnership:
The United States and Israel reaffirm the unbreakable bonds between our two countries and the enduring commitment of the United States to Israel's security. Our countries further reaffirm that the strategic U.S.-Israel partnership is based on a bedrock of shared values, shared interests, and true friendship. Furthermore, the United States and Israel affirm that among the values the countries share is an unwavering commitment to democracy, the rule of law, and the calling of ""Tikkun Olam,"" repairing the world. The leaders express appreciation to former Prime Minister Bennett, who led the most diverse government in Israel's history, and under whose leadership this extraordinary partnership has continued to grow stronger.
Consistent with the longstanding security relationship between the United States and Israel and the unshakeable U.S. commitment to Israel's security, and especially to the maintenance of its qualitative military edge, the United States reiterates its steadfast commitment to preserve and strengthen Israel's capability to deter its enemies and to defend itself by itself against any threat or combination of threats. The United States further reiterates that these commitments are bipartisan and sacrosanct, and that they are not only moral commitments, but also strategic commitments that are vitally important to the national security of the United States itself.
The United States stresses that integral to this pledge is the commitment never to allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon, and that it is prepared to use all elements of its national power to ensure that outcome. The United States further affirms the commitment to work together with other partners to confront Iran's aggression and destabilizing activities, whether advanced directly or through proxies and terrorist organizations such as Hezbollah, Hamas, and Palestinian Islamic Jihad.
The United States and Israel note that nothing better reflects the steadfast and bipartisan support of the United States to Israel's security than the unprecedented Memoranda of Understanding on security assistance signed by successive U.S. administrations over the last few decades, and that these arrangements demonstrate in word and deed that the United States considers Israel's security essential to U.S. interests and an anchor of regional stability.
The United States strongly supports implementing the terms of the current historic $38 billion Memorandum of Understanding in full, which honors the United States' enduring commitment to Israel's security, as well as its conviction that a follow-on MOU should address emerging threats and new realities. In addition, the United States is committed to seeking additional missile defense assistance in excess of MOU levels, in exceptional circumstances such as the hostilities with Hamas over eleven days in May 2021. Israel appreciates the U.S. commitment to the MOU and for providing an additional $1 billion over MOU levels in supplemental missile defense funding following the 2021 conflict. Further, the countries express enthusiasm to move forward the U.S.-Israel defense partnership through cooperation in cutting-edge defense technologies such as high energy laser weapons systems to defend the skies of Israel and in the future those of other U.S. and Israel security partners.
Israel thanks the United States for its ongoing and extensive support for deepening and broadening the historic Abraham Accords. The countries affirm that Israel's peace and normalization agreements with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Morocco constitute a critical addition to Israel's strategic peace treaties with Egypt and Jordan, all of which are important to the future of the Middle East region and to the cause of regional security, prosperity, and peace. The countries note that the historic Negev Summit, initiated and hosted by Prime Minister Lapid, was a landmark event in joint U.S.-Israeli efforts to build a new regional framework that is changing the face of the Middle East.
The United States and Israel welcome in this regard the meeting held in Manama, Bahrain on June 27th, forming the Negev Forum on regional cooperation. The United States welcomes these developments and is committed to continue playing an active role, including in the context of President Biden's upcoming visit to Saudi Arabia, in building a robust regional architecture; to deepen the ties between Israel and all of its regional partners; to advance Israel's regional integration over time; and to expand the circle of peace to include ever more Arab and Muslim States.
The United States and Israel also welcome the opportunity to participate in a quadrilateral (hybrid) meeting, together with the leaders of India and the United Arab Emirates, in the context of the I2U2 initiative, bringing together these four countries to advance cooperation in economy and strategic infrastructure, and demonstrating the importance of this new partnership, first launched by their Foreign Ministers in October 2021.
The United States and Israel reiterate their concerns regarding the ongoing attacks against Ukraine, their commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and affirmed the importance of continued humanitarian assistance to the people of Ukraine.
The United States and Israel affirm that they will continue to work together to combat all efforts to boycott or de-legitimize Israel, to deny its right to self-defense, or to unfairly single it out in any forum, including at the United Nations or the International Criminal Court. While fully respecting the right to freedom of expression, they firmly reject the BDS campaign. The two countries will use the tools at their disposal to fight every scourge and source of antisemitism and to respond whenever legitimate criticism crosses over into bigotry and hatred or attempts to undermine Israel's rightful and legitimate place among the family of nations. In this context, they express their deep concern over the global surge in antisemitism and reassert their commitment to counter this ancient hatred in all of its manifestations. The United States is proud to stand with the Jewish and democratic State of Israel, and with its people, whose uncommon courage, resilience, and spirit of innovation are an inspiration to so many worldwide.
The United States and Israel commit to continuing to discuss the challenges and opportunities in Israeli-Palestinian relations. The countries condemn the deplorable series of terrorist attacks against Israeli citizens in recent months and affirm the need to confront radical forces, such as Hamas, seeking to inflame tension and instigate violence and terrorism. President Biden reaffirms his longstanding and consistent support of a two-state solution and for advancing toward a reality in which Israelis and Palestinians alike can enjoy equal measures of security, freedom and prosperity. The United States stands ready to work with Israel, the Palestinian Authority, and regional stakeholders toward that goal. The leaders also affirm their shared commitment to initiatives that strengthen the Palestinian economy and improve the quality of life of Palestinians.
The United States and Israel enjoy extensive bilateral cooperation and dialogue between their two countries in many critical spheres—from groundbreaking collaboration in science and technology, to unique intelligence sharing and joint military exercises, to shared efforts in confronting pressing global challenges such as climate change, food security, and healthcare. To complement the extensive existing scientific and technological cooperation between their two countries, and to bring their cooperation to a new height, the leaders launched a new U.S.-Israel Strategic High-Level Dialogue on Technology to form a U.S.-Israel technological partnership in critical and emerging technologies, as well as in areas of global concern: pandemic preparedness, climate change, artificial intelligence, and trusted technology. This new technological partnership will be designed to boost the countries' mutual innovation ecosystems and address geostrategic challenges.
In this same spirit, the United States and Israel affirm their commitment to continue their shared and accelerated efforts to enable Israeli passport holders to be included in the U.S. Visa Waiver Program as soon as possible, as well as their support for increased collaboration on operational cyber exchange and on combatting cybercrime. The leaders state that all of these initiatives, and countless other joint endeavors, undertaken between their peoples at every level of government and civil society demonstrate that the U.S.-Israel strategic partnership is indispensable and makes an outsized contribution not only to the good of American and Israeli citizens but also to the good of the Middle East and of the world.
With this record of remarkable achievement and with a sense of the incredible promise that the unparalleled U.S.-Israel relationship holds for the future, the United States and Israel warmly welcome entering the 75th year of this extraordinary partnership.
Signed at Jerusalem on the 14th day of the July, 2022, which corresponds to the 15th day of Tamuz, 5782, in the Hebrew calendar, in duplicate in the English language.

Joe Biden,"July 16, 2022",Joint Statement by President Biden and the Leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council Nations,"1. At the invitation of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, King of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) member states and the United States met today in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The leaders noted the previous U.S.-GCC Summits held on May 14, 2015 in Camp David, and on April 21, 2016 and May 21, 2017 in Riyadh. The leaders reaffirmed the strategic importance of the historic ties between their countries, and their shared commitment to build upon the achievements of previous summits to strengthen cooperation, coordination, and consultation in all fields.
2. The leaders affirmed their commitment to joint cooperation to bolster global economic recovery efforts, address the economic repercussions caused by the pandemic and the war in Ukraine, ensure the resiliency of supply chains and the security of food and energy supplies, develop clean energy sources and technologies, and assist countries in need by helping address their humanitarian and relief needs.

Joe Biden,"July 16, 2022",Joint Statement by President Biden and President Abdelfattah Said Elsisi of Egypt,"President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. met with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi today in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia to reaffirm their shared commitment to the U.S.-Egypt strategic partnership, consult on a broad range of global and regional security challenges, and advance the U.S.-Egypt relationship. In celebrating the milestone of 100 years of U.S.-Egypt diplomatic relations, President Al Sisi and President Biden expressed their intention to meet again in the near future to further enhance the two countries' multi-faceted partnership. The two leaders renewed their commitment to the U.S.-Egypt Strategic Dialogue co-chaired by Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken and Minister of Foreign Affairs Sameh Shoukry and welcomed the continued implementation of its outcomes.
Strengthening our shared security 
The decades-long U.S.-Egypt defense partnership remains a key pillar of regional stability. Both Presidents affirmed the importance of this partnership, which serves the interests of both countries. President Biden reiterated that the United States aims to continue to support Egypt in providing for its own defense, including through the continued provision of security assistance in consultation with the U.S. Congress. Both Presidents affirmed their commitment to cooperate on counter-terrorism and welcomed the notable achievements of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS. President Al Sisi expressed Egypt's appreciation for military equipment and security assistance from the United States.
Advancing economic prosperity 
Both Presidents expressed their commitment to furthering bilateral economic cooperation for the mutual benefit of the Egyptian and American people. They decided to explore new ways to expand bilateral trade, increase private sector investments, and collaborate on clean energy and climate technology. The leaders welcomed the recent U.S. GreenTech Mission to Egypt, the largest in history, and committed to launch the high-level Joint Economic Commission.
The impact of the war in Ukraine 
The United States and Egypt underlined that peace, security and a multilateral, rules-based order lie at the heart of their longstanding partnership. Recalling the March 2nd and March 24th United Nations General Assembly resolutions on Ukraine, which both voted in favor of, they reaffirmed their shared principles enshrined in the UN Charter, including the respect for international law, territorial integrity, and national sovereignty. The two Presidents emphasized the need to refrain from the use of force, solve conflicts by peaceful means, and end violations of human rights in conflict areas. The United States and Egypt share particular concerns over the severe global consequences that stem from the war in Ukraine, including on global supply chains and energy and commodity prices. For example, the blockading of Black Sea ports has triggered rising food insecurity and levied significant economic pressures on Egypt.
President Biden underscored U.S. support for the Egyptian people in responding to these challenges. To this end, the United States commends Egypt's consultations with the International Monetary Fund and supports the provision of additional funding to Egypt through the IMF's Resilience and Sustainability Trust. The United States also lends its full support to Egypt's engagement with the World Bank to seek financing options to stabilize its economy and strengthen the well-being of Egyptian households, in particular through the Crisis Response Finance Package recently announced by the Bank. President Biden conveyed that the United States is providing $1 billion in new assistance to address the food security situation in the Middle East, with $50 million specifically for Egypt. These funds aim to bolster food security and offset the effects of the disruption in agricultural supply chains and higher food prices due to the blocking of ports. President Biden assured President Al Sisi that the United States will advocate for Egypt and its food security needs.
Promoting regional stability 
The United States and Egypt are cooperating closely to mediate solutions to regional conflicts and promote peace. The two leaders stressed that a two-state solution remains the only viable path to achieve a lasting resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and to realize a secure, prosperous, and dignified future for Israelis and Palestinians alike.

The two leaders underscored the need to implement United Nations Security Council resolutions 2570, 2571 (2021), reaffirming the necessity of holding presidential and parliamentary elections in tandem as soon as possible in Libya. They emphasized the importance of the full withdrawal of all foreign forces, mercenaries, foreign fighters, and the pivotal role of the 5+5 Joint Military Committee in this regard, including the prompt development of timelines. President Biden thanked President Al Sisi for Egypt's role in helping to consolidate the Yemen Truce, particularly through facilitating commercial flights from Sana'a to Cairo, an important component of the UN-mediated truce arrangement. The two Presidents committed to regular consultations to resolve regional conflicts and humanitarian crises in Syria, Lebanon, and Sudan. Regarding the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), President Biden reiterated U.S. support for Egypt's water security and to forging a diplomatic resolution that would achieve the interests of all parties and contribute to a more peaceful and prosperous region. The two leaders reiterated the imperative of concluding an agreement on the filling and operation of the GERD without further delay as stipulated in the Statement of the President of the United Nations Security Council dated September 15, 2021, and in accordance with international law.
Promoting human rights 
President Biden and President Al Sisi emphasized their mutual commitment to a constructive dialogue on human rights, which is an integral component of the strong U.S.-Egypt partnership. They will continue to consult closely on ensuring the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms in political, civil, economic, social and cultural fields. The two leaders reaffirmed the important role that civil society can play in these areas.
Accelerating global efforts to tackle the climate crisis 
President Biden congratulated President Al Sisi for Egypt presiding over the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 27) in Sharm El Sheikh in November 2022 and reaffirmed the United States' commitment to a successful Conference. The United States welcomes Egypt's leadership in accelerating global ambition and action to tackle the climate crisis. President Biden welcomed Egypt's submission of its updated nationally determined contribution (NDC). Both leaders emphasized their countries' support for the Global Methane Pledge (GMP) and the new GMP Energy Pathway, which Egypt has joined with respect to the oil and gas sector. The two leaders reaffirmed the U.S. and Egypt's new partnership on Adaptation in Africa, which the U.S. and Egypt will co-lead, focused on delivering concrete initiatives that will improve people's lives and help build resilience to a changing climate.

Joe Biden,"July 28, 2022",Statement Commemorating 100 Years of United States-Baltic States Diplomatic Relations,"Today we mark 100 years of unbroken diplomatic relations between the United States and our three Baltic allies: Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. Through a century of struggle and reclamation, the United States has always stood by the legitimate governments of these three countries. Back in 1940, as Soviet troops occupied the Baltic nations by force, our State Department issued the Welles Declaration. It affirmed the ""universally known"" policy of the United States: that we believe in sovereignty, self-determination and territorial integrity; and that we oppose predatory actions carried out by threats or force. More than 60 years later, when I was a Senator, the United States proudly welcomed the Baltic States as allies in NATO. At every turn, we have remained steadfast in our commitment to their freedom and sovereignty. As we celebrate our longstanding friendship, we also reaffirm that universally known policy.
With sovereignty and territorial integrity in Europe once more under assault, we are united with our allies and partners to defend freedom, democracy, and security. The United States stands shoulder to shoulder with Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania to counter Russia's brutal and unprovoked war on Ukraine and to hold Russia accountable. Few know better what is at stake. And as allies, we will continue to strengthen the security of Europe and defend every inch of NATO territory. The United States will continue working closely with Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania on the full range of global challenges to ensure the next century brings greater peace, security, and freedom for all.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-commemorating-100-years-united-states-baltic-states-diplomatic-relations
Joe Biden,"August 01, 2022",Statement on the Tenth Review Conference for the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,"Today, as the world gathers for the Tenth Review Conference for the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), the United States renews its commitment to the world to be a responsible steward of its nuclear arsenal and to continue working toward the ultimate goal of a world without nuclear weapons. That commitment is why the United States joined together with the other nuclear weapons states in January to affirmatively state our shared belief that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought, and it is why my administration has prioritized reducing the role of nuclear weapons in our national security strategy.
I've worked on arms control from the earliest days of my career, and the health of the NPT has always rested on meaningful, reciprocal arms limits between the United States and Russian Federation. Even at the height of the cold war, the United States and the Soviet Union were able to work together to uphold our shared responsibility to ensure strategic stability. Today my administration is ready to expeditiously negotiate a new arms control framework to replace New START when it expires in 2026. But negotiation requires a willing partner operating in good faith. And Russia's brutal and unprovoked aggression in Ukraine has shattered peace in Europe and constitutes an attack on fundamental tenets of international order. In this context, Russia should demonstrate that it is ready to resume work on nuclear arms control with the United States. China also has a responsibility as an NPT nuclear weapons state and a member of the P5 to engage in talks that will reduce the risk of miscalculation and address destabilizing military dynamics. There is no benefit to any of our nations, or for the world, to resist substantive engagement on arms control and nuclear nonproliferation.
The United States is determined to lead by the power of our example. Through diplomacy—in coordination with our allies and regional partners—we have developed a proposal to secure a mutual return to full implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action to ensure that Iran does not acquire a nuclear weapon. We are working closely with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to ensure the AUKUS partnership among Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States meets the highest nonproliferation standards. And we are reestablishing our leadership in the peaceful use of nuclear energy, including seeking to establish the IAEA Additional Protocol as a universal standard for both international safeguards and for nuclear supply arrangements and continuing our efforts to limit the spread of sensitive enrichment and reprocessing technology.
In this moment of uncertainty and upheaval on the global stage, reaffirming our shared commitment to the grounding principles of the global nonproliferation regime has never been more crucial. The world can be confident that my administration will continue to support the NPT and seek to strengthen the nonproliferation architecture that protects people everywhere.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-the-tenth-review-conference-for-the-treaty-the-non-proliferation-nuclear-weapons
Joe Biden,"August 24, 2022",Statement on Ukraine's Independence Day,"On behalf of all Americans, I congratulate the people of Ukraine on their Independence Day. Over the past 6 months, Ukrainians have inspired the world with their extraordinary courage and dedication to freedom. They have stood resolute and strong in the face of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. And today is not only a celebration of the past, but a resounding affirmation that Ukraine proudly remains—and will remain—a sovereign and independent nation.
The United States of America is committed to supporting the people of Ukraine as they continue the fight to defend their sovereignty. As part of that commitment, I am proud to announce our biggest tranche of security assistance to date: approximately $2.98 billion of weapons and equipment to be provided through the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative. This will allow Ukraine to acquire air defense systems, artillery systems and munitions, counter-unmanned aerial systems, and radars to ensure it can continue to defend itself over the long term.
I know this Independence Day is bittersweet for many Ukrainians as thousands have been killed or wounded, millions have been displaced from their homes, and so many others have fallen victim to Russian atrocities and attacks. But 6 months of relentless attacks have only strengthened Ukrainians' pride in themselves, in their country, and in their 31 years of independence. Today and every day, we stand with the Ukrainian people to proclaim that the darkness that drives autocracy is no match for the flame of liberty that lights the souls of free people everywhere. The United States, including proud Ukrainian Americans, looks forward to continuing to celebrate Ukraine as a democratic, independent, sovereign and prosperous state for decades to come.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-ukraines-independence-day
Joe Biden,"September 15, 2022",Statement on the International Day of Democracy,"Fifteen years ago, nations from around the world came together to declare an International Day of Democracy, a day to reflect on our collective support for representative, transparent governance; equality; respect for human rights and dignity; and the rule of law. In the years since, democracy the world over has experienced significant challenges, with autocrats and illiberal forces increasing the pressure on those who fight for human rights and fundamental freedoms. We see it in Russia's brutal and unjustified war of aggression against Ukraine. And here at home, we are called to renew our commitment to defend and protect the core tenets of American democracy.
Our Founders established a Government of, by, and for the people, built on the unique idea that all people are created equal. They recognized that the strength of a democracy rests in the ability of its people to make their voices heard. And today I'm proud to be hosting at the White House the ""United We Stand"" Summit to counter hate-fueled violence, reaffirming that we all have a role to play in fostering a safe, inclusive, and democratic society. In recent months, we've also demonstrated that our democracy can still deliver for the American people. Working together with Congress, I've been proud to sign into law transformative legislation that will grow the American economy and create more good-paying jobs for American workers, invest in infrastructure, reduce gun violence, improve access to health care, and protect our climate.
The United States is also working closely with fellow democracies around the world to tackle the greatest global challenges of our time, and I look forward to building on the progress next year at the second Summit for Democracy. This second gathering of world leaders from governments, civil society, labor, and the private sector will be an opportunity to demonstrate how democracies are working to make life better for people everywhere, and to redouble to our efforts to defend against authoritarianism, combat corruption, and advance human rights.
On this International Day of Democracy, we pause to reflect on the power that we hold in our in our hands and our sacred charge to preserve the soul of our Nation; to preserve that idea of America; to respect the rule of law, and defend free and fair elections. And we renew our dedication to uphold and strengthen our precious democracy and to keep faith with future generations.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-the-international-day-democracy-0
Joe Biden,"September 18, 2022","Interview with Scott Pelley of CBS' ""60 Minutes""","Scott Pelley. Mr. President, as you know, last Tuesday the annual inflation rate came in at 8.3%. The stock market nosedived. People are shocked by their grocery bills. What can you do better and faster?
The President. Well, first of all, let's put this in perspective. Inflation rate month to month was just-- just an inch, hardly at all.
Pelley. You're not arguing that 8.3% is good news.
The President. No, I'm not saying it is good news. But it was 8.2% or-- 8.2% before. I mean, it's not-- you're ac-- we act-- make it sound like all of a sudden, ""My god, it went to 8.2%."" It's been--
Pelley. It's the highest inflation rate, Mr. President, in 40 years.
The President. I got that. But guess what we are. We're in a position where, for the last several months, it hasn't spiked. It has just barely-- it's been basically even. And in the meantime, we created all these jobs and-- and prices-- have-- have gone up, but they've come down for energy. The fact is that we've created 10 million new jobs. We're in-- since we came to office. We're in a situation where the-- the unemployment rate is about 3.7%. one of the lowest in history. We're in a situation where manufacturing is coming back to the United States in a big way. And look down the road, we have mas-- massive investments being made in computer chips and-- and employment. So, I-- look, this is a process. This is a process.
Pelley. Is the economy going to get worse before it gets better?
The President. No. I don't think so. We hope we can have what they say, ""a soft landing,"" a transition to a place where we don't lose the gains that I ran to make in the first place for middle-class folks, being able to generate good-paying jobs and-- expansion. And at the same time-- make sure that we-- we are-- are able to continue to grow.
Pelley. And you would tell the American people that inflation is going to continue to decline?
The President. No, I'm telling the American people that we're gonna get control of inflation. And their prescription drug prices are gonna be a hell of a lotta lower. Their health care costs are gonna be a lot lower. Their basic costs for everybody, their energy prices are gonna be lower. They're gonna be in a situation where they begin to gain control again. I'm-- more optimistic than I've been in a long time.
Pelley. Sir, with the Federal Reserve rapidly raising interest rates, what can you do to prevent a recession?
The President. Continue to grow the economy. And we're growing the economy. It's growing in-- in a way that it hasn't in years and years.
Pelley. How so?
The President. We're growing entire new industries. Six hundred and ninety-five, I think it is, or eighty-five thousand new manufacturing jobs just since I've become president in United States. Continue to grow the economy and continue to give hard-working people a break in terms of we pay the highest drug prices in the world of any industrialized nation. Making sure that Medicare can negotiate down those prices by the way, we've also reduced the debt and reduced the deficit by $350 billion my first year. This year, it's gonna be over $1.5 trillion reduced the debt. So, to continue to put people in a position to be able to make a decent living and grow, and grow, and increase their capacity to grow.
Pelley. Mr. President, first Detroit Auto Show in three years. Is the pandemic over?
The President. The pandemic is over. We still have a problem with COVID. We're still doing a lotta work on it. It's-- but the pandemic is over. if you notice, no one's wearing masks. Everybody seems to be in pretty good shape. And so I think it's changing. And I think this is a perfect example of it.
Pelley. Mr. President, the price of gasoline is down about 26% from the $5 high. What can you do to keep that price down while Vladimir Putin is throttling energy supplies?
The President. Well, there's-- there's a couple things we've done. For example, remember I got some criticism for releasing a million barrels of oil a day from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And then along came the industry saying they'd produce another million barrels a day by the spring. So, I think we're in relatively good shape.
Pelley. Vladimir Putin is going to try to break your will on Ukraine and use energy prices to do it.
The President. Sure he is. But, you know, we, the United States, are in much better shape than-- than anyone else is, and relative to Russia particularly. But-- he's been trying that for a while. He's not gonna succeed.
The President. One of the things that happens in negotiations, particularly if they've been elongated like these have, is people say and do things where they-- the pride gets engaged as well. And it's awful hard to back off of some of these things. They both sat down, in my view-- and they were in the office today saying, ""Well, we finally figured it out. This is fair on both sides."" And it took that time to focus. And-- and the alternative was just not thinkable.
Pelley. What do you mean?
The President. If, in fact, they'd gone on a strike, the supply chains in this country would've come to a screeching halt. We would've seen a real economic crisis.
Pelley. Is Ukraine winning the war?
The President. Ukraine, through their-- the significant help we and our allies are giving them and the incredible bravery and the incredible determination of the Ukrainian people, are not losing a war, and they're making gains in certain areas. Winning the war in Ukraine is to get Russia out of Ukraine completely and recognizing the sovereignty. they're defeating Russia. Russia's turning out not to be as competent and capable as many people thought they were gonna be. But winning the war? the damage it's doing, and the-- and the citizens, and the innocent people are being killed, it's awful hard to count that as winning.
The President. It has been barbaric, what he's done. His attacks on civilian-- everything from civilian hospitals to-- to, you know, people-- old-age homes, to neighborhoods where just ordinary people live--
Pelley. Schools.
The President. --to schools, it's-- it's just outrageous. And-- so the-- the price Ukrainian people are paying for this war is extremely high. But we're gonna stay with 'em as long as they need our help.
Pelley. You're already north of $15 billion in terms of those commitments. How far do you go?
The President. As long as it takes.
Pelley. Ironclad commitment?
The President. Yes.
Pelley. As Ukraine succeeds on the battlefield, Vladimir Putin is becoming embarrassed and pushed into a corner. And I wonder, Mr. President, what you would say to him if he is considering using chemical or tactical nuclear weapons.
The President. Don't. Don't. Don't. You will change the face of war unlike anything since World War II.
Pelley. And the consequences of that would be what?
The President. I am not going to speculate--
Pelley. What would the U.S. response be?
The President. You think I would tell you if I knew exactly what it would be? Of course, I'm not gonna tell you. It'll be consequential. They'll become more of a pariah in the world than they ever have been. And depending on the extent of what they do will determine what response would occur.
Pelley. What should Chinese President Xi know about your commitment to Taiwan?
The President. We agree with what we signed onto a long time ago. And that there's one China policy, and Taiwan makes their own judgments about their independence. We are not moving-- we're not encouraging their being independent. We're not-- that-- that's their decision.
Pelley. But would U.S. Forces defend the island?
The President. Yes, if in fact there was an unprecedented attack.
Pelley. So unlike Ukraine, to be clear, sir, U.S. Forces, U.S. men and women would defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion?
The President. Yes.
Pelley. Have you been briefed, sir, on the top-secret documents that were found at Mar-a-Lago?
The President. No.
Pelley. No one has come to you to warn you that important national security secrets were revealed by the storage of those documents at the former president's home?
The President. I have not personally spoken to anyone on that-- in that regard. I'm sure my administration is aware of all of that, and so is the National Security Council. But I have not.
Pelley. were you notified of the FBI's execution of a search warrant at Mar-a-Lago?
The President. No. Not ahead of time.
Pelley. When you saw the photograph of the top-secret documents laid out on the floor at Mar-a-Lago, what did you think to yourself? Looking at that image.
The President. How that could possibly happen. How one-- anyone could be that irresponsible. And I thought What data was in there that may compromise sources and methods? By that I mean names of people who helped or th-- et cetera. And it just-- totally irresponsible.
Pelley. And you don't know what was in those documents?
The President. I have not asked for the specifics of those documents because I don't want to get myself in the middle of whether or not the Justice Department should move or not move on certain actions they could take. I-- I agreed I would not tell them what to do and not, in fact, engage in telling them how to prosecute or not.
Pelley. Sir, are you committed to running again, or are there certain conditions that have to be right?
The President. Look, if I were to say to you, I'm running again, all of a sudden, a whole range of things come into play that I have-- requirements I have to change and move and do.
Pelley. In terms of election laws?
The President. In terms of election laws. And it's much too early to make that kind of decision. I'm a great respecter of fate. And so, what I'm doing is I'm doing my job. I'm gonna do that job. And within the timeframe that makes sense after this next election cycle here, going into next year, make a judgment on what to do.
Pelley. You say that it's much too early to make that decision. I take it the decision has not been made in your own head.
The President. Look, my intention as I said to begin with is that I would run again. But it's just an intention. But is it a firm decision that I run again? That remains to be seen.
Pelley. Mr. President, you are the oldest president ever.
The President. Pretty good shape, huh?
Pelley. Which leads to my next question. You are more aware of this than anyone. Some people ask whether you are fit for the job. And when you hear that, I wonder what you think.
The President. Watch me. And ma-- honest to God, that's all I think. Watch me. If you think I don't have the energy level or the mental acuity, then-- then, you know, that's one thing. It's another thing, you just watch and-- and, you know, keep my schedule. Do what I'm doing. I-- I think that-- you know-- I don't-- when I sit down with our NATO allies and keep 'em together, I don't have 'em saying, ""Wait a minute, w-- how-- how old are you? What are you-- what say?"" You know, I mean, it's a matter of, you know, that old expression: The proof of the pudding's in the eating. I mean, I-- I-- I respect the fact that people would say, you know, ""You're old."" And-- but I think it relates to h-- how much energy you have, and whether or not the job you're doing is one consistent with what any person of any age would be able to do.
Pelley. How would you say your mental focus is?
The President. Oh, it's focused. I'd say it's-- I think it's-- I-- I haven't-- look, I have trouble even mentioning, even saying to myself, my own head, the number of years. I no more think of myself as being as old as I am than fly. I mean, it's just not-- I haven't-- observed anything in terms of-- there's not things I don't do now that I did before, whether it's physical, or mental, or anything else.
Pelley. You have had a string of legislative successes recently.
The President. How'd an old guy do that?
Pelley. But your approval rating in the country is well below 50%. And I wonder why you think that is.
The President. This is a really difficult time. We're at an inflection point in the history of this country. We're gonna make decisions, and we're making decisions now, that are gonna determine what we're gonna look like the next ten years from now. I think you'd agree that the impact on the psyche of the American people as a consequence of the pandemic is profound. Think of how that has changed everything. You know, people's attitudes about themselves, their families, about the state of the nation, about the state of their communities. And so there's a lot of uncertainty out there, a great deal of uncertainty. And we lost a million people. A million people to COVID. When I got in office, when I-- I got elected, only 2 million people had been vaccinated. I got 220 million-- m-- my point is it takes time. We were left in a very difficult situation. it's been a very difficult time. Very difficult.
Pelley. Mr. President, if you run again, Republicans are most likely to go after your son Hunter once again. And I wonder what you would like to say about your son and whether any of his troubles have caused conflicts for you or for the United States.
The President. I love my son, number one. He fought-- an addiction problem. He overcame it. He wrote about it. And no, there's not a single thing that I've observed at all from th-- that would affect me or the United States relative to my son Hunter.
The President. For example, we passed the most extensive gun legislation in 30 years, although I'm not gonna rest till we get assault weapons banned, which I did once before when I was a senator.
Pelley. Assault weapons banned?
The President. Assault-- assault weapons banned. There's no rationale. Deer aren't running through the woods wearing Kevlar vests.
Pelley. Somebody came in and told you about Uvalde when it happened, and I wonder what you thought.
The President. Again, I've gone to every one of those places. And in Uvalde, I spent time with every sing-- four hours. Four hours in the pain, pain, and it's just so, so unnecessary. So wrong. Who the hell m-- (SIGH) don't get me going. But I met with every one of those families and i-- and-- and the extended families for four hours. look, our kids should be learning how to read and write, not duck and cover. Think about that. Think of the mental impact on these kids going back to school. We saw it. It's wrong. It's wrong. It's not who we are. And we've gotta stop it. We've got to stop it. And the NRA continuing to push the sale of-- assault and semiautomatic weapons is bizarre.
Pelley. Concerning politics, Mr. President, you were elected to the Senate in 1972. You were 29 years old. And in those days, it seemed that the parties worked together to move the country forward. And I think many Americans feel that that no longer happens, and, in fact, may be impossible now.
The President. Well, I don't think it's impossible. But it-- it-- it's changed. What we do today, think about it, it's all personal attacks. It's about motive. It's not about, ""I disagree with you on the-- on the subject matter. And secondly, I think that-- it's-- I think it's fair to say that we've not had a president like the last president, who has made all of it so personal. I've had six Republican senators, I promised I'd never say their names and I won't, come up to me in the last two years and say, ""Joe, I agree with you, but if I-- if I vote this way it's gonna-- they're gonna primary me. I'm gonna lose an election."" It didn't used to be that way. But it's coming back a little bit. It's coming back.
Pelley. Do you see it? It seems to me, Mr. President, that-- when you were-- first came to the Senate, the other guy had a bad idea, and now the other guy is a bad guy. And I don't know how you get back to that--
The President. Well, I'll tell you what, think about this. I was able to get-- we were able to get a bipartisan $1.2 trillion package done for dealing with the whole question of rebuilding the country, the roads and the highways. the fact of the matter is we've gotten a lot of things done bipartisanly. And everybody said, ""We're not gonna do anything, don't let Biden have any successes,"" et cetera. So it's still a way to go, but I think we're making some progress.
Pelley. You have lived a long life of triumph and tragedy. In November you'll be 80. And I wonder what it is that keeps you in the arena.
The President. Well, look-- I've had tragedies. I've lost part of my soul when I lost my son Beau, I lost my wife and my daughter in an accident. I think of all the people who've gone through what I've gone through and a lot more without what I had. I have had incredibly supportive family. There's so many, literally, heroes getting up every day putting one foot in front of the other with no help, I constantly think what would Beau want me to do? What would-- and, you know, this gets me a long way, this rosary.
The President. And he's looking up, and what's he say? He says, ""Why me, God?"" And the next scene, a voice from heaven, ""Why not?"" That's my dad. ""Why not, Joey? Why not you? Why not-- what makes you so different? Just get up."" My mom's expression was, ""Just get up. Get up. Get up.""
Pelley. And you feel you have more to give.
The President. A lot more to give. A lot more to give.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-scott-pelley-cbs-60-minutes
Joe Biden,"September 23, 2022",Statement on Russia's Annexation Referendums in Ukraine,"The United States will never recognize Ukrainian territory as anything other than part of Ukraine. Russia's referenda are a sham, a false pretext to try to annex parts of Ukraine by force in flagrant violation of international law, including the United Nations Charter. We will work with our allies and partners to impose additional swift and severe economic costs on Russia. The United States stands with our partners around the world—and with every nation that respects the core tenets of the U.N. charter—in rejecting whatever fabricated outcomes Russia will announce. We will continue to support the Ukrainian people and provide them with security assistance to help them defend themselves as they courageously resist Russia's invasion.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-russias-annexation-referendums-ukraine
Joe Biden,"September 23, 2022",Joint Statement by Group of Seven (G-7) Nations Leaders on Russia's Annexation Referendums in Ukraine,"We, the Leaders of the Group of Seven (G7), strongly condemn the sham referenda that Russia attempts to use to create a phony pretext for changing the status of Ukrainian sovereign territory, which is subject to an ongoing Russian aggression. These actions clearly breach the United Nations Charter and international law and go diametrically against the rule of law among nations.
These sham referenda initiated today by Russia and its proxies have no legal effect or legitimacy, as demonstrated by Russia's hasty methods of organisation, which in no way respect democratic norms, and its blatant intimidation of local populations. These referenda in areas that have been forcibly put under Russia's temporary control in no way represent a legitimate expression of the will of the Ukrainian people, who have consistently resisted Russian efforts to change borders by force. We will never recognise these referenda which appear to be a step toward Russian annexation and we will never recognise a purported annexation if it occurs.
In addition, we deplore deliberate Russian escalatory steps, including the partial mobilisation of reservists and irresponsible nuclear rhetoric.
We call upon all countries to unequivocally reject these sham referenda as Russia's attempt to give false cover to its violations of international law. We stand ready to impose further economic costs on Russia, and on individuals and entities—inside and outside of Russia—providing political or economic support for Russia's illegal attempts to change the status of Ukrainian territory.
We are steadfast in our commitment to providing the support Ukraine needs to uphold ist sovereignty and territorial integrity, to defend itself, and to choose its own future. We will continue to provide financial, humanitarian, military, diplomatic and legal support, and will move ahead on reconstruction efforts, including through the International Expert Conference on the Recovery, Reconstruction and Modernisation of Ukraine in Berlin on 25 October.
We will stand firmly with Ukraine for as long as it takes.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/joint-statement-group-seven-g-7-nations-leaders-russias-annexation-referendums-ukraine
Joe Biden,"September 29, 2022",Joint Statement—Declaration on U.S.-Pacific Partnership,"We—the governments of Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, French Polynesia, Nauru, New Caledonia, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Republic of the Marshall Islands, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, and the United States of America—meet on the occasion of the first-ever U.S.-Pacific Islands Summit, held at the White House in Washington, D.C. from 28-29 September 2022. Forged by shared history, sacrifice, and values, our partnership has contributed to prosperity, peace, and security in the Pacific Islands, the United States, and the world for generations. Today, in the face of a worsening climate crisis and an increasingly complex geopolitical environment, we recommit ourselves to working together in genuine partnership to address the mounting challenges of our time.
First, we resolve to strengthening our partnership. 
We share a vision for a resilient Pacific region of peace, harmony, security, social inclusion, and prosperity, where individuals can reach their potential, the environment can thrive, and democracy will be able to flourish. The Pacific Islands vision is reflected in its guiding documents which include the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent, a vision that the United States strongly supports. Achieving our shared vision requires a sustained partnership that is rooted in mutual respect, transparency, and accountability. This long-term partnership will require greater capacity; Pacific leaders welcome the United States' commitment to enhance its engagement, including by expanding its diplomatic presence, the ties between our peoples, and U.S. development cooperation across the region.
We place the highest priority on the resolution of unresolved issues and the timely and successful completion of negotiations relating to the Compacts of Free Association between the United States and the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the Republic of Palau—one of the cornerstones of U.S.-Pacific cooperation for nearly four decades. The United States recognizes that new resources must be part of any successful negotiation. The United States will amplify its efforts as a Dialogue Partner in the Pacific Islands Forum and will work with partners in consultation with the Pacific to deliver results for the region efficiently, effectively, and transparently.
Second, we commit to bolstering Pacific regionalism. 
The Pacific Islands region is stronger united. We acknowledge the important role played by the Pacific Islands Forum in this regard.
Together we commit to bolstering Pacific regionalism, elevating and strengthening Pacific voices in international fora, and enhancing U.S. engagement with relevant Pacific regional organizations, including the Pacific Islands Forum and the Council of Regional Organizations of the Pacific agencies. We will seek greater connectivity between these organizations and other partners who share Pacific objectives and values.
We recognize the central role of the international system, particularly the United Nations, in addressing transnational challenges. Crises will continue to affect our global community in the future. We therefore recognize the urgency of strengthening the global governance architecture to make it fit for purpose and to ensure effective and timely responses to such crises, taking into account the special circumstances of small island developing states (SIDS).
Third, we are committed to tackling the climate crisis together as a priority. We take the climate crisis as the highest priority of our partnership, for it remains the single greatest existential threat to the livelihoods, security, traditional and customary practices, and wellbeing of people in the Pacific region, including as reflected in the Boe Declaration on Regional Security.
We are united in our commitment to implement the Paris Agreement and we are committed to work together to advance progress at COP27 and beyond. We urge all countries—especially major emitters—whose 2030 nationally determined contributions targets are not yet aligned with the Paris temperature goal to increase their ambition and align such targets with a 1.5 °C pathway before COP27. We urge all developed countries to deliver on their commitment to the goal of mobilizing $100 billion annually through 2025 to support developing countries, in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation. We urge all countries to reduce collective anthropogenic methane emissions at least 30 percent by 2030 from 2020 levels.
We recognize the importance of international collaboration and accelerated action especially within this decade on aviation and shipping emissions, to help put both sectors on a pathway aligned with keeping a 1.5 °C limit to temperature rise within reach.
As we combat the climate crisis, we will also work together to enhance the Pacific Islands' climate resilience; increase their access to climate finance; cooperate to support the Pacific Islands to adapt to the impacts of climate change, from rising sea levels to more frequent flooding, cyclones and typhoons, drought and extreme weather events that contribute to the heightened risk of water, energy; and food and health insecurity. We are further committed to working together and with other countries and stakeholders to scale up finance and support related to averting, minimizing and addressing loss and damage, in particular for vulnerable developing countries.
Fourth, we are committed to enhancing our cooperation to advance economic growth and sustainable development in the Pacific. 
We commit to linking our economies more closely for the benefit of all our peoples.
We also seek to forge links within the region, supporting infrastructure, transportation connectivity, cybersecurity capacities, and digital infrastructure in the Pacific.
We will be expanding our cooperation to enhance the development of the sustainable blue economy, including small- and medium-sized enterprises, labor, forestry, fisheries, agriculture, trade, tourism, and addressing supply chains issues and food security.
We recognize that the COVID-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc on Pacific economies. Economic recovery will be a top priority requiring finance not only for rebuilding purposes but to meet the commitments we made in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals. To this end, we support the work of the UN Panel on Multidimensional Vulnerability Index (MVI) for Small Island Developing States and look forward to their recommendations. We encourage relevant international institutions to consider incorporating the MVI into their assessment processes where appropriate.
We further acknowledge the urgent and immediate need for assistance with vulnerability to debt, post-COVID-19.
Fifth, we are committed to supporting each other to better prepare and respond to natural disasters. 
The Pacific region continues to bear the brunt of extreme natural disasters from dangerous high tides, tsunamis, ashfalls and volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, and increasing frequency of severe cyclones, hurricanes, and droughts. The increasing occurrence of these natural disasters poses existential threats to Pacific SIDS and require protracted periods of recovery, putting further pressure on limited fiscal spending space. To this end, urgent actions and long-term planning are required to increase the capacity of Pacific SIDS to predict and cope with these disasters and to implement adaptation, disaster risk reduction, and resilience strategies. The recent events in Tonga, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, and Kiribati in recent years clearly demonstrate the devastation of natural disasters in the region.
Sixth, we resolve to protect the Blue Pacific and enhance the laws that govern it. 
Together we will strengthen our cooperation on maritime security, maritime conservation, and the sustainable use of the Pacific Ocean based on the rule of law.
We acknowledge the threats posed by climate change-related sea-level rise to regional security, peace, prosperity, and development. It is essential that maritime zones and the rights and entitlements that flow from them must be maintained without reduction, notwithstanding any physical changes connected to climate change-related sea-level rise, recognizing that SIDS and other coastal States have planned their development in reliance on their rights to such maritime zones. We will continue to cooperate on fisheries-related economic development and oceans resilience through the Multilateral Treaty on Fisheries between the Pacific Islands States and the Government of the United States of America and its related Economic Assistance Agreement, while also forging new ties to improve maritime domain awareness, search and rescue, and maritime security; to curb the scourge of marine debris and plastic pollution; and to combat illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing—a threat to the Pacific environment and livelihoods.
We will build partner capacity and capability to ensure rapid response to contingencies and emerging threats, including maritime security and safety.
Together we will find solutions to the major challenges facing the Ocean including through our commitment to conserve and protect 30% of the Ocean by 2030. We further commit to concluding very soon negotiations on the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework under the Convention on Biological Diversity and a robust international legally binding instrument under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction. We renew our commitment to implementing Sustainable Development Goal 14 of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development including its targets through genuine and durable partnerships, in a manner that fully addresses the special circumstances of SIDS.
We reaffirm the legal rights and obligations that apply with respect to all states under international law as reflected in UNCLOS.
Seventh, we resolve to maintain peace and security across the Blue Pacific Continent. 
The Blue Pacific Continent has been a place of peace for nearly eight decades. We seek to ensure it remains so. In promoting peace and security, we recognize the importance of international law as reflected in UNCLOS, including on freedom of navigation and overflight. We will oppose all efforts to undermine the territorial integrity and sovereignty of any country, large or small. We condemn all wars of aggression, including Russia's brutal war against Ukraine.
We reaffirm our respect for the ability of nations to make sovereign decisions in the best interests of their people. The Pacific Islands note the United States' commitment to enhance and deepen its security cooperation in the region. All of us in the Pacific region and the global economy benefit from peace and stability.
Eighth, we commit to continuing our cooperation in addressing COVID-19 concerns and other health-related issues. We will continue to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and other infectious-disease threats while strengthening regional and national health systems and capabilities, and strengthening the capability to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats, including through relevant regional organizations; and increase our collective commitments towards adequate, stronger, and sustainable global financing for future pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response.
Non-communicable disease is a top health priority for the Pacific Islands. We recognize the importance of addressing this issue given its impact on the health of our populations and the economic prosperity of our nations.
Ninth, we commit to expanding opportunities for all our peoples. 
Our deepest ties are between our peoples. We will strengthen connections between the United States and Pacific Islands through support for education, training, youth development, and exchange opportunities. We will identify priority areas for strengthening people-to-people ties and ways to address them.
We will redouble our commitment to gender equity and equality, including the elimination of gender-based violence, both online and offline, taking full account of the 2012 Pacific Leaders Gender Equality Declaration. Together we will continue to strengthen democratic institutions across the Pacific, including through support for accountability, transparency, anti-corruption, civil society, human rights, and an independent and free media environment.
We acknowledge the critical role of the diaspora in the sustainable development of Pacific Islands and commit to strengthen links between the diaspora and local communities. We encourage expanding opportunities for diaspora investments.
We recognize the power of sports in bringing people together and commit to support the development of sports in the Pacific region. Expanding sports ties between our countries and peoples will lead to greater understanding of one another's societies and build support for areas like health and youth development. We also recognize the positive influence of coaching and the structures which support sport.
Tenth, we reaffirm our commitment to comprehensively address the legacies of conflict and the promotion of nuclear nonproliferation. 
World War II ended nearly 80 years ago, but its scars remain in the Pacific. We, too, acknowledge the nuclear legacy of the Cold War. The United States remains committed to addressing the Republic of the Marshall Islands' ongoing environmental, public health concerns, and other welfare concerns.
The United States is committed to the safe removal and disposal of unexploded ordnance, and hereby acknowledges the concerns of Pacific Island States regarding other remnants of World War II. We are united in our support for the nuclear nonproliferation regime, including the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty; as well as the important role of the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Eleventh, way forward and future implementation of the Partnership. 
This joint vision will guide us as we enter the most consequential period in the history of our partnership. Its implementation will proceed in accordance with, and be guided by, the principles it sets out: mutual respect, transparency, and accountability. To that end, our political leaders, as appropriate, and our officials will meet regularly, bilaterally and collectively, to ensure our partnership continues to deliver practical results for our people and the world. We welcome cooperation with all partners, in the region and beyond, who share in the objectives and values stated hereto. This statement is made in the respect of the competences of the signatories and of the respective governments.

Joe Biden,"September 30, 2022",Statement on Russia's Attempt To Annex Ukrainian Territory,"The United States condemns Russia's fraudulent attempt today to annex sovereign Ukrainian territory. Russia is violating international law, trampling on the United Nations Charter, and showing its contempt for peaceful nations everywhere.
Make no mistake: These actions have no legitimacy. The United States will always honor Ukraine's internationally recognized borders. We will continue to support Ukraine's efforts to regain control of its territory by strengthening its hand militarily and diplomatically, including through the $1.1 billion in additional security assistance the United States announced this week.
In response to Russia's phony claims of annexation, the United States, together with our allies and partners, are announcing new sanctions today. These sanctions will impose costs on individuals and entities—inside and outside of Russia—that provide political or economic support to illegal attempts to change the status of Ukrainian territory. We will rally the international community to both denounce these moves and to hold Russia accountable. We will continue to provide Ukraine with the equipment it needs to defend itself, undeterred by Russia's brazen effort to redraw the borders of its neighbor. And I look forward to signing legislation from Congress that will provide an additional $12 billion to support Ukraine.
I urge all members of the international community to reject Russia's illegal attempts at annexation and to stand with the people of Ukraine for as long as it takes.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-russias-attempt-annex-ukrainian-territory
Joe Biden,"October 07, 2022",Statement Congratulating the Nobel Peace Prize Recipients,"This year's Nobel Peace Prize winners remind us that, even in dark days of war, in the face of intimidation and oppression, the common human desire for rights and dignity cannot be extinguished. On behalf of the American people, I congratulate Ales Bialiatski of Belarus, Ukraine's Center for Civil Liberties, and the Russian organization Memorial on this deserved honor.
For years, they have tirelessly fought for human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the right to speak freely and criticize openly. They have pursued their mission with passion and persistence. Throughout its history, Memorial has revealed the truth about the abuse of Soviet and Russian citizens, despite intense intimidation. Ales Bialiatski has never backed down from demanding the democratic freedoms the Belarusian people deserve, even while imprisoned. And, in the midst of Russia's brutal and unprovoked war against Ukraine, the Center for Civil Liberties is documenting in real time the war crimes and atrocities Russia is inflicting on the Ukrainian people.
Above all, the brave souls who do this work have pursued the truth and documented for the world the political repression of their fellow citizens: speaking out, standing up, and staying the course while being threatened by those who seek their silence. In doing so, they have made our world stronger. Ales Bialiatski, the Center for Civil Liberties, and Memorial deserve to be recognized for the work they have done, the example they have set, and the hope they inspire for a better future through their unwavering dedication to fundamental freedoms.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-congratulating-the-nobel-peace-prize-recipients-0
Joe Biden,"October 10, 2022",Statement on Russia's Missile Strikes Against Ukraine,"The United States strongly condemns Russia's missile strikes today across Ukraine, including in Kyiv. These attacks killed and injured civilians and destroyed targets with no military purpose. They once again demonstrate the utter brutality of Mr. Putin's illegal war on the Ukrainian people.
We offer our condolences to the families and loved ones of those who were senselessly killed today, as well as our best wishes for the recovery of those who were wounded.
These attacks only further reinforce our commitment to stand with the people of Ukraine for as long as it takes. Alongside our allies and partners, we will continue to impose costs on Russia for its aggression, hold Putin and Russia accountable for its atrocities and war crimes, and provide the support necessary for Ukrainian forces to defend their country and their freedom.
We again call on Russia to end this unprovoked aggression immediately and remove its troops from Ukraine.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-russias-missile-strikes-against-ukraine
Joe Biden,"October 11, 2022",Joint Statement by Group of Seven (G-7) Nations Leaders on Ukraine,"1. We, the leaders of the Group of Seven (G7), convened today with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Our meeting took place against the backdrop of the most recent missile attacks against civilian infrastructure and cities across Ukraine, leading to the death of innocent civilians. We condemn these attacks in the strongest possible terms and recall that indiscriminate attacks on innocent civilian populations constitute a war crime. We will hold President Putin and those responsible to account.
2. The G7 firmly condemn and unequivocally reject the illegal attempted annexation by Russia of Ukraine's Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhya and Kherson regions in addition to the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the City of Sevastopol. We solemnly reiterate that we will never recognise this illegal annexation or the sham referenda that Russia uses to justify it.
3. Russia has blatantly violated the principles enshrined in the UN Charter. They cannot and do not give Russia a legitimate basis to change Ukraine's borders. We call upon all countries to unequivocally reject these violations of international law and demand that Russia cease all hostilities and immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw all of its troops and military equipment from Ukraine.
4. We have imposed and will continue to impose further economic costs on Russia, including on individuals and entities—inside and outside of Russia—providing political or economic support for Russia's illegal attempts to change the status of Ukrainian territory.
5. We deplore deliberate Russian escalatory steps, including the partial mobilisation of reservists and irresponsible nuclear rhetoric, which is putting global peace and security at risk. We reaffirm that any use of chemical, biological or nuclear weapons by Russia would be met with severe consequences.
6. We condemn Russia's actions at Ukraine's Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant and the pressure exerted on the personnel of the facility. This is a further irresponsible escalation and we will hold Russia responsible for any incident caused by their actions. The safety, security and safeguards of the nuclear facility are paramount and we support the International Atomic Energy Agency's efforts in this regard.
7. We reiterate our call on the Belarusian authorities to stop enabling the Russian war of aggression by permitting Russian armed forces to use Belarusian territory and by providing support to the Russian military. The announcement of a joint military group with Russia constitutes the most recent example of the Belarusian regime's complicity with Russia. We renew our call on the Lukashenko regime to fully abide by its obligations under international law.
8. We reaffirm our full support to Ukraine's independence, territorial integrity and sovereignty in its internationally recognised borders. In line with international law, in particular the UN Charter, Ukraine has the legitimate right to defend itself against Russian aggression and to regain full control of its territory within its internationally recognised borders.
9. We reassured President Zelenskyy that we are undeterred and steadfast in our commitment to providing the support Ukraine needs to uphold its sovereignty and territorial integrity. We will continue to provide financial, humanitarian, military, diplomatic and legal support and will stand firmly with Ukraine for as long as it takes. We are committed to supporting Ukraine in meeting its winter preparedness needs.
10. With a view to a viable post-war peace settlement, we remain ready to reach arrangements together with interested countries and institutions and Ukraine on sustained security and other commitments to help Ukraine defend itself, secure its free and democratic future, and deter future Russian aggression. We will continue to coordinate efforts to meet Ukraine's urgent requirements for military and defense equipment. We look forward to the outcomes of the International Expert Conference on the Recovery, Reconstruction and Modernisation of Ukraine on October 25.
11. No country wants peace more than Ukraine, whose people have suffered death, displacement and countless atrocities as the result of Russian aggression. In solidarity with Ukraine, the G7 Leaders welcome President Zelenskyy's readiness for a just peace. This should include the following elements: respecting the UN Charter's protection of territorial integrity and sovereignty; safeguarding Ukraine's ability to defend itself in the future; ensuring Ukraine's recovery and reconstruction, including exploring avenues to do so with funds from Russia; pursuing accountability for Russian crimes committed during the war.
12. We are deeply troubled by the deliberate damage to the Nordstream pipelines in international waters in the Baltic Sea and strongly condemn any deliberate disruption of critical infrastructure. We welcome ongoing investigations.
13. We will act in solidarity and close coordination to address the negative impact of Russia's aggression for global economic stability, including by continuing to cooperate to ensure energy security and affordability across the G7 and beyond.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/joint-statement-group-seven-g-7-nations-leaders-ukraine
Joe Biden,"October 11, 2022",Interview with Jack Tapper of CNN,"TAPPER: Thank you so much for doing this, sir. Appreciate it.
THE PRESIDENT: Happy to.
TAPPER: So, for people at home, who don't know? This is the Map Room. During World War II, this is where -- it was basically the Situation Room for FDR. He would look at sensitive information. And now, we're at a period, where there's another high-stakes war in Europe. You recently said that this is the first time, since the Cuban Missile Crisis, that there's a legitimate possibility of someone using a nuclear weapon, which could lead to ""Armageddon."" That's the word you used. How realistic is it, do you think that Putin would use a tactical nuclear weapon?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, I don't think he will. But I think it's irresponsible of him to talk about it, the idea that a world leader of one of the largest nuclear powers in the world says he may use a tactical nuclear weapon in Ukraine. The whole point I was making was it could lead to just a horrible outcome. And not because anybody intends to turn it into a world war, or anything. But it just -- once you use a nuclear weapon, the mistakes that can be made, the, miscalculations? Who knows what would happen?
TAPPER: What is the red line, for the United States and NATO? And have you directed the Pentagon, and other agencies, to game-out, what a response would be, if he did use a tactical nuclear weapon, or if he bombed the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, in Ukraine, or anything along those lines?
THE PRESIDENT: There's been discussions on that. But I'm not going to get into that. It'd be irresponsible of me, just to talk about what we would or wouldn't do.
TAPPER: Have you asked the Pentagon to game it out, though? I mean, just in case?
THE PRESIDENT: The Pentagon didn't have to be asked.
TAPPER: So, French President Macron told me that he doesn't think that Putin is acting rationally. And he said that he thinks a lot of this is because of how isolated Putin was, for two years, during the pandemic. And others, who have dealt with him, Condi Rice, and Bob Gates, and James Clapper, have used words, like ""Erratic,"" and ""Unhinged,"" to describe Putin's behavior, today. Do you think Putin is a rational actor?
THE PRESIDENT: I think he is a rational actor who's miscalculated significantly. I think he thought -- you may recall, I pointed out that they were going to invade that all those 100,000 or more troops there? And no one believed that he was going to invade Ukraine. You listen to what he says. If you listen to the speech, he made, after when that decision was being made? He talked about the whole idea of he was needed to be a leader of Russia that united all of a Russian speaker -- I mean, it just -- I just think it's irrational.
TAPPER: So, if he's not rational? And --
THE PRESIDENT: No, I didn't say he's not rational.
TAPPER: You said the speech is what --
THE PRESIDENT: I think -- I think the speech is.
TAPPER: OK.
THE PRESIDENT: His objectives were not. I think he thought, Jake, I think he thought he's going to be welcomed with open arms, that this was, this has been the home of Mother Russia, and Kyiv, and they were -- he was going to be welcomed. And I think he just totally miscalculated.
TAPPER: So, you talked about this, a few days ago, the search for an off-ramp for him. Because, his back is against the wall, there are questions about how rational he is. He already was a brutal dictator. What is the off-ramp? Is there any acceptable way that he can leave, in his mind, without seizing territory, in a way that would not be acceptable to Ukraine?
THE PRESIDENT: I don't know what's in his mind. But clearly, he could leave. He could just flat leave, and still probably hold his position together in Russia, the idea that he's been able to convince the significant Russian -- of the Russian people that this is something that he thought made sense, but now he's accomplished what he wanted to do, and it's time to bring Russians home.
TAPPER: Would you be willing to meet with him at the G20?
THE PRESIDENT: Look, I have no intention of meeting with him. But, for example, if he came to me, at the G20, and said, ""I want to talk about the release of Griner,"" I'd meet with him. I mean, it would depend. But I can't imagine -- look, we've taken a position. I just did a G7 meeting this morning. The idea, nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine. So, I'm not about to, nor is anyone else prepared to negotiate with Russia, about them, staying in Ukraine, keeping any part of Ukraine et cetera. So, it would depend on specifically what he wanted to talk about. But look, he's acted brutally. He's acted brutally. He, I think, he's committed war crimes. And so, I don't -- I don't see any rationale, to meet with him now.
TAPPER: When people hear the word, ""Armageddon,"" they get scared. From -- used by a U.S. President? They get scared.
THE PRESIDENT: Yes.
TAPPER: Do you think in any way, discussing this type of thing, publicly, openly, Putin's possible use of nuclear weapons, might have the opposite effect of what you want? It might make some of our wobblier European allies be even more scared of confronting Putin?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, no, I don't think so at all. I think, look, it was directed -- when I'm talking about, I'm talking to Putin. He in fact, cannot continue with impunity, to talk about the use of a tactical nuclear weapon, as if that's a rational thing to do. The mistakes get made. And given them -- and the miscalculation could occur. No one can be sure what would happen, and it could end in Armageddon.
TAPPER: And you still are afraid of that, though, that it could?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, no, I don't think anyone, any rational person is saying the initial use of tactical -- of a nuclear weapon, killing thousands of people, does not have the prospect of leading to something that can be way out of control.
TAPPER: Let's turn to Saudi Arabia. Some of your Democratic allies, on Capitol Hill, are afraid that the U.S. got played, when you went to Saudi Arabia, and fist-bumped with the Crown Prince. Because now, obviously, a few months later, Saudi-backed OPEC, is slashing oil production, in partnership with Russia. The Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Menendez, just called for a freeze on cooperation, with Saudi Arabia, including most arms sales. Senator Durbin, the number two Democrat, in the Senate, says the Saudis sided with Russia, against the United States. Do you think it's time, for the U.S., to rethink its relationship, with Saudi Arabia?
THE PRESIDENT: Yes. And, by the way, let's get straight why I went. I didn't go to one -- about oil. I went about making sure that we made sure that we weren't going to walk away, from the Middle East, and what was going on. And, by the way, today, I just got off the telephone, with the President of -- I got off the phone, with the Prime Minister of Israel, and the President of Lebanon. They've worked out a deal. They've been at war -- declared war, with one another, for a long time. They've worked out a boundary relationship, along the -- in the Eastern Mediterranean, for oil. And they're going to make an agreement that is historic. We also got overflights, for Israeli planes, over Saudi Arabia. We got movement, in terms of how we would deal in the Middle East, with aggression from Iran. But it wasn't in other -- eight other -- there are eight other parties there. It wasn't about -- it wasn't about oil.
TAPPER: OK. But you would --
THE PRESIDENT: But we should, we should, and I am, in the process, when the -- this House and Senate gets back, they're going to have to -- there's going to be some consequences, for what they've done, with Russia.
TAPPER: What kind of consequences? Menendez says, suspend all arms sales. Is that something you'd consider?
THE PRESIDENT: I'm not going to get into what I'd consider and what I'm having in mind. But there will be -- there will be consequences.
TAPPER: The midterm elections are four weeks from today. The economy remains top of mind, for voters. JPMorgan Chase CEO said the U.S. is likely to enter a recession, in the next nine months. Bank of America says the U.S. could start losing 175,000 jobs a month. Gas prices are on the rise again. Should the American people prepare for a recession?
THE PRESIDENT: No. Look, they've been saying this now how -- every six months, they say this. Every six months, they look down the next six months, and say what's going to happen. It hadn't happened yet. It hadn't been -- there has -- there is no -- there's no guarantee that there's going to recession. I don't think there will be a recession. If it is, it'll be a very slight recession. That is, we'll move down slightly. Well, look, think about what's happened. We have done more. We're in a better position than any other major country in the world, economically and politically. We are -- we still have real problems. But look what we got done. We passed so much legislation that significantly it makes a -- makes the point about, for example, the American Rescue Plan, the legislation to deal with inflation, the Inflation Act, we moved along. I mean, there's so much has been accomplished, that the idea that there's something -- there's an automaticity to recession is just not -- is just not there. They keep -- they've been predicting this off and on, for the last 
TAPPER: But you just said that a slight recession is possible?
THE PRESIDENT: It is possible. Look, it is possible. I don't anticipate it. But I do think -- look, we talk about the impact on families. The families are, they have reason to be concerned, about energy prices. They have reason to be concerned about a whole range of issues. But look, what we've done. We've been able to -- the Inflation Reduction Act. There's -- look, I know I always quoted my dad. But my dad used to say, ""What -- is there any breathing room, for a middle- class family?"" And the breathing room is after all the bills are paid, at the end of the month, they have anything left. And there's more than one way to bring down the cost, monthly cost, for people, who in fact are struggling, that to make sure they have -- the ends meet, and they have enough money. And that's what we've done with Inflation Reduction Act. Look, we've reduced drug prices. We've allowed, for the first time, we've been trying for years, to get Medicare to be able to negotiate drug prices. We pay the highest drug price of any nation in the world, any major nation. We are going to be in a situation, where no senior is going to have to pay more than $2,000 a year, for the drugs, no matter how much they cost. We've reduced the price -- we are going to make sure that nobody has to pay more than $35 a month for insulin, et cetera. So, there's so much that we've done. And the same with, on energy. We passed the -- look, what I ran on, I said we're going to deal with energy.
TAPPER: Right.
THE PRESIDENT: And the energy problem, we're going to deal with the whole notion of global warming. We passed $368 billion worth of help, which, as the same banker is talking about, is going to bring a $1.7 trillion -- million dollar, billion dollars off the sidelines, in investment. Look what's happened -- look at the investment that's going on, in America, right now.
TAPPER: Yes.
THE PRESIDENT: More now --
TAPPER: So, you think Democrats have something to run on?
THE PRESIDENT: Oh, I think we do. I know we do. And here's the contrast. We know it -- what's the Republican platform to run on? What are they running on? What are they for? Well, they want to put Social Security, on the chopping block. Every five years, and the other leader comes along, and says, ""No, every year, it should be up for grabs."" Medicare, Medicaid. I mean, these aren't negotiable items, in terms of whether you're going to have a continuum or not. They -- and they've -- the first thing they said they're going to do is get rid of the Inflation Reduction Act. And so, what's that doing? They're going to raise drug prices, raise medical costs, again, be sure that we're going to no longer be able to have the ability, to have tax credits, for weatherizing your homes, and money?
TAPPER: Right.
THE PRESIDENT: I mean, I don't know what they're for.
TAPPER: Our reporting, CNN's reporting, and ""The Washington Post"" reporting suggests that prosecutors think they could -- they have enough, to charge your son, Hunter, for tax crimes, and a false statement about a gun purchase. Personally and politically, how do you react to that?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, first of all, I'm proud of my son. This is a kid, who got -- not a kid, he's a grown man. And he got hooked on, like many families have had happened, hooked on drugs. He's overcome that. He's established a new life. He is, I'm confident that he is -- what he says, and does, are consistent with what happens.
TAPPER: And, for example, he wrote a book about his problems, and was straightforward about it. I'm proud of him. He came along and said -- by the way, this thing about a gun? I didn't know anything about it. But turns out that when he made application, to purchase a gun, what happened was he said -- I guess, you get asked -- I don't guess.
THE PRESIDENT: You get asked the question, ""Are you on drugs? You use drugs?"" He said, ""No."" And he wrote about saying ""No,"" in his book.
TAPPER: Right.
THE PRESIDENT: So, I have great confidence in my son. I love him. And he's on the straight and narrow, and he has been, for a couple years now. And I'm just so proud of him.
TAPPER: You're about to turn 80, next month. Happy birthday, ahead of time!
THE PRESIDENT: [Laughs]
TAPPER: Whenever anyone raises concerns about your age, the oldest president, in the history of the United States, you always say, ""Watch me."" Voters have been watching you. Democratic voters approve of the job you're doing. Democratic voters, overwhelmingly, like you. But one poll shows that almost two-thirds of Democratic voters want a new nominee in 2024. And the top reason they gave was your age. So what's your message, to Democrats, who like you, who like what you've done, but are concerned about your age and the demands of the job?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, they're concerned about whether or not I'd get anything done. Look what I've gotten done. Name me a president, in recent history, who's gotten as much done, as I have, in the first two years. Not a joke. You may not like what I got done. But the vast majority of the American people do like what I got done. And so, I just, it's a matter of, can you do the job. And I believe I can do the job. I've been able to do the job. I've gotten more done. I got the Inflation Reduction. I got all these pieces of legislation passed. And I ran on that. I said, this is what I was going to do. And I'm still getting it done. We've had, dealing with, making sure that veterans get compensated for the, for --
TAPPER: The burn pits.
THE PRESIDENT: The burn pits.
TAPPER: Yes.
THE PRESIDENT: Making sure that we're in a situation, where we finally have action on guns. And, by the way, I'm going to get the assault weapons ban. Before this is over, I'm going to get that. Again, not a joke. And watch. And so, I just think there's a, you know, it's a matter of, has anybody done more, in the first two years of their administration, for a guy, who was -- they've been saying this about my age for -- since I began to run. And so, you know?
TAPPER: You --
THE PRESIDENT: Will you come work out with me in the morning?
TAPPER: Anytime! Anytime! The big question, of course, is when you're going to make an official announcement, about whether or not you're going to run for 2024, for re-election. Do you think you'll make a decision before the end of the year?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, look, I'm not going to make this about my decision. I'm going to make this off-year election. After that's done, in November, and then I'm going to be in the process of deciding.
TAPPER: Is one of the calculations that you think you're the only one who can beat Donald Trump?
THE PRESIDENT: I believe I can beat Donald Trump again.
TAPPER: All right, Mr. President, thank you so much for your time today. We really appreciate it.
THE PRESIDENT: Thank you.
TAPPER: And I know you're rooting for the Phillies!
THE PRESIDENT: That's a fact! If I weren't, I'd be sleeping alone. I married a Philly girl!
TAPPER: Yes. All right. Thank you, sir.
THE PRESIDENT: Thank you.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-jack-tapper-cnn
Joe Biden,"October 12, 2022",Statement on the United Nations General Assembly Vote To Condemn Russia's Illegal Attempts To Annex Ukrainian Territory,"Today the overwhelming majority of the world—nations from every region, large and small, representing a wide array of ideologies and governments—voted to defend the United Nations Charter and condemn Russia's illegal attempt to annex Ukrainian territory by force. One hundred and forty-three nations stood on the side of freedom, sovereignty, and territorial integrity, even more than the 141 nations that voted in March to unequivocally condemn Russia's war against Ukraine. Only four chose to side with Russia: Belarus, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Nicaragua, and Syria.
By attacking the core tenets of the U.N. Charter, Russia is tearing at the very foundations of international peace and security. The stakes of this conflict are clear to all, and the world has sent a clear message in response: Russia cannot erase a sovereign state from the map. Russia cannot change borders by force. Russia cannot seize another country's territory as its own. Ukraine is entitled to the same rights as every other sovereign country. It must be able to choose its own future, and its people must be able to live peacefully inside its internationally recognized borders.
Nearly 8 months into this war, the world has just demonstrated that it is more united and more determined than ever to hold Russia accountable for its violations. Together with the U.N. General Assembly, we will not tolerate illegal attempts at annexation or the theft of a neighbor's land by force. We will stand up for international law, the U.N. Charter, and the rights and protections it affords to Ukraine and its people—and to every state and people everywhere.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-the-united-nations-general-assembly-vote-condemn-russias-illegal-attempts-annex
Joe Biden,"October 12, 2022",Statement on the National Security Strategy,"From the earliest days of my Presidency, I have argued that our world is at an inflection point. How we respond to the tremendous challenges and the unprecedented opportunities we face today will determine the direction of our world and impact the security and prosperity of the American people for generations to come. The 2022 National Security Strategy outlines how my Administration will seize this decisive decade to advance America's vital interests, position the United States to outmaneuver our geopolitical competitors, tackle shared challenges, and set our world firmly on a path toward a brighter and more hopeful tomorrow.
Around the world, the need for American leadership is as great as it has ever been. We are in the midst of a strategic competition to shape the future of the international order. Meanwhile, shared challenges that impact people everywhere demand increased global cooperation and nations stepping up to their responsibilities at a moment when this has become more difficult. In response, the United States will lead with our values, and we will work in lockstep with our allies and partners and with all those who share our interests. We will not leave our future vulnerable to the whims of those who do not share our vision for a world that is free, open, prosperous, and secure. As the world continues to navigate the lingering impacts of the pandemic and global economic uncertainty, there is no nation better positioned to lead with strength and purpose than the United States of America.
From the moment I took the oath of office, my Administration has focused on investing in America's core strategic advantages. Our economy has added 10 million jobs and unemployment rates have reached near record lows. Manufacturing jobs have come racing back to the United States. We're rebuilding our economy from the bottom up and the middle out. We've made a generational investment to upgrade our Nation's infrastructure and historic investments in innovation to sharpen our competitive edge for the future. Around the world, nations are seeing once again why it's never a good bet to bet against the United States of America.
We have also reinvigorated America's unmatched network of alliances and partnerships to uphold and strengthen the principles and institutions that have enabled so much stability, prosperity, and growth for the last 75 years. We have deepened our core alliances in Europe and the Indo-Pacific. NATO is stronger and more united than it has ever been, as we look to welcome two capable new allies in Finland and Sweden. We are doing more to connect our partners and strategies across regions through initiatives like our security partnership with Australia and the United Kingdom (AUKUS). And we are forging creative new ways to work in common cause with partners around issues of shared interest, as we are with the European Union, the Indo-Pacific Quad, the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, and the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity.
These partnerships amplify our capacity to respond to shared challenges and take on the issues that directly impact billions of people's lives. If parents cannot feed their children, nothing else matters. When countries are repeatedly ravaged by climate disasters, entire futures are wiped out. And as we have all experienced, when pandemic diseases proliferate and spread, they can worsen inequities and bring the entire world to a standstill. The United States will continue to prioritize leading the international response to these transnational challenges, together with our partners, even as we face down concerted efforts to remake the ways in which nations relate to one another.
In the contest for the future of our world, my Administration is clear-eyed about the scope and seriousness of this challenge. The People's Republic of China harbors the intention and, increasingly, the capacity to reshape the international order in favor of one that tilts the global playing field to its benefit, even as the United States remains committed to managing the competition between our countries responsibly. Russia's brutal and unprovoked war on its neighbor Ukraine has shattered peace in Europe and impacted stability everywhere, and its reckless nuclear threats endanger the global non-proliferation regime. Autocrats are working overtime to undermine democracy and export a model of governance marked by repression at home and coercion abroad.
These competitors mistakenly believe democracy is weaker than autocracy because they fail to understand that a nation's power springs from its people. The United States is strong abroad because we are strong at home. Our economy is dynamic. Our people are resilient and creative. Our military remains unmatched—and we will keep it that way. And it is our democracy that enables us to continually reimagine ourselves and renew our strength.
So, the United States will continue to defend democracy around the world, even as we continue to do the work at home to better live up to the idea of America enshrined in our founding documents. We will continue to invest in boosting American competitiveness globally, drawing dreamers and strivers from around the world. We will partner with any nation that shares our basic belief that the rules-based order must remain the foundation for global peace and prosperity. And we will continue to demonstrate how America's enduring leadership to address the challenges of today and tomorrow, with vision and clarity, is the best way to deliver for the American people.
This is a 360-degree strategy grounded in the world as it is today, laying out the future we seek, and providing a roadmap for how we will achieve it. None of this will be easy or without setbacks. But I am more confident than ever that the United States has everything we need to win the competition for the 21st century. We emerge stronger from every crisis. There is nothing beyond our capacity. We can do this—for our future and for the world.

Joe Biden,"October 16, 2022",Statement on World Food Day,"Today we reaffirm our commitment to ending hunger and malnutrition, creating a world in which no child has to go to bed hungry, no parent has to worry about how to feed their family, and no one has to face food insecurity.
The need for action has never been greater. This year, the world is facing an unprecedented level of food insecurity and humanitarian crises, worsened by the impacts of Russia's aggression against Ukraine on global food supplies. More than 300 million people are unable to access clean water, emergency medicine, shelter, and food without assistance. More than 100 million are forcibly displaced. And hundreds of millions more are experiencing hunger.
The United States will continue to step up and respond to this crisis. This year alone, we've committed over $9 billion in lifesaving humanitarian assistance to address growing needs here at home and around the world. Last month, at the White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health, I also reaffirmed our commitment to tackling the devasting threat of hunger and diet-related disease in the United States, a threat that hits vulnerable communities hardest and is being compounded by other challenges like COVID-19 and the climate crisis.
But food insecurity is a global challenge that requires a global solution. We must come together to support those who need it most. At the United Nations in May, the United States—joined by more than 100 other countries—launched the U.N. Roadmap for Global Food Security, which will strengthen global agriculture markets and meet the nutrition needs of millions. In September, the United States also convened a Global Food Security Summit on the margins of the U.N. General Assembly with partners around the world to renew our commitment to acting with urgency and responding with resolve to the growing food crisis.
Today, and every day, I am deeply grateful to people around the world who are doing their part to fight hunger, from holding food drives, innovating new agriculture solutions, to raising awareness of this growing challenge. We stand with you and will continue to act with urgency to get through this crisis and build a stronger, more sustainable food system for the future; the health, well-being, and stability of our world depends on it.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-world-food-day

Joe Biden,"October 27, 2022","Interview with Reshad Hudson of Nexstar TV in Syracuse, New York","HUDSON: Well, thank you -- thank you so much for your time. We'll go ahead and get started.
THE PRESIDENT: OK.
HUDSON: So, talk to me about the importance of today's announcement here in Syracuse, a place that's near and dear to your heart. What does this mean for chip manufacturing, not just here but across the country?
THE PRESIDENT: Look, one of the thins that's happened in the last 25 years, we've lost a manufacturing base in places that used to be proud producers of good jobs, whether it's in northeast Pennsylvania or here or all across the country. They've lost hope. And this brings back hope. You see -- you saw the reaction of the people out there. It wasn't so much the brilliance of the speeches, it was there's hope. We're back. And it's going to mean that we are going to be the leading chip manufacturer in the world. We invented these chips. We did the memory chips. We're the ones that did all the -- we, the United States. It's about time it came home.
HUDSON: I want to turn to the economy. Today's GDP report shows that the US economy grew 2.6 percent in the third quarter. What's your top-line reaction to that?
THE PRESIDENT: Top-line reaction is really good. There's nothing bad about the report. Nothing bad about the report. And the core inflation is actually down about 1.5. We're in a situation where we've created more jobs. We're in a situation where -- and look, the price of gasoline is falling. The price of gasoline in just in the last several months is down $1.26 or $1.27. And if the -- if the oil companies start to charge what they should be charging based on the cost of a barrel of oil, it'd be down to another $0.40. And I'm going to keep pushing as I get it down.
HUDSON: But what do you say to Americans? Because gas prices to many people are still too high, groceries are still expensive, what's your message to Americans?
THE PRESIDENT: My messages were getting them down. I told you I'd bring them down. We're bringing it down. I come from a family where ever gas prices went up or food prices went up, what happened? What happened was it was a conversation on the kitchen table. And we're doing a whole lot of other things. And by the way, the food prices -- the main driver of food prices is not the price of beef and eggs, etc., although they're up. It's packaged goods. Packaged goods. You're going to see people not buying Kellogg's Raisin Bran, which you're going to see them buy another raisin bran, which would be a dollar cheaper.
I mean, so what's happening is there is a real movement. We're better positioned than any country in the world, any major country in the world. And our economy is growing and is still in a place where it's leveling out in a rational means. The other thing is that I think you're going to see that people are looking to say, wow, price -- not only gas is down, but the price of I'm not getting charged for overdraft in my checks. I'm not getting charges, right?
There's all kinds of things we're doing. And one of the big things was we were able to -- what we did with the Inflation Reduction Act is we reduce the cost of a lot of things for people, things that they need, prescription drugs. You know, the idea that the most senior citizen is going to have to pay for their drugs per year is 2,000. Some are paying 13,000 14,000, 15,000 because of cancer drugs. That changes. Two thousand max. If, in fact, they raise the price like they did on 1,200 prescription drugs last year for pharma companies, guess what? If they raise it higher than the price of inflation, they've got to pay it back to Medicare. So, there's a lot going on to reduce people's burdens.
HUDSON: I want to turn to next month's election. You've referred to the midterm election as a choice rather than a referendum. Given record inflation, why should voters choose Democrats?
THE PRESIDENT: Because it's not record inflation anymore. I'm bringing it down. Look what we inherited. I inherited 69 percent unemployment. It's down to 3.5 percent. We have -- we lost 600 -- we lost hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs. I've -- we've created over 600,000 -- 700,000 manufacturing jobs. Things are moving. As that report shows that you have people who are now in a position where the combination of pay raises and job security, they're now in a better off, even with inflation, than they were before it. And inflation is coming down.
HUDSON: I want to ask you about the conflict in Russia -- or in Ukraine. Today, President Putin of Russia said that he has no intent to use chemical or nuclear weapons in Ukraine. Do you believe him?
THE PRESIDENT: I think he -- if he has no intention, why does he keep talking about it? Why is he talking about the -- the -- the ability to use a tactical nuclear weapon? He's been very dangerous in how he's approached this, and he should just get out -- he can end this all, get out of Ukraine.
HUDSON: And one on student loans, if I can. A judge has halted that -- your plan to relieve debt for millions of Americans that are struggling with student loans. What's your response to that?
THE PRESIDENT: We're going to win that case. I think in the next two weeks you're going to see those checks going out. That's my response. Thank you, man.
HUDSON: Thank you so much for your time, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT: Appreciate it. Thank you.
HUDSON: Good to see you.
THE PRESIDENT: You guys are all over, aren't you?
HUDSON: We are.
THE PRESIDENT: No, it's really quite -- I mean, I don't know whose idea it was, but it's a hell of an idea. Because you're going to --
HUDSON: [Inaudible] coast to coast.
THE PRESIDENT: No, I really mean it. It really matters. And -- and you're -- you're responding, in my view, how people live. They -- they don't have chance to sit in front of the news for, you know, 40, 50 minutes. You know, you're picking up what's happening around the world in -- in local communities.
HUDSON: Yes, sir.
THE PRESIDENT: Congratulations.
HUDSON: Thank you so much.
THE PRESIDENT: Thanks for having me. I appreciate it.
HUDSON: Thank you.

Joe Biden,"November 01, 2022",Joint Statement on the International Counter Ransomware Initiative,"The members of the International Counter Ransomware Initiative (CRI)—Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, Czech Republic, Dominican Republic, Estonia, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Lithuania, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Poland, Republic of Korea, Romania, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States, and Ukraine, and the European Union—met in Washington, DC on October 31-November 1, 2022. Previously participating states welcome Belgium as a new CRI member.
At the Second CRI Summit, members re-affirmed our joint commitment to building our collective resilience to ransomware, cooperating to disrupt ransomware and pursue the actors responsible, countering illicit finance that underpins the ransomware ecosystem, working with the private sector to defend against ransomware attacks, and continuing to cooperate internationally across all elements of the ransomware threat.
The work of the CRI supports the implementation of the endorsed UN framework for responsible state behavior in cyberspace, specifically the voluntary norm that States should cooperate ""to exchange information, assist each other, prosecute terrorist and criminal use of ICTs and implement other cooperative measures to address such threats."" The joint efforts of the CRI partners are also directly contributing to the implementation of the consensus conclusions and recommendations of the UN Expert Group to Conduct a Comprehensive Study on Cybercrime.
We are committed to using all appropriate tools of national power to achieve these goals and jointly committed to the following actions in support of this endeavor. We intend to:
Hold ransomware actors accountable for their crimes and not provide them safe haven;
Combat ransomware actors' ability to profit from illicit proceeds by implementing and enforcing anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) measures, including ""know your customer"" (KYC) rules, for virtual assets and virtual asset service providers;
Disrupt and bring to justice ransomware actors and their enablers, to the fullest extent permitted under each partner's applicable laws and relevant authorities; and
Collaborate in disrupting ransomware by sharing information, where appropriate and in line with applicable laws and regulations, about the misuse of infrastructure to launch ransomware attacks to ensure national cyber infrastructure is not being used in ransomware attacks.
Building our resilience to ransomware attacks requires effective policies and cooperation with trusted partners. CRI members are building a network of trusted partners to share and disseminate ransomware-related threat information to increase our collective resilience to ransomware attacks. To that end, we intend to establish a voluntary International Counter Ransomware Task Force (ICRTF) to develop cross-sectoral tools and cyber threat intelligence exchange to increase early warning capabilities and prevent attacks, as well as consolidate policy and best practice frameworks. The ICRTF expects to produce public reports on tools, tactics, and procedures to improve awareness to global stakeholders, promote and encourage membership of the CRI, and improve cyber hygiene across the board. The ICRTF intends to consider a model for ongoing collaboration with key private sector partners, including the establishment of an ancillary industry chapter that would be actively engaged with the work of the ICRTF.
We commit to establish processes to most effectively share information and analysis about specific strains of ransomware on an ongoing and enduring basis to improve our collective awareness and resilience.
CRI members are committed to taking action, in line with national law and policy, to disrupt and degrade the ransomware ecosystem and hold accountable criminal ransomware actors based on our collective knowledge, expertise, authorities, and capabilities. We intend to improve our comprehensive and holistic understanding of the strategies used by these criminal actors and the means by which their malicious activity can be identified and addressed in respective jurisdictions to improve our tools, relevant authorities, and capabilities to disrupt. We commit to work together to prioritize disruption targets to leverage the breadth of authorities and tools available to pursue hard and complex targets more effectively. We intend to increase the number and impact of our disruption actions so that ransomware actors are stopped in their tracks.
The CRI is committed not only to protecting ourselves and each other from ransomware, but also to helping other countries protect and disrupt so that ransomware is unable to gain traction worldwide. To that end, we intend to share technical and threat information and provide protection and remediation recommendations as broadly as possible.
Taking decisive steps to counter illicit finance that often enables and underpins the profitability of ransomware will also be key to our collective success. We resolve to work to establish mechanisms for notifying financial institutions and virtual asset platforms of ransomware payments so that funds can potentially be seized once they land in ransomware actors' accounts. We commit to working together to promote AML/CFT controls, including KYC policies and procedures within the virtual assets ecosystem to prevent its use for ransomware activity, such as through the implementation and enforcement of the Financial Action Task Force recommendations.
The private sector has a unique role to play in our counter-ransomware efforts, as their insights into the whereabouts and actions of ransomware actors from across the internet can effectively complement state capabilities in this realm. Private sector companies are often the victims of ransomware, and can be strong allies in defense and disruption. CRI members are working closely with the private sector to share information and set goals to prevent, reduce, and respond to ransomware threats. To further this collaboration, we have established a pilot information sharing platform to facilitate the exchange of information about ransomware actors and tools, tactics, techniques, and procedures amongst members, and eventually with the private sector. In addition, we also intend to develop a capacity-building tool to help countries utilize public-private partnerships to combat ransomware. We are continuing to work together to develop additional ways to collaborate to combat ransomware with the private sector, taking into account concerns private sector companies may raise.
Diplomatic engagement continues to be an essential tool for the international community's fight against ransomware attacks. We are committed to continuing to work together not only as the CRI, but also with other partners committed to fighting the scourge of ransomware, which has the power to impact us all, including through the Paris Call for Trust and Security for CRI members that support the Call. CRI members plan to work with the full spectrum of stakeholders to drive focused regional efforts and advance this agenda in appropriate multilateral frameworks to ensure the global community's shared resolve and preparedness to defeat these threats. We are also committed to leveraging capacity building programs in order to strengthen resilience, improve disruption capabilities, increase law enforcement capacities, and support the development of legal frameworks to combat ransomware in both CRI and other countries. In this regard, we intend to conduct bi-annual cyber exercises for the CRI Member States, which will also contribute to living toolkit of the ICRTF.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/joint-statement-the-international-counter-ransomware-initiative
Joe Biden,"November 13, 2022","Joint Statement by President Biden, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida of Japan, and President Yoon Suk Yeol of South Korea—Phnom Penh Statement on Trilateral Partnership for the Indo-Pacific","Today in Phnom Penh, Cambodia at the East Asia Summit, Prime Minister Kishida Fumio of Japan, President Yoon Suk Yeol of the Republic of Korea (ROK), and President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. of the United States reaffirmed our trilateral partnership guided by shared values, driven by innovation, and committed to shared prosperity and security. The Leaders commended the unprecedented level of trilateral coordination. Together, in their second trilateral meeting this year, the Leaders resolved to forge still-closer trilateral links, in the security realm and beyond.
The Leaders recognize that challenges of the 21st century require closer cooperation among Japan, the ROK and the United States. The United States' ironclad alliance commitments to the ROK and Japan and our close, enduring friendships are critical to the security and prosperity of our citizens, the region, and the world. Also, the Leaders concurred to work in a trilateral format at all levels of government to implement our approaches to the Indo-Pacific, a region of vital importance to global peace, security, and prosperity. The leaders will align our collective efforts in pursuit of a free and open Indo-Pacific, that is inclusive, resilient, and secure.
*** 
I. SECURE THE INDO-PACIFIC AND BEYOND 
The Leaders strongly condemn DPRK's unprecedented number of ballistic missile launches this year, including multiple ICBM launches, as well as a flurry of conventional military action that pose a grave threat to the peace and security on the Korean Peninsula and beyond. They reaffirm their commitment to the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula in accordance with United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions. The Leaders urge the DPRK to abide by its obligations under these resolutions as well as its previous commitments and agreements and call on all UN Member States to fully implement all UNSC resolutions. They reaffirm that a DPRK nuclear test would be met with a strong and resolute response from the international community. Japan, the ROK, and the United States will coordinate sanctions and work together to close gaps in the international sanctions regime to ensure all relevant sanctions are fully enforced. The path to dialogue remains open toward peaceful and diplomatic resolution with the DPRK, and the Leaders call on the DPRK to return to negotiations. To this end, President Biden and Prime Minister Kishida express support for the goal of the ROK's ""Audacious Initiative."" The leaders reaffirm a shared commitment to the immediate resolution of the abductions issue. Prime Minister Kishida and President Biden also express their support for the immediate release of the ROK citizens detained in the DPRK.
At the same time, the three countries will work together to strengthen deterrence. President Biden reiterated that the U.S. commitment to defend Japan and the ROK is ironclad and backed by the full range of capabilities, including nuclear. As the regional security environment grows more challenging, President Biden reaffirms that the U.S. commitment to reinforce extended deterrence to Japan and the ROK will only strengthen. Our recent joint exercises demonstrate our resolve to maintain peace and stability and defend the rules-based international order. The Leaders intend to share DPRK missile warning data in real time to improve each country's ability to detect and assess the threat posed by incoming missiles, a major step for deterrence, peace and stability.
The Leaders affirm their commitment to stand with Ukraine against Russia's unprovoked and brutal war of aggression against Ukraine that has shaken the foundation of the international order. They recognize that the Indo-Pacific cannot be stable and secure while aggression rages anywhere; threats to territorial integrity and sovereignty undermine the fabric of the entire international order. They share condemnation in the strongest possible terms of Russia's indiscriminate attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure and call for the immediate restoration of Ukraine's territorial integrity and sovereignty.
They condemn Russia's nuclear threats to coerce and intimidate and state unequivocally that any use of a nuclear weapon by Russia would be an act of hostility against humanity and Russia shall never use it under any circumstances. They share determination to ensure that no such acts are ever perpetrated anywhere including in the Indo-Pacific. In this regard, leaders also reject Russia's false claims that Ukraine is preparing a radiological ""dirty bomb.""
The Leaders strongly oppose any unilateral attempts to change the status quo in waters of the Indo-Pacific, including through unlawful maritime claims, militarization of reclaimed features, and coercive activities. The Leaders reiterated their firm commitment to the rule of law, including the freedom of navigation and overflight, consistent with the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Prime Minister Kishida, President Yoon, and President Biden emphasize that their basic positions on Taiwan remain unchanged, and reiterate the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait as an indispensable element of security and prosperity in the international community.
II. GROWING REGIONAL PARTNERSHIP 
The Leaders wholeheartedly reaffirm ASEAN centrality and unity and their support for the ASEAN-led regional architecture, including the East Asia Summit. They pledge to work closely with ASEAN partners to support robust implementation of the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific, as well as to continue to align their own regional strategies with it. They condemn the coup in Myanmar and the Myanmar military's brutal attacks on civilians, and commit to continue to support ASEAN's efforts and to take action to press for implementation of the ASEAN Five Point Consensus, the immediate cessation of violence, the release of all those who are wrongfully detained, unfettered countrywide humanitarian access, and a swift return to democracy.
The Leaders emphasized their joint commitment to the prosperity, security, sustainability, and resilience of the Mekong sub-region and support for collaboration and coordination as development partners and members of the Friends of the Mekong group. Japan, the ROK and the United States, are working to support the Mekong sub-region's economic and sustainable energy development, as well as promoting a water-secure and climate resilient Mekong River Basin. The Leaders reaffirm support for the sub-regional cooperation frameworks, including the Mekong River Commission (MRC) and Ayeyawady-Chao Phraya-Mekong Economic Cooperation Strategy (ACMECS) to ensure sustainable development and promote coordination among Mekong sub-region member countries and development partners.
The Leaders reaffirm their commitment to the Pacific Island countries, and the importance of working in genuine partnership with the Pacific in a transparent and effective manner, guided by the Pacific Island Forum's 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent. They commit to addressing key issues of concern for the Pacific Islands, including climate change; illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing; and economic development. They will look for opportunities to do so individually and together, including through the Partners in the Blue Pacific, and President Biden and Prime Minister Kishida welcome President Yoon's intent to join the partnership.
III. ECONOMIC PROSPERITY, TECHNOLOGY LEADERSHIP, AND TACKLING THE CLIMATE CRISIS 
The Leaders emphasize the importance of trilateral cooperation to strengthen the rules-based economic order to enhance economic security and prosperity throughout the Indo-Pacific and the world. Prime Minister Kishida, President Yoon and President Biden are pleased to launch a dialogue among the three governments on economic security. Our countries will stand together to promote and protect our technology leadership, for the benefit of the region and the world. They will continue to ensure secure and resilient supply chains, promote Data Free Flow with Trust, enhance trilateral, regional and like-minded cooperation on critical and emerging technologies, protect critical infrastructure and strengthen resilient and diverse supply chains of critical minerals to elevate environmental, social, and governance standards in the sector. The three countries will cooperate to advance innovation and deployment of emerging technologies including Artificial Intelligence, quantum information science and technology, biotechnology, and advanced communications, including use of open-RAN technology. They will coordinate implementation of their respective initiatives on semiconductor supply chain diversification, research and development, and workforce development. The three countries will stand as one against economic coercion and in favor of sustainable and transparent lending practices.
The Leaders commit to cooperate closely through the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF), based on the principles of openness, transparency, and inclusiveness. They concur inworking together to develop a comprehensive IPEF that will deepen economic engagement on priority issues, including the digital economy, resilient supply chains, clean energy, and other priorities geared toward promoting sustainable and inclusive economic growth. Prime Minister Kishida and President Yoon look forward to President Biden's hosting of APEC next year. To spur economic growth, the Leaders will take measures to empower women with equal opportunity and access to good jobs. The strength of our democracies and our economies depends on the full participation of women.
The three countries will also continue to help the Indo-Pacific region recover from COVID-19, and strengthen health security to prevent, prepare for, and respond to future pandemics. By aligning each of their efforts towards pandemic preparedness, they will work to ensure that the entire Indo-Pacific is better-equipped to confront future health threats.
The Leaders underscore the urgency of tackling the climate crisis, highlighted at the recent 27th Conference of the Parties to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP27). The three countries will work domestically and with partners to enhance global ambition to accelerate growth of the clean energy economy, avert the most catastrophic impacts of climate change, and help lower- and middle-income countries build resilience to climate impacts. All three countries joined the Net Zero Government Initiative at COP27, committing to achieving net-zero emissions from national government operations by no later than 2050. The leaders also highlight the importance of innovation and deployment of clean energy, such as nuclear power, next generation batteries, clean hydrogen and ammonia, and carbon capture and storage as essential to lowering emissions.

Joe Biden,"November 16, 2022",Joint Statement—G-20 Bali Leaders' Declaration,"Bali, Indonesia, 15-16 November 2022 
1. Fourteen years ago, the Leaders of the G20 met for the first time, facing the most severe financial crisis in our generation. We recognized, as large global economies, that collectively we carry responsibilities and that our cooperation was necessary to global economic recovery, to tackle global challenges, and lay a foundation for strong, sustainable, balanced, and inclusive growth. We designated the G20 the premier forum for global economic cooperation, and today we reaffirm our commitment to cooperate as we, once again, address serious global economic challenges.
2. We met in Bali on 15-16 November 2022, at a time of unparalleled multidimensional crises. We have experienced the devastation brought by the Covid-19 pandemic, and other challenges including climate change, which has caused economic downturn, increased poverty, slowed global recovery, and hindered the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.
3. This year, we have also witnessed the war in Ukraine further adversely impact the global economy. There was a discussion on the issue. We reiterated our national positions as expressed in other fora, including the UN Security Council and the UN General Assembly, which, in Resolution No. ES-11/1 dated 2 March 2022, as adopted by majority vote (141 votes for, 5 against, 35 abstentions, 12 absent) deplores in the strongest terms the aggression by the Russian Federation against Ukraine and demands its complete and unconditional withdrawal from the territory of Ukraine. Most members strongly condemned the war in Ukraine and stressed it is causing immense human suffering and exacerbating existing fragilities in the global economy - constraining growth, increasing inflation, disrupting supply chains, heightening energy and food insecurity, and elevating financial stability risks. There were other views and different assessments of the situation and sanctions. Recognizing that the G20 is not the forum to resolve security issues, we acknowledge that security issues can have significant consequences for the global economy.
4. It is essential to uphold international law and the multilateral system that safeguards peace and stability. This includes defending all the Purposes and Principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and adhering to international humanitarian law, including the protection of civilians and infrastructure in armed conflicts. The use or threat of use of nuclear weapons is inadmissible. The peaceful resolution of conflicts, efforts to address crises, as well as diplomacy and dialogue, are vital. Today's era must not be of war.
5. At today's critical moment for the global economy, it is essential that the G20 undertakes tangible, precise, swift and necessary actions, using all available policy tools, to address common challenges, including through international macro policy cooperation and concrete collaborations. In doing so, we remain committed to support developing countries, particularly the least developed and small island developing states, in responding to these global challenges and achieving the SDGs. In line with the Indonesian G20 Presidency theme—Recover Together, Recover Stronger—we will take coordinated actions to advance an agenda for a strong, inclusive and resilient global recovery and sustainable development that delivers jobs and growth. With the above in mind, we will:
Stay agile and flexible in our macro-economic policy responses and cooperation. We will make public investments and structural reforms, promote private investments, and strengthen multilateral trade and resilience of global supply chains, to support long-term growth, sustainable and inclusive, green and just transitions. We will ensure long-term fiscal sustainability, with our central banks committed to achieving price stability.
Protect macroeconomic and financial stability and remain committed to using all available tools to mitigate downside risks, noting the steps taken since the Global Financial Crisis to strengthen financial resilience and promote sustainable finance and capital flows.
Take action to promote food and energy security and support stability of markets, providing temporary and targeted support to cushion the impact of price increases, strengthening dialogue between producers and consumers, and increasing trade and investments for long-term food and energy security needs, resilient and sustainable food, fertilizer and energy systems.
Unlock further investments for low- and middle-income and other developing countries, through a greater variety of innovative financing sources and instruments, including to catalyze private investment, to support the achievement of the SDGs. We ask the Multilateral Development Banks to bring forward actions to mobilize and provide additional financing within their mandates, to support achievement of the SDGs including through sustainable development and infrastructure investments, and responding to global challenges.
Recommit to accelerate achievement of the SDGs, achieving prosperity for all through sustainable development.
6. We are deeply concerned by the challenges to global food security exacerbated by current conflicts and tensions. We therefore commit to taking urgent actions to save lives, prevent hunger and malnutrition, particularly to address the vulnerabilities of developing countries, and call for an accelerated transformation towards sustainable and resilient agriculture and food systems and supply chains. We commit to protect the most vulnerable from hunger by using all available tools to address the global food crisis. We will take further coordinated actions to address food security challenges including price surges and shortage of food commodities and fertilizers globally. Recalling the G20 efforts such as the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program, we welcome global, regional, and national initiatives in support of food security, and in particular note the progress made by the UN Secretary General's Global Crisis Response Group on Food, Energy and Finance, as well as the World Bank Group's and IMF's food security responses. We emphasize the importance of building on the G20 Matera Declaration, working together to sustainably produce and distribute food, ensure that food systems better contribute to adaptation and mitigation to climate change, and halting and reversing biodiversity loss, diversify food sources, promote nutritious food for all, strengthen global, regional, and local food value chains, and accelerate efforts to reduce food loss and waste. We will also implement the One Health approach, intensify research on food science and technology, and improve stakeholders' capacity along the food supply chains, particularly women, youth, smallholder, and marginal farmers as well as fishers.
7. We support the international efforts to keep food supply chains functioning under challenging circumstances. We are committed to addressing food insecurity by ensuring accessibility, affordability, and sustainability of food and food products for those in needs, particularly in developing countries and least developed countries. We reiterate our support for open, transparent, inclusive, predictable, and non-discriminatory, rules-based agricultural trade based on WTO rules. We highlight the importance of enhancing market predictability, minimizing distortions, increasing business confidence, and allowing agriculture and food trade to flow smoothly. We reaffirm the need to update global agricultural food trade rules and to facilitate trade in agricultural and food products, as well as the importance of not imposing export prohibitions or restrictions on food and fertilizers in a manner inconsistent with relevant WTO provisions. We are committed to sustained supply, in part based on local food sources, as well as diversified production of food and fertilizers to support the most vulnerable from the disruptions in food trade supply chain. We will avoid adversely impacting food security deliberately. We commit to facilitate humanitarian supplies for ensuring access to food in emergency situations and call on UN Member States and all relevant stakeholders with available resources to provide in-kind donations and resources to support countries most affected by the food crisis, as required and based on assessed needs by governments of affected countries. We continue to support the carve out of humanitarian activities from sanctions and call on all nations to support this aim, including through current efforts at the UN. We will continue to closely monitor the state of global food security and nutrition.
8. We welcome the Türkiye and UN-brokered two Istanbul Agreements signed on 22 July 2022 and consisting of the Initiative on the Safe Transportation of Grain and Foodstuffs from Ukrainian Ports (Black Sea Grain Initiative) and the Memorandum of Understanding between the Russian Federation and the Secretariat of the United Nations on Promoting Russian Food Products and Fertilizers to the World Markets, on the unimpeded deliveries of grain, foodstuffs, and fertilizers/inputs from Ukraine and the Russian Federation, to ease tension and prevent global food insecurity and hunger in developing countries. We emphasize the importance of their full, timely and continued implementation by all relevant stakeholders, as well as the UN Secretary-General's calls for continuation of these efforts by the Parties. In this context we highlight other efforts that ensure the flow of agri-food goods such as the EU Solidarity Lanes and the Russian donations of fertilizers facilitated by the World Food Programme. Moreover, we take note of various initiatives addressing food insecurity such as the Arab Coordination Group initiative.
9. We are committed to supporting the adoption of innovative practices and technologies, including digital innovation in agriculture and food systems to enhance productivity and sustainability in harmony with nature and promote farmers and fishers' livelihoods and increase income, in particular smallholders by increasing efficiency, and equal access to food supply chains. We will promote responsible investments in agricultural research and science and evidence-based approaches. We will continue to strengthen the Agricultural Market Information System (AMIS) as an early warning tool, to enhance food and fertilizer/inputs market transparency, reduce market uncertainties, and support coordinated policy responses for food security and nutrition, through the sharing of reliable and timely data and information.
10. We ask the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Bank Group (WBG) to share with us the results of their mapping exercises on food insecurity, which will be consolidated in the future with inputs from technical experts and other relevant international organizations, and will provide a systemic analysis of responses to address food security. This will identify any major gaps in global responses; examine food and nutrition variables and funding; examine the supply and demand of fertilizers; build on the G20 Agricultural Market Information System (AMIS); and identify any medium-term issues that require further technical and systemic analysis. The FAO and WBG will report back by the 2023 Spring Meetings.
11. We meet at a time of climate and energy crises, compounded by geopolitical challenges. We are experiencing volatility in energy prices and markets and shortage/disruptions to energy supply. We underline the urgency to rapidly transform and diversify energy systems, advance energy security and resilience and markets stability, by accelerating and ensuring clean, sustainable, just, affordable, and inclusive energy transitions and flow of sustainable investments. We stress the importance of ensuring that global energy demand is matched by affordable energy supplies. We reiterate our commitment to achieve global net zero greenhouse gas emissions/carbon neutrality by or around mid-century, while taking into account the latest scientific developments and different national circumstances. We call for continued support for developing countries, especially in the most vulnerable countries, in terms of providing access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy, capacity building, affordable latest technology within the public domain, mutually beneficial technology cooperation and financing mitigation actions in the energy sector.
12. We reaffirm our commitment to achieve SDG 7 targets and strive to close the gaps in energy access and to eradicate energy poverty. Recognising our leadership role, and guided by the Bali Compact and the Bali Energy Transition Roadmap, we are committed to finding solutions to achieve energy markets stability, transparency, and affordability. We will accelerate transitions and achieve our climate objectives by strengthening energy supply chain and energy security, and diversifying energy mixes and systems. We will rapidly scale up the deployment of zero and low emission power generation, including renewable energy resources, and measures to enhance energy efficiency, abatement technologies as well as removal technologies, taking into account national circumstances. We recognise the importance to accelerate the development, deployment and dissemination of technologies, and the adoption of policies, to transition towards low-emission energy systems, including by rapidly scaling up the deployment of clean power generation, including renewable energy, as well as energy efficiency measures, including accelerating efforts towards the phasedown of unabated coal power, in line with national circumstances and recognising the need for support towards just transitions. We will increase our efforts to implement the commitment made in 2009 in Pittsburgh to phase-out and rationalize, over the medium term, inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption and commit to achieve this objective, while providing targeted support for the poorest and the most vulnerable. We will strengthen international cooperation as well as relevant producer-consumer dialogues on securing energy affordability and accessibility by limiting volatility in energy prices and scaling up clean, safe, inclusive, and sustainable technologies, including developing regional energy interconnectivity. We are committed to promote investment in sustainable infrastructure and industry, as well as innovative technologies and a wide range of fiscal, market and regulatory mechanisms to support clean energy transitions, including, as appropriate, the use of carbon pricing and non-pricing mechanisms and incentives, while providing targeted support for the poorest and the most vulnerable.
13. Mindful of our leadership role, we reaffirm our steadfast commitments, in pursuit of the objective of UNFCCC, to tackle climate change by strengthening the full and effective implementation of the Paris Agreement and its temperature goal, reflecting equity and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities in light of different national circumstances. We will play our part fully in implementing the Glasgow Climate Pact and the relevant outcomes of previous COPs and CMAs, in particular COP 26, including the call to revisit and strengthen the 2030 targets in our NDCs, as necessary to align with the Paris Agreement. In this regard, we welcome enhanced climate actions resulting from the new or updated NDCs and invite parties to urgently scale up mitigation and adaptation ambition and means of implementation as well as make progress on loss and damage at COP 27 which is being held in Africa. Noting the IPCC assessments that the impact of climate change will be much lower at a temperature increase of 1.5°C compared with 2°C, we resolve to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C. This will require meaningful and effective actions and commitment by all countries, taking into account different approaches, through the development of clear national pathways that align long-term ambition with short and medium-term goals, and with international cooperation and support, including finance and technology, and sustainable and responsible consumption and production as critical enablers, in the context of sustainable development.
14. We welcome the progress to date towards achieving a Post 2020 Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF). We urge all parties and countries to finalize and adopt the GBF with the view of realizing of 2050 Vision of ""Living in harmony with Nature"" at the second part of COP15 CBD as a strong framework of action and accountability for halting and reversing biodiversity loss by 2030 and, as appropriate, to update National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans accordingly. We emphasize the importance of achieving and synergizing the objectives of the three Rio Conventions. We stress the need for clear and measurable goals and targets for biodiversity and means of implementation and accountability. We commit to strengthen actions to halt and reverse biodiversity loss by 2030 and call on CBD Parties to adopt an ambitious, balanced, practical, effective, robust and transformative post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework at COP-15 in Montreal. We urge for increased resource mobilization from all sources, including from countries and entities, to provide new and additional financial resources for the implementation of the GBF, once it is negotiated, including to help enable and support developing country parties, and for aligning private and public financial flows with biodiversity objectives. We will scale up efforts to combat biodiversity loss, deforestation, desertification, land degradation and drought, as well as restoring degraded land to achieve land degradation neutrality by 2030, and in support of the G20's ambition to reduce land degradation by 50% by 2040 on a voluntary basis. We recognize the effort made by a number of countries to ensure that at least 30% of global land and at least 30% of the global ocean and seas are conserved or protected by 2030 and we will help to make progress towards this objective in accordance with national circumstances. We commit to reduce environmental impacts by changing unsustainable consumption and production patterns as well as to enhance environmentally sound waste management including by preventing illegal cross-border traffic of waste.
15. We will step up efforts to halt and reverse biodiversity loss, including through Nature-based Solutions and Ecosystem-based Approaches, support climate mitigation and adaptation, enhance environmental conservation and protection, sustainable use and restoration, responding to natural disasters, reduce ecosystem degradation, enhance ecosystem services and to address issues affecting the marine and coastal environment. We will further promote sustainable development and lifestyles, resource efficiency and circular economy to increase sustainability and work together on scientific knowledge-sharing, raising awareness, and capacity building, particularly to advance on the ocean-based climate action. We are committed to ending illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. We welcome the WTO multilateral Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies and encourage its rapid entry into force. In line with the UNEA Resolution 5/14, we are committed to develop an international legally binding instrument on plastic pollution, including in the marine environment, with the ambition of completing the work by the end of 2024. We highlight the progress made and call on participating delegations to achieve an ambitious and balanced agreement without delay on an international legally binding instrument under UNCLOS on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction, as called for in the UNGA Resolution 69/292. We also acknowledge that ecosystems, including forests, seagrasses, coral reefs, wetland ecosystems in all their diversity, including peatlands and mangrove, support climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts.
16. We acknowledge the urgent need to strengthen policies and mobilize financing, from all sources in a predictable, adequate and timely manner to address climate change, biodiversity loss, and environmental degradation including significantly increasing support for developing countries. We recall and further urge developed countries to fulfil their commitments to deliver on the goal of jointly mobilizing USD 100 billion per year urgently by 2020 and through to 2025 in the context of meaningful mitigation action and transparency on implementation. We also support continued deliberations on an ambitious new collective quantified goal of climate finance from a floor of USD 100 billion per year to support developing countries, that helps in fulfilling the objective of the UNFCCC and implementation of the Paris Agreement. We emphasize the importance of transparency in the implementation of the pledges. We also recall the Glasgow Climate Pact urging developed countries to at least double their collective provision of climate finance for adaptation to developing countries, from 2019 levels, by 2025, in the context of achieving a balance between mitigation and adaptation in the provision of scaled up financial resource, recalling Article 9 of the Paris Agreement.
17. In the context of strengthening global efforts to reach the objective of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the goals of the Paris Agreement, as well as implementing the COP26 commitments, we reiterate that our policy mix toward carbon neutrality and net zero should include a full range of fiscal, market and regulatory mechanisms including, as appropriate, the use of carbon pricing and non-pricing mechanisms and incentives, and phase out and rationalize, over the medium term, inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption and commit to achieve this objective, while providing targeted support to the poorest and most vulnerable, and in line with national circumstances. We acknowledge the macro-economic risks stemming from climate change and will continue discussions on the costs and benefits of different transitions.
18. We are committed to take actions in support of orderly, just and affordable transitions to achieve the objectives of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in line with the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement as well as with the convention on Biological Diversity. We welcome the progress made across the G20, international organizations, other international networks and initiatives, and the private sector in addressing the priorities of the G20 Sustainable Finance Roadmap, which is voluntary and flexible in nature, and call for further efforts to advance the Roadmap's recommended actions that will scale up sustainability financing. We welcome the establishment of the Sustainable Finance Working Group's online dashboard and repository of relevant work, to illustrate ongoing and future progress made on the Roadmap, and encourage members to contribute on a voluntary basis, taking country circumstances into consideration. We endorse the 2022 G20 Sustainable Finance Report which articulates practical and voluntary recommendations for jurisdictions and relevant stakeholders in developing transition finance frameworks, improving the credibility of financial institutions' net zero commitments and scaling up sustainable finance instruments, with a focus on improving accessibility and affordability. We also welcome the valuable discussion during the Presidency's Forum on policy levers that incentivize financing and investment to support the transition.
19. We remain committed to promoting a healthy and sustainable recovery which builds towards achieving and sustaining Universal Health Coverage under the SDGs. While the COVID-19 pandemic is not over, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recently declared monkeypox as another Public Health Emergency International Concern (PHEIC), reinforcing that international health threats are ever present and that the G20 and broader global community must come together to improve our collective prevention, preparedness and response capabilities. We reaffirm the importance of strengthening of national health systems by putting people at the center of preparedness and equip them to respond effectively. We emphasize the need for equitable access to pandemic medical countermeasures, and welcome the efforts of ACT-A, and note that the results of the ACT-A external evaluations can be useful lessons for future discussions. We reaffirm our commitment to strengthen global health governance, with the leading and coordination role of WHO and support from other international organizations. We support the work of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Body (INB) that will draft and negotiate a legally binding instrument that should contain both legally binding and non-legally binding elements to strengthen pandemic PPR and the working group on the International Health Regulations that will consider amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR) (2005) mindful that the decision will be made by World Health Assembly.
20. The G20 High Level Independent Panel, as well as the WHO and World Bank have estimated there is an annual pandemic PPR financing gap of approximately USD 10 billion. As initiated by the Saudi Arabian G20 Presidency, the Italian G20 Presidency and continued by the Indonesian G20 Presidency, we welcome the provision of additional financial resources, to assist in financing critical gaps in implementing IHR (2005) and increase PPR capacities. In this regard, we welcome the establishment of a new Financial Intermediary Fund for Pandemic PPR (the 'Pandemic Fund') hosted by the World Bank. It aims to address critical pandemic PPR gaps and build capacity at national, regional and global levels, bring additionality in financial resources for pandemic PPR, catalyze complementary investments, and facilitate a coordinated and coherent approach to pandemic PPR strengthening. We welcome the Pandemic Fund's inclusive membership and representation from low- and middle-income countries, civil society organizations and donors, and acknowledge the WHO's technical expertise and central coordination role in this endeavor, which reflects its leadership role in the global health architecture. We appreciate the work of the Secretariat hosted by the World Bank, with the WHO as technical lead and as chair of the Technical Advisory Panel. We look forward to the launch of the Pandemic Fund's first call for proposals as soon as possible. We commit to increase the capacity of developing countries for pandemic PPR through the Pandemic Fund, and look forward to the stocktaking review of the Pandemic Fund at the end of its first year to draw on lessons learned and incorporate any changes needed to ensure it is operating in accordance with its governing documents and effective at filling critical PPR gaps, and that it continues to have a central coordination role for the WHO, maintains a strong connection to the G20, and is inclusive of the perspectives of low- and middle-income countries and additional non-G20 partners in its decision making. We commend the pledges by current donors, amounting to over USD 1.4 billion, and encourage additional voluntary pledges. We call on new donors to join the Pandemic Fund, as they are able to.
21. It is essential to continue collaboration between Finance and Health Ministries for pandemic PPR. We extend the mandate of the Task Force, and ask the Secretariat of the Task Force to work with the Task Force co-chairs, the incoming Indian G20 Presidency, the G20 Troika, and G20 members to agree on a Task Force workplan for 2023, taking into account a multi-year planning horizon. We thank the WHO for continuing to host the Secretariat, with support from the World Bank. In 2023 the Task Force will continue to be co-chaired by Indonesia and Italy, representing advanced and emerging economy perspectives, and will continue to draw on expertise of the WHO, International Financial Institutions and other relevant organizations, with the support of the 2023 Indian G20 Presidency. To expand the voice of lower income countries we invite key regional organizations to join the Task Force meetings, as appropriate. We will work closely with the WHO to ensure the Task Force continues to complement the global pandemic PPR architecture and there is no further duplication and fragmentation of the global health governance system. Delivering on the mandate from the G20 Rome Leaders' Declaration, in 2023 the Task Force will continue developing coordination arrangements between Finance and Health Ministries, and share best practices and experiences from past finance-health coordination in order to develop joint responses to pandemics, as appropriate. The Task Force will undertake work to better understand economic risks and vulnerabilities from pandemics, and how to mitigate them, with a focus on finance and health coordination in response to new pandemics, considering country-specific circumstances and recognizing the importance of further work on resource mobilization. We ask the Task Force to report back to Finance and Health Ministers in 2023 on its progress.
22. We recognize that the extensive COVID-19 immunization is a global public good and we will advance our effort to ensure timely, equitable and universal access to safe, affordable, quality and effective vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics (VTDs). Acknowledging the adoption of the Ministerial Declaration on the WTO Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic and Preparedness for Future Pandemics and the Ministerial Decision on the TRIPS Agreement at the WTO's 12th Ministerial Conference (MC12), we note that, no later than six months from the date of the Ministerial Decision on the TRIPS Agreement, WTO members will decide on its extension to cover the production and supply of COVID-19 diagnostics and therapeutics. We remain committed to embedding a multisectoral One Health approach and enhancing global surveillance, including genomic surveillance, in order to detect pathogens and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) that may threaten human health. To enable global pathogen surveillance as part of our commitment to implement the IHR (2005), we encourage sharing of pathogen data in a timely manner on shared and trusted platforms in collaboration with WHO. We encourage sharing of benefits arising from the utilization of pathogens consistent with applicable national laws.
23. We recognize the need for strengthening local and regional health product manufacturing capacities and cooperation as well as sustainable global and regional research and development networks to facilitate better access to VTDs globally, especially in developing countries, and underscore the importance of public-private partnership, and technology transfer and knowledge sharing on voluntary and mutually agreed terms. We support the WHO mRNA Vaccine Technology Transfer hub as well as all as the spokes in all regions of the world with the objective of sharing technology and technical know-how on voluntary and mutually agreed terms. We welcome joint research and joint production of vaccines, including enhanced cooperation among developing countries. We acknowledge the importance of shared technical standards and verification methods, under the framework of the IHR (2005), to facilitate seamless international travel, interoperability, and recognizing digital solutions and non-digital solutions, including proof of vaccinations. We support continued international dialogue and collaboration on the establishment of trusted global digital health networks as part of the efforts to strengthen prevention and response to future pandemics, that should capitalize and build on the success of the existing standards and digital COVID-19 certificates.
24. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the transformation of the digital ecosystem and digital economy. We recognize the importance of digital transformation in reaching the SDGs. We acknowledge that affordable and high-quality digital connectivity is essential for digital inclusion and digital transformation, while a resilient, safe and secure online environment is necessary to enhance confidence and trust in the digital economy. We recognize the importance of policies to create an enabling, inclusive, open, fair and non-discriminatory digital economy that fosters the application of new technologies, allows businesses and entrepreneurs to thrive, and protects and empowers consumers, while addressing the challenges, related to digital divides, privacy, data protection, intellectual property rights, and online safety. We acknowledge the importance to counter disinformation campaigns, cyber threats, online abuse, and ensuring security in connectivity infrastructure. We remain committed to further enable data free flow with trust and promote cross-border data flows. We will advance a more inclusive, human-centric, empowering, and sustainable digital transformation. We also reaffirm the role of data for development, economic growth and social well-being.
25. We encourage international collaboration to further develop digital skills and digital literacy to harness the positive impacts of digital transformation, especially for women, girls, and people in vulnerable situations, and further support efforts to develop reliable skills and literacy. We note the increasing demands for a workforce adept at utilizing emerging technologies, education and training, reskilling and upskilling to meet such demands. We also seek to increase connectivity by accelerating high capacity and secure infrastructure and provide more accessible and affordable resources and tools, while also improve the digital literacy skills of learners, teachers, school leaders, and other educational professional to ensure universal access to education, accelerate learning recovery and promote lifelong learning.
26. We found digital technology becomes the key for recovery and empowerment across various sectors, including in building a resilient and sustainable food system and agriculture, creating sustainable and decent jobs and human capacity development, supporting inclusive trade, industrialization and investment, increasing productivity, as well as opening up the potential of the future economy, especially for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) and start-ups. It is essential to ensure that no one is left behind in our effort to digitally transform our society, by involving all stakeholders, including the youth, women, business sector, audit institution, parliaments, scientists, and labours.
27. We support continued implementation of the G20 Roadmap for Enhancing Cross-Border Payments, including the future delivery of the initial estimates for key performance indicators and 2022 Progress Report that sets out priorities for the next stage of work. We encourage central banks, other public authorities and the payments industry to continue to work collaboratively on these important initiatives to enhance cross-border payments. We welcome the report by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) on interlinking payment systems and the role of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that was presented in a joint workshop by the Indonesian G20 Presidency in coordination with the BIS CPMI and the BIS Innovation Hub (BISIH) on cross-border payments and interoperability at the Festival Ekonomi Keuangan Digital Indonesia (FEKDI) 2022. We also welcome the joint report by the BIS CPMI, BISIH, IMF, and World Bank on options for access to and interoperability of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) for cross-border payments.
28. We endorse the G20 Financial Inclusion Framework on Harnessing Digitalization to Increase Productivity and Foster a Sustainable and Inclusive Economy for Women, Youth and MSMEs or Yogyakarta Financial Inclusion Framework guided by the G20 2020 Financial Inclusion Action Plan. To address digitalization and sustainable finance developments, and support financial inclusion and well-being, we endorse the updated G20/OECD High-Level Principles on Financial Consumer Protection and welcome the updated G20/OECD High-Level Principles on SME Financing.
29. To support our collective ambition to recover together, recover stronger, we commit to well-calibrated, well-planned, and well-communicated policies to support sustainable recovery, with due consideration to country-specific circumstances. We commit to mitigate scarring effects to support strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth. We will stay agile and flexible in our fiscal policy response, standing ready to adjust to the changing circumstances as needed. Temporary and targeted measures to help sustain the purchasing power of the most vulnerable and cushion the impact of commodity price increases, including energy and food prices, should be well designed to avoid adding to high inflationary pressures. We will continue to enhance macro policy cooperation, preserve financial stability and long-term fiscal sustainability, and safeguard against downside risks and negative spillovers. Macroprudential policies need to remain vigilant to guard against rising systemic risks as financial conditions tighten. Recognizing that many currencies have moved significantly this year with increased volatility, we reaffirm the commitments made on exchange rates by our Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors in April 2021. We also reiterate the importance of global cooperation and express our appreciation to the Indonesian G20 Presidency for its efforts to maintain an effective system of multilateralism through the G20.
30. G20 central banks are strongly committed to achieving price stability, in line with their respective mandates. To that end, they are closely monitoring the impact of price pressures on inflation expectations and will continue to appropriately calibrate the pace of monetary policy tightening in a data-dependent and clearly communicated manner, ensuring that inflation expectations remain well anchored, while being mindful to safeguard the recovery and limit cross-country spillovers. Central bank independence is crucial to achieving these goals and buttressing monetary policy credibility.
31. We are committed to the swift implementation of the OECD/G20 two-pillar international tax package. We welcome the progress on Pillar One. We also welcome progress on Pillar Two Global Anti-Base Erosion (GloBE) Model Rules, which pave the way for consistent implementation at a global level as a common approach, and we look forward to the completion of the GloBE Implementation Framework. We call on the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) to finalize Pillar One, including remaining issues and by signing the Multilateral Convention in the first half of 2023, and to complete the negotiations of the Subject to Tax Rule (STTR) under Pillar Two that would allow the development of a Multilateral Instrument for its implementation. We will work to strengthen the tax and development agenda in light of the July 2022 G20 Ministerial Symposium on Tax and Development, and we note the G20/OECD Roadmap on Developing Countries and International Tax. We support the progress made on implementing internationally agreed tax transparency standards, including regional efforts and welcome the signing of the Asia Initiative Bali Declaration in July 2022. We also welcome the Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework and the amendments to the Common Reporting Standard, both of which we consider to be integral additions to the global standards for automatic exchange of information. We call on the OECD to conclude the work on implementation packages, including possible timelines, and invite the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes to build on its commitment and monitoring processes to ensure widespread implementation of both packages by relevant jurisdictions.
32. We reaffirm our commitment to strengthening the long-term financial resilience of the international financial architecture, including by promoting sustainable capital flows, and developing local currency capital markets. We welcome the IMF's revised Institutional View on Liberalization and Management of Capital Flows and look forward to continued discussions with international organizations on the coherent implementation of international frameworks for the use of capital flow management measures, while being mindful of their original purpose. We look forward to further progress by the IMF in operationalizing the Integrated Policy Framework and welcome the report by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) on Macro-financial stability frameworks. We welcome continued exploration of how CBDCs could potentially be designed to facilitate cross-border payments, while preserving the stability and integrity of the international monetary and financial system. We welcome the successful completion of the G20 TechSprint 2022, a joint initiative with the BISIH, which has contributed to the debate on the most practical and feasible solutions to implement CBDCs. We reiterate our commitment to maintaining a strong and effective Global Financial Safety Net with a strong, quota-based and adequately resourced IMF at its center. We remain committed to revisiting the adequacy of quotas and will continue the process of IMF governance reform under the 16th General Review of Quotas, including a new quota formula as a guide, by 15 December 2023. We take note on the continuation of discussion of the IMF surcharge policy.
33. 1 We are committed to support all vulnerable countries to recover together, recover stronger. We welcome pledges amounting to USD 81.6 billion through the voluntary channelling of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) or equivalent contributions, and call for further pledges from all willing and able countries to meet the total global ambition of USD 100 billion of voluntary contributions for countries most in need. We welcome the operationalization of the Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST) to help eligible low-income countries, small states and vulnerable middle-income countries address longer-term structural challenges that pose macroeconomic risks, including those stemming from pandemics and climate change. We welcome the voluntary contributions to the RST and call for additional pledges and timely contributions to it and to the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT), especially for subsidy resources, to ensure a broad pool of contributors to meet funding needs. We are open to explore viable options for countries to voluntarily channel SDRs through Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs), while respecting national legal frameworks and the need to preserve the reserve assets status of SDRs. We will explore ways, including through balance sheet optimization measures, and other potential avenues, to maximize MDBs' development impact. We welcome early deliberations and urge MDBs to continue to discuss options for implementing the recommendations of the G20 Independent Review of MDBs' Capital Adequacy Frameworks within their own governance frameworks, and to deliver an update in Spring 2023. This will inform the ongoing development of a roadmap for the implementation of the recommendations, while safeguarding MDBs' long-term financial sustainability, robust credit ratings and preferred creditor status. We acknowledge the concluding report on the 2020 Shareholding Review of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and look forward to the 2025 Shareholding Review. At this challenging juncture, we reiterate our commitment to step up our efforts to implement the Common Framework for Debt Treatment beyond the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) in a predictable, timely, orderly and coordinated manner. We welcome progress in this regard, including the provision of financing assurances for Zambia. We welcome the conclusion of the debt treatment to Chad and encourage the timely conclusion of the debt treatment for Zambia by early 2023. We also encourage the conclusion of the debt treatment for Ethiopia under an IMF-supported program. We are concerned about the deteriorating debt situation in some vulnerable middle income countries. This could be addressed by multilateral coordination that involves all official and private bilateral creditors to take swift action to respond to their requests for debt treatments. We stress the importance for private creditors and other official bilateral creditors to commit to providing debt treatments on terms at least as favourable to ensure fair burden sharing in line with the comparability of treatment principle. We reaffirm the importance of joint efforts by all actors, including private creditors, to continue working toward enhancing debt transparency. We welcome the efforts of private sector lenders who have already contributed data to the joint Institute of International Finance (IIF)/OECD Data Repository Portal, and continue to encourage others to also contribute on a voluntary basis.
34. In the face of a more challenging global economic and financial outlook, we underline the need to reinforce global financial system resilience and ask the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and IMF to continue their monitoring efforts. We commit to sustaining global financial stability, including through continued coordination of policy measures and implementation of international standards. We welcome the FSB's final report on financial sector exit strategies and scarring effects of COVID-19 and its conclusions regarding financial stability issues by the end of 2022. We strongly support global policy actions to increase resilience, in particular against cross-border spillovers, including by addressing the identified structural vulnerabilities in non-bank financial intermediation (NBFI) from a systemic perspective. To this end, we welcome the FSB's NBFI progress report with policy proposals to address systemic risk in NBFI, including in open-ended funds. We welcome the report by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), the BIS Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI), and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) on the review of margining practices. We support taking forward the implementation of the FSB updated Roadmap for addressing climate-related financial risks which complements the G20 Sustainable Finance Roadmap. Globally consistent data are needed in order to effectively address climate-related financial risks. We look forward to the finalization of standards by the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) in support of globally consistent, comparable and reliable climate-related financial disclosures, and its work beyond climate, and we welcome the efforts to achieve interoperability across disclosure frameworks. We welcome the FSB progress report on achieving consistent and comparable climate-related financial disclosures and the final report on supervisory and regulatory approaches to climate-related risks. We welcome the report by the FSB and the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) on climate-scenario analysis by jurisdictions.
35. We welcome ongoing work by the FSB and international standard setters to ensure that the crypto-assets ecosystem, including so-called stablecoins, is closely monitored and subject to robust regulation, supervision, and oversight to mitigate potential risks to financial stability. We welcome the FSB's proposed approach for establishing a comprehensive international framework for the regulation of crypto-asset activities based on the principle of 'same activity, same risk, same regulation'. We welcome the FSB consultative report on the review of its high-level recommendations for the regulation, supervision and oversight of ""global stablecoin"" arrangements. We also welcome the FSB consultation report on promoting international consistency of regulatory and supervisory approaches to crypto-assets activities and markets. It is critical to build public awareness of risks, to strengthen regulatory outcomes and to support a level playing field, while harnessing the benefits of innovation. We welcome the final guidance by the BIS CPMI and IOSCO which confirms that the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures apply to systematically important stablecoin arrangements. We welcome the FSB consultative report on achieving greater convergence in cyber incidents reporting, and look forward to the final report. We welcome the results of the second phase of the Data Gaps Initiative (DGI-2) and will continue to work with partners in addressing the identified remaining challenges. We welcome the workplan on the new Data Gaps Initiative (DGI) prepared by the IMF, FSB and the Inter-Agency Group on Economic and Financial Statistics (IAG) in collaboration with participating members. We ask the IMF, the FSB and the IAG to begin work on filling these data gaps and report back on progress in the second half of 2023, noting that the targets are ambitious and delivery will need to take into account national statistical capacities, priorities, and country circumstances as well as avoiding overlap and duplication at international level. We welcome the progress of work on the review of the G20/OECD Principles of Corporate Governance, including the second report and the ongoing public consultation, and look forward to further updates on the review.
36. We reaffirm that the rules-based, non-discriminatory, free, fair, open, inclusive, equitable, sustainable and transparent multilateral trading system (MTS), with the WTO at its core, is indispensable to advancing our shared objectives of inclusive growth, innovation, job creation and sustainable development in an open and interconnected world as well as to supporting the resilience and recovery of a global economy under strain due to COVID-19 and global supply chain disruption. We agree that reforming the WTO is key in strengthening trust in the MTS. We will continue to ensure a level playing field and fair competition to foster a favourable trade and investment environment for all. We note the importance of the contribution of the MTS to promote the UN 2030 Agenda and its SDGs. Commending the successful conclusion of the 12th WTO Ministerial Conference (MC12), we commit to seize and advance the positive momentum by engaging in active, constructive, pragmatic, and focused discussions on WTO reform to improve all its functions, including reform of the dispute settlement mechanism, on the path leading to the MC13.
37. We are committed to reinforce international trade and investment cooperation to address supply chain issues and avoid trade disruptions. We believe that trade and climate/environmental policies should be mutually supportive and WTO consistent and contribute to the objectives of sustainable development. We also recognise the importance of inclusive international cooperation on digital trade. We recognize the need to promote value addition through sustainable and inclusive investment in highly productive sectors such as downstream manufacturing, digital trade, and services, and to foster linkages between foreign investors and local enterprises particularly MSMEs. We note the initiative from the Indonesian Presidency to hold discussions on policy coherence between trade, investment and industry, and to continue addressing industry-related issues in the broader G20 process, as appropriate.
38. We recognize the importance of revitalizing infrastructure investment in a sustainable, inclusive, accessible, and affordable way. We endorse the voluntary and non-binding G20/GI Hub Framework on How to Best Leverage Private Sector Participation to Scale Up Sustainable Infrastructure Investment which will consider country circumstances, and which will complement investment from other sources, including public investment and finance provided by MDBs. We note the Outcome Document from the 2022 G20 Infrastructure Investors Dialogue. To enhance social inclusion and address subnational disparities, we endorse the G20-OECD Policy Toolkit on Mobilizing Funding and Financing for Inclusive and Quality Infrastructure Investment in Regions and Cities, prepared with the support of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). We note the Preliminary Findings Report on Gender Inclusive Approaches in Private Participation in Infrastructure in promoting gender considerations during the infrastructure lifecycle and look forward to the final report. We endorse the InfraTracker 2.0 which will enable both the public and private sectors towards transformative infrastructure investment post-COVID-19, by providing insights into long-term infrastructure strategies and plans. To narrow the digital divide, we endorse the G20 Compendium of Case Studies on Digital Infrastructure Finance: Issues, Practices and Innovations. We endorse the Quality Infrastructure Investment (QII) Indicators and associated guidance note, developed for the G20, which are voluntary and non-binding and consider country circumstances, and we look forward to further discussions on how the QII indicators can be applied. We welcome progress made towards developing a possible new governance model for the Global Infrastructure Hub (GI Hub) and ask that principles to guide the process be finalized as soon as possible.
39. The rise of automation and digital technologies are reshaping the world of work, presenting both opportunities and challenges. Adding to the situation, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated pre-existing inequalities in many countries and continues to disproportionately affect women, youth, older workers, persons with disabilities and migrant workers. We underline that it remains our utmost priority to mitigate the adverse impact of the current trends on the labour market, reduce inequalities while responding effectively to the opportunities that automation and digital technologies present and promote gender equality. We remain committed to the promotion of decent work and the elimination of child and forced labour.
40. We reaffirm our commitment to support the full inclusion of migrants, including migrant workers, refugees, in our recovery efforts, in the spirit of international cooperation and in line with national policies, legislation, and circumstances, ensuring full respect for their human rights and fundamental freedoms regardless of their migration status. We also recognize the importance of preventing irregular migration flows and the smuggling of migrants, as part of a comprehensive approach for safe, orderly and regular migration, while responding to humanitarian needs and the root causes of displacement. We support strengthening cooperation between countries of origin, transit, and destination. We will continue the dialogue on migration and forced displacement in future Presidencies.
41. We remain committed to a human-centred, inclusive, fair, sustainable approach that leads to greater social justice, decent work, and social protection for all. We will continue our work to integrate persons with disabilities, women, and youth across sectors and levels in pursuit of an inclusive labour market. We are resolved to promote sustainable development of human capacity, labour markets, and productivity, including through community-based vocational education and training, to advance job creation through entrepreneurship, to empower MSMEs, and to accelerate our efforts to foster and adapt labour protection for all workers, including those in the informal sector. We will maximize our approach to skills development to respond effectively to the needs of the labour market, with the involvement of social partners. We will accelerate progress towards the Antalya Youth Goal, as well as universal social protection for all by 2030.
42. We are deeply concerned that multidimensional crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as lack of fiscal space and unequal access to finance and technology, are posing significant challenges towards realizing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda in a timely manner. We will demonstrate leadership and take collective actions to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and accelerate the achievement of the SDGs by 2030 and address developmental challenges by reinvigorating a more inclusive multilateralism and reform aimed at implementing the 2030 Agenda.
43. In this regard, we will strengthen inclusive and sustainable recovery and build resilience in all developing countries, including SIDS in the Pacific and Caribbean and LDCs, through ambitious and concrete actions. We also reiterate our continued support to Africa, including through the G20 Compact with Africa and the G20 Initiative on Supporting Industrialization in Africa and LDCs. We will focus on MSMEs, adaptive social protection, green economy and blue economy. We recognise the need for partnership to promote mutually beneficial technology cooperation and share good practice, as well as the need for inclusive and quality infrastructure investment for stronger recovery and resilience. We underscore the need to address the financing gap towards implementation of the 2030 Agenda, through enhancing innovative financing mechanisms, including blended finance, while noting the importance of transparency and mutual accountability. We take note of initiatives such as the Coalition for Disaster Resilience Infrastructure and the Global Blended Finance Alliance, and welcome the Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction. We look forward to the success of the SDGs Summit in 2023.
44. Access to education is a human right and a pivotal tool for inclusive and sustainable economic recovery. We welcome the outcome of the Transforming Education Summit. We will act in solidarity in particular with developing countries to rebuild more resilient, tech-enabled, accessible, and effective education systems. We will empower relevant actors within and beyond G20 to remove barriers to education, improve teaching and learning environments, and support transitions within and across all stages of education, with emphasis on women and girls. We also underscore the importance of learners' well-being in their preparation for work and meaningful participation and contribution to more equitable, inclusive and sustainable society. We reaffirm the importance of Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) and our commitment to SDG4 to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and training. We are committed to promoting lifelong learning at all levels amidst the changing nature of work and encourage partnership in this regard.
45. We acknowledge the importance of research and innovation in sustainable resource utilization in various sectors, especially in the midst of health, climate, food and energy crises. We welcome research and innovation collaboration for the conservation of biodiversity and its use to support the sustainable development including green and blue economy. We also promote inclusive collaborations to further research and innovation, as well as promoting researchers' international mobility.
46. As women and girls continue to be disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and other crises, we reaffirm our commitment to put gender equality and women's empowerment at the core of our efforts for an inclusive recovery and sustainable development. We commit to implement the G20 Roadmap Towards and Beyond the Brisbane Goal foster financial inclusion and access to digital technologies, including to address the unequal distribution in paid and unpaid care and domestic work, with a focus on closing the gender pay gap. We commit to the elimination of gender-based violence, the enhancement of social, health, care and educational services, and the overcoming of gender stereotypes. We will continue to advance women's and girls' equal access to inclusive and quality education, including participations in STEM education, women entrepreneurship through MSMEs, and women's and girls' access in leadership positions. We will promote quality of life for women in rural areas and women with disabilities. We welcome the work that has been done by the EMPOWER Alliance and its engagement with the G20, and support the future convening of G20 Ministerial Conference on Women's Empowerment.
47. We reaffirm the important role of tourism for global recovery, and the community-based approach for rebuilding a more human-centred, inclusive, sustainable, and resilient tourism sector. We acknowledge the vital importance of strengthening safe international mobility and connectivity and seamless post-Covid travel to enable tourism recovery. We further recognize that creative economy, which involve knowledge-based economy, human creativity, and intellectual property rights, contributes to improving the resiliency of tourism local communities and MSMEs through human capital development, digital transformation, innovation, public-private partnerships, sustainable preservation of natural and cultural heritage, and innovative financing while retaining their significant commercial and cultural values.
48. We reaffirm the role of culture as an enabler and driver for sustainable development with intrinsic value beyond its social and economic benefits. We are committed to develop policies that draw on cultural diversity as a resource for sustainable living and promote an inclusive and equitable ecosystem at all levels that values the contribution of those working in the culture, arts and heritage sectors. We will respect, protect and preserve the cultural heritage of our peoples, including local communities and indigenous peoples, as applicable. We support public incentives and sustainable investments from the private sector to strengthen the cultural economy. We will safeguard cultural heritage as well as fighting illicit trafficking of cultural property and promoting restitution to its rightful owner/countries of origin, in accordance with the relevant UNESCO Conventions and national laws.
49. We will continue to lead by example through strengthening and implementing our obligations and commitments to anti-corruption efforts including through legally binding instruments, while renewing our commitment to zero tolerance for corruption. We emphasize the importance of transparency and accountability for both public and private sector as a crucial part of a collective recovery effort. We underscore the important role of auditing as well as public participation and anti-corruption education in preventing and tackling any form of corruption. We recall our commitments and call on all countries to criminalise bribery, including bribery of foreign public officials, and effectively prevent, combat, detect, investigate, prosecute and sanction bribery. We will further work to strengthen international cooperation and legal frameworks to combat economic crimes including corruption related to organized crime and money laundering, including, on a voluntary basis, through existing networks and initiatives such as GlobE and the G20 Denial of Entry Experts Network. We will share information on our actions towards criminalising foreign bribery and enforcing foreign bribery legislation in line with Article 16 of UNCAC, and look forward to enlarging participation to the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention, as appropriate. We reaffirm our commitment to deny safe haven to corruption offenders and their assets, in accordance to domestic laws. We also recognize the importance of mitigating corruption risk in all sectors. We will further strengthen our engagement with and promote active participation by stakeholders such as academia, civil society, media and the private sector, including to advance a culture of integrity.
50. We recognize the need for the international community to step up their efforts to effectively combat money laundering, terrorism financing, and proliferation financing. We reaffirm our commitment to delivering the strategic priorities of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and its FATF Style Regional Bodies (FSRBs) to lead global action to respond to these threats. We welcome the initiative by the FATF to promote implementation of international standards on virtual assets, in particular the ""travel rule"", and transparency of beneficial ownership, and acknowledge their role in the fight against systemic corruption and environmental crimes, which gravely impact economies and societies. We support the ongoing work of the FATF to enhance global efforts to seize criminal proceeds and return funds to victims and states in line with domestic frameworks. We encourage all G20 members to strengthen collaboration to adopt and effectively implement the FATF standards.
51. We welcome the Indonesian Presidency's efforts to compile a wide array of national submissions and international coordinated collaborations from G20 members, invited countries, and regional and international organizations. These have been presented in the ""G20 Action for Strong and Inclusive Recovery"", as annexed. We call for further concrete actions to impart greater momentum and impact to the efforts of international community to recover together and recover stronger.
52. We welcome the outcomes of various G20 working groups and Ministerial meetings. We appreciate and thank Indonesia for its Presidency and for successfully hosting the Bali G20 Leaders' Summit and for its contribution to the G20 process.

Joe Biden,"November 23, 2022",Statement on the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women,"This year, on the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women—which kicks off the global 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence—we remember that gender-based violence continues to impact millions of women, girls, and marginalized people around the world, particularly in areas of democratic backsliding, conflict, and instability. The United States will not stand by as they face pain and suffering. Today we stand in solidarity with the women of Ukraine suffering Russia's brutal and unjust war, where we are once more seeing rape used as a weapon. We stand with the women of Russia, against whom domestic violence was partially decriminalized in 2017. We stand with the women of Iran, who are facing down violence and oppression to demand their human rights and fundamental freedoms. And we stand with the estimated one in three women around the world who will experience physical violence, rape, or stalking at some point in their lifetimes.
For all our progress on this issue, these numbers remain an outrage. And, as is too often the case, women and girls from historically marginalized communities—including people of color, people with disabilities, and people who identify as LGBTQI+—are disproportionately affected. We must recommit ourselves to ending violence against women and girls in all their diversity, wherever and whenever it occurs. Ending this scourge is a moral imperative, and it is in our strategic interest to strengthen security and stability for us all. When women are safe and fully integrated into their societies, everyone does better.
Ending violence against women has been the cause of my life. As a Senator, I wrote and championed the first Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) and then worked for decades to strengthen VAWA's support to survivors and increase prevention efforts. This past March, as President, I had the honor of signing into law the strongest survivor protections to date through the Violence Against Women Act Reauthorization Act of 2022. Under the leadership of the Gender Policy Council, my administration is putting gender equality and equity at the heart of all that we do. And, over the last year, we've redoubled our efforts to address gender-based violence and abuse, including implementing historic military justice reform, taking targeted actions to support Native survivors and LGBTQI+ survivors, combatting technology-facilitated gender-based violence, advancing efforts to prevent domestic violence homicides and gun violence, and increasing support to address conflict-related sexual violence.
We still have more to do. No one should live under the threat of violence. No one should go through their life fearing violence, abuse, and persecution. That is our ultimate goal, and my administration will continue to lead this work at home and around the world.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-the-international-day-for-the-elimination-violence-against-women
Joe Biden,"November 23, 2022",Statement Honoring the Victims of the Ukrainian Holodomor,"Even as the brave Ukrainian people continue to defend their democracy and freedom from Russia's brutal aggression, we pause to also honor the victims of past injustices and horrors inflicted on Ukraine.
This November marks the anniversary of the Holodomor—""death by hunger."" During his regime, Joseph Stalin imposed harsh and repressive policies on Ukraine, including creating a deliberate famine in 1932-33 that caused millions of innocent Ukrainian women, men, and children to perish. We commemorate all the lives lost in this senseless tragedy, and we pay tribute to the resilience of the Ukrainian people who endured devastation and tyranny to ultimately create a free and democratic society.
This month, we remember the victims of the Holodomor. We reaffirm our steadfast commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. And we honor the brave Ukrainian people who continue to courageously resist Russia's assault on their democracy.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-honoring-the-victims-the-ukrainian-holodomor
Joe Biden,"December 01, 2022",Joint Statement by President Biden and President Emmanuel Macron of France,"Today, the President of the United States and the President of the French Republic met in Washington during the first State Visit of the Biden-Harris Administration. This special occasion reaffirms a relationship founded on more than two centuries of friendship, economic partnership, defense and security cooperation, and shared commitment to democratic principles, values, and institutions. France is the United States' oldest ally, and while our relationship is rooted in history, it is oriented squarely toward the future. Building on their joint statement of October 29, 2021, the leaders outlined a shared vision to strengthen security and increase prosperity worldwide, combat climate change, build greater resilience to its effects, and advance democratic values.

They also intend to continue providing robust direct budget support for Ukraine, and to urge the international financial institutions to scale up their financial support.
The United States and France reiterate their duty to uphold applicable international obligations and the principles and purposes of the UN Charter. They also reiterate their steadfast resolve to hold Russia to account for widely documented atrocities and war crimes, committed both by its regular armed forces and by its proxies, including mercenary entities such as Vagner and others, through support for international accountability mechanisms, including the International Criminal Court, the Ukrainian prosecutor general, UN Human Rights Council Commission of Inquiry, and the OSCE Moscow Mechanism, sanctions, and other means.
The United States and France remain committed to addressing the wider effects of Russia's war, including working with the international community to build greater resilience to food and energy disruptions.
Indo-Pacific 
The United States and France, two nations of the Indo-Pacific, are strengthening their partnership in the Indo-Pacific region to advance prosperity, security, and shared values based on a rules-based international order, transparent governance, fair economic practices, and respect for international law, including freedom of navigation. The United States and France intend to expand their regional diplomatic, development, and economic engagement with a view to building resilience in the Pacific Islands. They also intend to increase practical coordination in the region on maritime security. The United States intends to increase its support and material contributions to air and maritime deployments conducted by France and other European nations in the region.
The United States and France will continue to coordinate on our concerns regarding China's challenge to the rules-based international order, including respect for human rights, and to work together with China on important global issues like climate change. The Presidents reaffirm the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. Both leaders also strongly condemn the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's (DPRK) unprecedented number of unlawful ballistic missile tests this year that violate multiple UN Security Council resolutions and pose a threat to regional peace and stability, and are committed to continue coordination at the UN Security Council to address DPRK violations.

They will continue engaging with partners in the Middle-East and follow up on the August 2021 Baghdad Conference.
The Presidents also express their respect for the Iranian people, in particular women and youth, who are bravely protesting to gain the freedom to exercise their human rights and fundamental freedoms, which Iran itself has subscribed to and is violating.
They remain determined to ensure that Iran can never develop or acquire a nuclear weapon. France and the United States continue to work with other international partners to address Iran's nuclear escalation, its insufficient cooperation with the IAEA, including on serious and outstanding issues relating to Iran's legal obligations under its Non-Proliferation Treaty Safeguards Agreement, and its destabilizing activities in the Middle East, most urgently its transfers of missiles and drones, including to non-state actors. These transfers can threaten key Gulf partners and stability and security in the region, contravene international law, and now contribute to Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine. France and the United States will work with partners to enhance cooperation regarding enforcement of relevant UN Security Council resolutions and countering these activities. They will undertake joint efforts aimed at further strengthening the international framework constraining the proliferation of Iranian missile and unmanned aerial vehicle technologies in the region and beyond and in enhancing practical efforts to counter this proliferation.
Nuclear Deterrence, Nonproliferation, and Disarmament 
The United States and France reaffirm that nuclear deterrence remains essential for their national security and a core component of NATO's overall capabilities for deterrence and defense. They reaffirm that the fundamental purpose of NATO's nuclear capability is to preserve peace, prevent coercion, and deter aggression against the Alliance. They reaffirm the importance of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and their opposition to the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, which does not reflect the increasingly challenging international security environment and is at odds with the existing non-proliferation and disarmament architecture. The United States and France also reaffirm support for their Mutual Defense Agreement and intend to expand their technical cooperation on a wide range of strategic risk reduction topics.
Economy, Emerging Technologies, Trade, and Supply Chains 
The bilateral investment and trade relationship between our nations is longstanding and deep, creating significant jobs and prosperity for both.

France and the United States plan to continue pursuing their efforts to support the phase out of coal as soon as possible, both domestically and in emerging economies. They plan to increase their support towards those countries that host the most critical reserves of irrecoverable carbon and important biodiversity. France and the United States will also work together to protect rainforests and to tackle deforestation and illegal forest clearances, including through the One Forest Summit that will be held early 2023 in Libreville. They will work together to ensure better ocean protection in view of the next UN Ocean Conference that will be held in France in 2025 and are fully mobilized at the highest level for the conclusion of the UN Treaty on the protection of the High Sea in 2023.
Strengthening the International Financial Architecture 
France and the United States intend to work jointly to strengthen the international financial architecture to support the most vulnerable countries in a context of multiple shocks, from the COVID-19 pandemic to the repercussions of Russia's war against Ukraine and the accelerating effects of climate change. The United States and France will also cooperate closely to reduce the financing gap in emerging and developing economies in order to foster sustainable pathways towards net zero. This includes working together to ensure that multilateral systems are delivering timely debt relief from all key creditors to countries in distress.
As two major shareholders, France and the United States reaffirm their determination to drive an evolution of the multilateral development banks, starting with the World Bank, to better address global challenges and support private investment in emerging and developing markets. France and the United States reiterate their commitment to help meet the global ambition of $100 billion U.S. dollars in voluntary contributions as soon as possible for countries most in need, including through the channeling of special drawing rights.
The Presidents affirm their willingness to cooperate to raise the level of ambition on these issues, including at the summit to be held in Paris in June 2023.
Global Health and Food Security 
It is fitting that this State Visit coincides with World AIDS Day, given our nations' leadership in turning the tide of the AIDS pandemic and as the most recent hosts of the replenishments for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. Learning from the COVID-19 pandemic, France and the United States plan to intensify their cooperation on global health security and pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response, including by supporting the newly established Pandemic Fund, bolstering national health systems, training health workers, and strengthening multilateral institutions including the World Health Organization. The United States and France intend to continue working together to respond to regional and global food security challenges. They also intend to promote and safeguard an open and transparent agricultural market, to invest in resilient food systems, and to refrain from imposing any unnecessary trade obstacles.
Democracy and Human Rights 
The Presidents recognize that strengthening democratic values and respect for universal human rights is essential to meeting the unprecedented challenges of our time. They reinforce the commitments they each made at the first Summit for Democracy to support free and independent media, tackle the proliferation of surveillance technologies and disinformation, bolster democratic reformers, and advance technology for democracy. The United States and France intend to strengthen and expand the Freedom Online Coalition, advance the commitments made in the Christchurch Call to Action to counter the dissemination of terrorist and violent extremist content online to better protect human rights both on- and off-line, and plan to promote the principles outlined in the Declaration for the Future of the Internet.
Cyber and Disinformation 
The Presidents renew their determination to work alongside partners and stakeholders to advance cybersecurity and to uphold international law and established, non-binding global peacetime norms in cyberspace, including through the Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace and through an ambitious United Nations Program of Action. The United States and France plan to hold their fifth U.S.-France Cyber Dialogue in early 2023. They also intend to strengthen bilateral coordination in combating foreign manipulation of information online. They reaffirm their support for independent media at the international level, including through the International Fund for Public Interest Media (IFPIM) to be hosted in Paris. The United States and France underscore the importance of last month's Counter Ransomware Initiative Summit where they and 35 other participants reaffirmed their cooperation to disrupt ransomware globally. Recognizing the growing use of commercial space capabilities to support critical functions and the increasing cybersecurity threats to those capabilities, France and the United States intend to work together to strengthen the cybersecurity of these space systems.
Education and Science Partnerships 
The United States and France are committed to deepening their educational cooperation with the shared objective of fostering greater equity and access to excellence in education. Because the power of language and international mobility can lead to meaningful partnerships, they intend to undertake new initiatives to foster language learning, such as facilitating French and English language teaching assistant exchanges between their respective countries. They welcome and support the French for All initiative, which promotes greater and more equitable access to French language education and the benefits of bilingualism for young learners across the United States.
The United States and France aim for a robust network of educational partnerships and exchange programs to reach the next generation of transatlantic leaders who will shape Franco-American relations for decades to come. This includes strengthening the flagship U.S.-French Fulbright Program, which will celebrate the 75th anniversary in 2023. They also intend to develop new ways for young French and Americans to learn about each other's culture and history, including through Villa Albertine's residency program for French and Francophone creators across the United States as well as for American creators across France. Likewise, they are creating the ""250 for 250"" program, which celebrates France's role in the founding of the United States, and the enduring friendship between their two nations, by sending 250 French students to study or intern in the United States and 250 American students to study or intern in France.

Joe Biden,"December 07, 2022",Joint Statement—United States-United Kingdom Energy Security and Affordability Partnership,"During this global energy crisis, brought on by Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine, it is more important than ever for allied countries to deepen their cooperation to ensure resilient international systems which reflect our shared values.
Working with our allies, the United States and United Kingdom commit to intensify our collaboration to support international energy security, affordability, and sustainability, as Europe reduces its dependence on Russian energy. Our immediate shared goal to stabilise energy markets, reduce demand, and ensure short-term security of supply is underpinned by the longer-term objective of supporting a stable energy transition to achieving net zero emissions by 2050, which in itself will strengthen our energy security.
To this end, we are establishing a Joint Action Group for Energy Security and Affordability to accelerate our immediate cooperation on short-term action to support energy security and affordability in the United Kingdom and across Europe.
The initiative will focus on the following priority areas:
1. Energy Efficiency and Innovative Energy Solutions 
Underscoring the importance of energy efficiency in bolstering energy security and affordability, partnering to explore market mechanisms, exchange best practices, and policy solutions to increase efficiency, contributing to a projected 8% reduction in end-user demand for gas in the UK this winter compared to the previous five years. We will explore targeted, data-driven measures that will save customers on their bills and increase efficiency without sacrificing comfort.
The UK will establish a new Energy Efficiency Taskforce to reduce the UK's energy consumption from buildings and industry by 15% by 2030 against 2021 levels. The £1.5 billion Help to Heat programme provides energy efficiency upgrades to low-income households, and the UK has committed an additional £6bn in energy efficiency schemes to 2028. Meanwhile, the U.S. is investing more than $30 billion in energy efficiency and renewable energy solutions for low-income communities.
Recognising the role of demand reduction technologies including, but not limited to: EVs, batteries, heat pumps, and home energy management systems, seeking to expedite deployment of these technologies to consumers.
Sharing lessons learned on creating competitive markets for these Energy Smart Appliances (ESAs) and best practice as these proposals develop, including assessing the potential for UK-led interoperability standards to be used in the U.S., and vice-versa.
2. Gas Supply 
Further enhancing U.S. LNG supply to the UK and wider European market by supporting the market conditions for security of supply, recognising the role of natural gas in ensuring near-term energy security, and in particular the significance of UK LNG import infrastructure and interconnection to wider European supply security.
Working with international partners and industry to strive to ensure LNG volumes of at least 9-10bcm over the next year via UK terminals from the U.S. To this end, we will look to identify opportunities to support commercial contracts that increase security of supply.
Committing to maintain an enabling regulatory environment to facilitate continued supplies, including domestic UK production, and to act on issues raised by stakeholders including in the private sector.
Prioritising low-carbon LNG infrastructure by promoting efforts to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity, incorporating Carbon Capture, Usage and Storage (CCUS) and renewables in production sites where possible, and collaborating to adopt regulatory frameworks to minimise leakage, venting, or flaring from new, modified, or existing infrastructure. Both sides take note of the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act's Methane Emissions Reduction Program, which will invest $1.55 billion to reduce methane emissions and implement a methane waste fee on major emitting facilities, as well as recent proposed standards from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to sharply reduce methane and other harmful air pollution, as well as to spur cutting-edge solutions to reduce leaks and wasted gas, from both new and existing sources in the oil and natural gas sectors.
3. Nuclear Cooperation 
Promoting civil nuclear as a safe and reliable part of the clean energy transition, and a secure source of energy, including through ensuring that global supply chains are less dependent on unreliable sources to pursue this objective.
Working together to deepen global collaboration between like-minded countries on Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) in a way that mutually benefits our respective industries and provides opportunities for UK and U.S. industry to support a resilient and diversified nuclear fuel supply chain.
4. International Collaboration on Clean Energy 
Working with G7 and G20 partners to drive forward a high ambition energy transition agenda, including in the run up to COP28, reducing the risk of future fossil fuel dependency in emerging markets and developing countries, avoiding any backtracking on previous commitments, enhancing and accelerating ambition toward the achievement of net-zero energy sectors, incorporating implementation of the Glasgow Climate Pact, and ensuring energy security in the current geopolitical context.
In support of these goals, advancing Just Energy Transition Partnerships (JETPs) with international partners, alongside advancing the G7 Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII).
Partnering on the development of, investment in and mass deployment of clean energy technologies, including through International Energy Agency (IEA) technology collaboration programs, International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), and Clean Energy Ministerial (CEM) and Mission Innovation initiatives.
In support of this, collaborating to establish global exports and imports of hydrogen and hydrogen technologies, including through: the development of appropriate and compatible certification schemes; the expedition of the development of the first wave of global clean hydrogen projects by exchanging information, experience and expertise; and the acceleration of the creation of hydrogen hubs in both the UK and US through industrial engagement in hard to abate sectors,
Continuing close collaboration on CCUS by sharing policies and lessons learned on the multilateral stage to advance global deployment.
The Joint Action Group will be convened by a representative from the offices of the President and the Prime Minister. It will particularly focus on intensifying further commercial and scientific ties between our two countries. It will complement the existing Strategic Energy Dialogue, which is the principal mechanism for collaboration on net zero technologies, financing of nuclear projects, and multilateral initiatives.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/joint-statement-united-states-united-kingdom-energy-security-and-affordability-partnership
Joe Biden,"December 12, 2022",Joint Statement—Group of Seven (G-7) Nations Leaders' Statement,"1. We, the Leaders of the Group of Seven (G7), met on 12 December, to reflect on progress of our cooperation under Germany's Presidency to jointly address global challenges at a time of severe geopolitical crisis and critical moment for the world economy. We were joined by Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. This year in the face of Russia's illegal, unjustifiable and unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine, we stood more united than ever, together with Ukraine and in unwavering commitment to our shared values, the rules-based multilateral order and international cooperation.
2. Today, we reaffirm our unwavering support for and solidarity with Ukraine in the face of ongoing Russian war of aggression for as long as it takes. We condemn Russia's continuous inhumane and brutal attacks targeting critical infrastructure, in particular energy and water facilities, and cities across Ukraine, and recall that indiscriminate attacks and attacks on the civilian population or civilian objects, constitute a war crime. We also condemn those who are facilitating Putin's illegal war. We are determined to help Ukraine repair, restore and defend its critical energy and water infrastructure. We will help Ukraine in meeting its winter preparedness needs, will continue to support Ukraine's civilian resilience, and will further enhance our efforts on this during the international conference to be held in Paris on 13 December. We are determined that Russia will ultimately need to pay for the restoration of critical infrastructure damaged or destroyed through its brutal war. There can be no impunity for war crimes and other atrocities. We will hold President Putin and those responsible to account in accordance with international law. We reiterate that Russia's irresponsible nuclear rhetoric is unacceptable and that any use of chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons would be met with severe consequences.
3. Building on our commitments so far, we will continue to galvanise international support to help address Ukraine's urgent short-term financing needs. We ask our Finance Ministers to convene shortly to discuss a joint approach for coordinated budget support in 2023. We affirm that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) should be central to this effort.
4. We firmly support efforts to secure Ukraine's immediate financial stability and its recovery and reconstruction towards a sustainable, prosperous and democratic future, in line with its European path. We will build on the outcomes of the International Expert Conference on the Recovery, Reconstruction and Modernisation of Ukraine held on 25 October in Berlin, as well as at the Ukraine Recovery Conference on 21-22 June 2023 in London. In particular, with a view to supporting Ukraine's repair, recovery and reconstruction, together with Ukraine and our international partners and in close coordination with relevant International Organisations and International Financial Institutions, we will establish a multi-agency Donor Coordination Platform. Through this platform, we will coordinate existing mechanisms to provide ongoing short- and long-term support—with particular responsibility of the Finance Track for short-term financial support—, coordinate further international funding and expertise, and encourage Ukraine's reform agenda as well as private sector led growth. We will also set up a Secretariat for the Platform. We will each designate a senior government representative to oversee the set-up of the platform and ongoing coordination efforts, and ask them to convene as soon as possible in January 2023.
5. With a view to a viable post-war peace settlement, we remain ready to reach arrangements together with Ukraine and interested countries and institutions on sustained security and other commitments to help Ukraine defend itself, secure its free and democratic future, and deter future Russian aggression in line with its rights enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations (UN Charter).
6. We will continue to coordinate efforts to meet Ukraine's urgent requirements for military and defense equipment with an immediate focus on providing Ukraine with air defense systems and capabilities.
7. We also reiterate our strong condemnation of Russia's continued seizure and militarisation of Ukraine's Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant, the abduction and reported abuse of Ukrainian personnel, and the willful destabilisation of its operations. We support the International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) efforts to establish a Safety and Security Zone.
8. Russia's war of aggression must end. To date, we have not seen evidence that Russia is committed to sustainable peace efforts. Russia can end this war immediately by ceasing its attacks against Ukraine and completely and unconditionally withdrawing its forces from the territory of Ukraine. We welcome and support President Zelenskyy's initiative for a just peace.
9. We remain committed to our unprecedented coordinated sanctions measures in response to Russia's war of aggression. We will maintain and intensify economic pressure on Russia and those who evade and undermine our restrictive measures. We will continue to shield vulnerable countries that are severely impacted by the repercussions of Russia's war of aggression and its weaponisation of energy and food.
10. We reaffirm our intention to phase out Russian-origin crude oil and petroleum products from our domestic markets. During the week of 5 December 2022, the price cap on seaborne Russian crude oil entered into force in our respective jurisdictions, delivering on our commitment to limit Russia from profiting from its war of aggression against Ukraine, to support stability in global energy markets and to minimise negative economic spillovers of Russia's war of aggression, especially on low- and middle-income countries. We encourage third countries that seek to import seaborne Russian-origin crude oil and petroleum products to leverage the price cap. We reiterate our decision that the price cap on Russian origin petroleum products will enter into force on 5 February 2023.
11. Russia's war in Ukraine is exacerbating existing fragilities in the global economy, with direct impacts on the cost of living of people in our own countries, and on the world's most vulnerable. We will continue to use all available policy tools to maintain global financial, macroeconomic and price stability and long-term fiscal sustainability, while providing targeted support to those most in need and working collaboratively to strengthen our collective economic security to external shocks and wider risks. We will make public investments and structural reforms to promote long term growth. We will further coordinate to respond to the urgent needs of most vulnerable countries and will encourage private investment in developing and emerging markets as a key enabler of sustainable economic pathways.
12. We will keep up our ambition to address global food insecurity, including through the Global Alliance for Food Security (GAFS). We will keep supporting the delivery of grain and fertilisers to vulnerable countries in need and welcome the recent operations led by the World Food Programme (WFP) on this front. We welcome the extension of the Black Sea Grain Initiative (BSGI) alongside further efforts to bring Ukrainian food to the world, namely the European Union's Solidarity Lanes and the Grain from Ukraine Initiative.
13. Reaffirming our steadfast commitment to implement the Paris Agreement and the outcomes of COP26 and COP27, we commit to urgent, ambitious, and inclusive climate action in this decade to limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. We reaffirm our commitment to reach net-zero emissions no later than 2050. To that end, and building on our statement adopted in June in Elmau, we endorse the Climate Club's terms of reference as established by the Climate Club Task Force and hereby establish an open and cooperative international Climate Club. Focusing in particular on the decarbonisation of industries, we will thereby contribute to unlocking green growth. We invite international partners to join the Climate Club and to participate in the further elaboration of its concept and structure. In doing so, we will continue working closely together with relevant International Organisations and stakeholders. We ask the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), in tandem with the International Energy Agency (IEA), to host an interim secretariat working together with other International Organisations.
14. Recalling our commitment to halt and reverse biodiversity loss by 2030, we will work intensively towards a successful outcome at Convention of Biological Diversity (CBD) COP15, in particular the adoption of an ambitious and effective global biodiversity framework, with clear and measurable targets and its prompt and swift implementation. In this regard we are committed to mobilising resources from all sources and to substantially increasing our national and international funding for nature by 2025 to support the implementation of an ambitious global framework. We encourage countries beyond the G7 to join us in this endeavor.
15. Accelerating our contributions to the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) to make our global partners a better offer on sustainable, inclusive, climate-resilient, and quality infrastructure investment, we welcome the progress on the Just Energy Transitions Partnerships (JETP) with South Africa and Indonesia as flagship projects for multilateral cooperation, just energy transition and sustainable investment and look forward to swiftly concluding negotiations on a JETP with Vietnam, as well as to making further progress with India and Senegal. We will intensify our cooperation within a PGII working group to deliver on our joint ambition to mobilise up to 600 billion dollars by 2027, and on JETPs, we will coordinate through the JETP working group.
16. Reaffirming our full commitment to realise gender equality and to consistently mainstream gender equality into all policy areas, we welcome the key recommendations by the Gender Equality Advisory Council (GEAC) and look forward to receiving the GEAC's full report by the end of the year. We thank this year's GEAC for its important work, reiterate our intention to convene the GEAC as a standing feature of all G7 Presidencies, and look forward to further strengthening it.
17. This year, we have achieved progress to improve the global health architecture with the World Health Organization (WHO) at its core, our capacity to prevent, prepare for and respond to future global health emergencies and to achieve universal health coverage, especially through the G7 Pact for Pandemic Readiness endorsed in Elmau. We welcome the successful Seventh Replenishment of the Global Fund for AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (Global Fund). We will step up our efforts on training and qualifying health workforce as well as strengthening surveillance capacities to detect outbreaks and variants as early as possible by integrating the One Health approach. We will continue to support science to develop safe and effective vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics.
18. Under the German Presidency, we, the G7, together with other international partners, have demonstrated our resolve to jointly addressing both major systemic challenges and immediate crises of our time. Our commitments and actions pave the way for progress towards an equitable world. As we look to the 2023 G7 Summit in Hiroshima under the Japanese Presidency, and in our support to the Indian G20 Presidency, we stand strong, united and absolutely committed to rebuilding a peaceful, prosperous and sustainable future for all.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/joint-statement-group-seven-g-7-nations-leaders-statement-0
Joe Biden,"December 15, 2022",Joint Statement by the African Union and the United States on Food Security,"The African Union and the United States reaffirm their shared commitment to realizing African food security by establishing a strategic partnership to guide and accelerate their work.
This strategic framework will reference and build on existing bilateral, regional, multilateral, non-governmental, and philanthropic efforts to advance food security and will leverage the public and private sectors to address immediate and acute food and fertilizer needs in the short-term—including by addressing food supplies that have been disrupted—and promote transformational investments in medium-to long-term sustainable and resilient food systems.
We seek to make concrete progress on the short-term goals and to develop a plan of action for the longer-term goals by the African Union's Summit in February 2023.
An Urgent Imperative 
The compounding impact of the global pandemic, the climate crisis, high energy and fertilizer prices, as well as protracted conflicts, including Russia's war in Ukraine, have spurred U.S. and African leaders to refocus and scale public and private sector investments to help solve the root causes of the food crisis that has had a disproportionate impact on African nations.
We recognize the critical importance of strengthening, protecting, and accelerating progress towards achieving African food security to enable African countries to trade more and enhance connectivity to critical agricultural markets. We also acknowledge the critical importance of agriculture as a source of millions of jobs and livelihoods across the continent, including among youth and women. We further note the enormous untapped potential the continent represents, home to more than 60 percent of the world's unused arable farmland, and the opportunity that represents in terms of Africa's role in addressing global food insecurity. Through this strategic partnership, we intend to utilize all diplomatic, multilateral, technical, and financial tools to build stronger and diversified food systems and supply chains, to scale Africa's agricultural production capacity and to invest in more resilient agricultural sectors.
We reaffirm the commitments of the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program (CAADP), the Malabo Declaration and its Call to Action, and the Global Food Security Summit held on the margins of the United Nations General Assembly, for emergency assistance as well as medium- to long-term investments for resilient food systems to address chronic food insecurity as well as the priority actions outlined in the International Financial Institutions (IFI) Action Plan to Address Food Insecurity and the African Development Bank's African Emergency Food Production Plan. We also note the Dakar International Conference on Agriculture to be co-hosted by the Government of Senegal and AfDB on January 25-27, 2023.
We also recognize the importance of intensifying efforts related to climate adaptation, soil health and fertility, and the widespread use of improved agricultural inputs.
U.S. -Africa Food Security Framework 
To meet these goals, this U.S.-Africa strategic partnership will address both short-term and longer-term priorities. The United States is committed to leveraging its unique convening power to bring together the private sector and international financial institutions to address underinvestment and to identify and remove obstacles that impede Africa's full participation in global food and fertilizer supply chains and markets. In turn, the African Union will politically commit that participating AU members will address and remove obstacles that impede agriculture-centered investments.
In the short-term:
Identify means for Africa to secure more diverse and resilient sources of grain and fertilizer supply—in the very near term and on a commercial basis—to meet its immediate needs.
Where there is an acute need for humanitarian assistance, we will work together to provide immediate life-saving assistance, including cash, food and nutrition supplies—including where possible, by sourcing from the continent—to prevent famine or malnutrition, while helping to prepare for future shocks and pilot resilient investments.
In the medium- and long-term, the United States and Africa will exert leadership to address chronic underinvestment and policy shortcomings with respect to agriculture and food systems, in concert with other willing partners to:
Explore ways to improve Africa's access to global markets for agricultural commodities.
Highlight the importance of African governments carrying out the policy reforms needed to achieve food security, notably by improving land access, enhancing the business environment, promoting open trade, and strengthening good governance.
Identify and promote opportunities for transformative medium- to long-term investments from governments, the private sector—including the U.S. private sector, and multilateral development banks to strengthen the climate-resilience of agriculture and food systems, improve productivity, and increase sustainability.
Increase the reliable and sustainable access to fertilizers and their inputs, with a focus on climate-smart alternatives, soil management and fertilizer efficiency techniques, to prevent shortages, reduce dependency on single-source fertilizer producers, help increase competition among fertilizer producers, and help increase crop yields in vulnerable African food markets.
Focus on diversifying the production of agricultural commodities, including core commodities and traditional crops. This includes strengthening the physical and digital infrastructure and logistical supply chains to produce fertilizers and grow food and to cultivate, store and transport food efficiently. In addition, this effort will seek to improve transportation of food within regional food markets to bolster inter-regional trade and reduce single supplier dependency of African food systems.
Promote effective agricultural production practices, approaches, and research and development across the full agricultural ecosystem, including greater access to innovative financial tools.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/joint-statement-the-african-union-and-the-united-states-food-security
Joe Biden,"December 15, 2022",Joint Statement—Vision Statement for the United States-Africa Partnership,"On the occasion of the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit in Washington, D.C., the United States and the African Union, under the leadership of President Joseph R. Biden, Jr., President of Senegal and Chair of the African Union Macky Sall, and African Union Commission Chair Moussa Faki Mahamat, affirm our commitment to reinforce longstanding areas of cooperation and expand our partnership to better meet the shared challenges—and opportunities—of our dynamic era. The United States and African nations recognize that our world is quickly changing, and this Summit reflected how our relationship is evolving with it. We will deepen our collaboration to solve global problems and shape the rules of the road for technology, space, cybersecurity, trade, environmental protection, and economics.
Our partnership is based on a conviction that Africa's governments and peoples will help define the future of the international order to address our world's most pressing challenges. The United States, for its part, will support and work to realize greater—and long overdue—African representation in international institutions, including those that shape global governance. The United States has announced a plan to reform the United Nations Security Council, including support for permanent seats for countries in Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean, and voiced support for the African Union to join the G20 as a permanent member. We will continue to lead with our shared values, including a commitment to the United Nations Charter and to defending the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all states.
At the Summit, we announced new investments and initiatives that will equip American and African institutions and citizens to respond to emerging opportunities and challenges in an increasingly urban and connected world. Our renewed and expanded partnership is critical to tackling the food security and climate crises, strengthening health systems and preparing for the next pandemic, building a strong and inclusive global economy, supporting good governance and respect for human rights, and advancing peace and security.
We are dedicated to responding to the current food security crisis and bolstering resilient and sustainable food systems. Recognizing today's acute food security needs, which have been heightened by the war in Ukraine, we plan to continue to partner to supply humanitarian assistance to vulnerable communities. But responding to emergencies is not enough; we announced a new strategic partnership that seeks to deepen our collaboration to increase food production capacity and diversify and strengthen the resilience of food supply chains.
We recognize that many of the world's countries that are most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change are in Africa. Building on the progress made at COP27, we jointly stress the urgency and importance of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and pursuing a just energy transition, while partnering to build resilience to climate hazards. We are committed to supporting climate adaptation and resilience efforts and will work to facilitate enhanced collaboration among our respective governments, other international partners, education and research institutions, and private sectors to do so.
We reaffirm our shared commitment to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats. As part of this effort, we will expand our support to strengthen the region's health workforce, regional manufacturing capacity, and health infrastructure. We have deepened the partnership between the United States and Africa CDC to achieve our shared global health goals.
We are resolved to enhance our collaboration to promote inclusive growth and sustainable development. We will bring together business and government leaders to advance two-way trade and accelerate investment in quality infrastructure. We will leverage our institutions and programs, in addition to strengthening enabling environments, to realize this shared aspiration. This will include expanded engagement and cooperation between the United States and African countries to support the aims of the Agreement Establishing the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA).
We are increasing our cooperation to tackle insecurity, criminality, and terrorism. We affirm that locally led approaches are essential to advancing our mutual interest in a peaceful and secure Africa. We understand that economic inequality, political marginalization, and abuse of power are drivers of conflict. We will adopt a more holistic approach to address insecurity, and promote transparency, accountability, and respect for human rights.
We will reinforce our commitment to democracy, the rule of law, and human rights. Importantly, we will focus on restoring civilian rule in countries currently in transition and demonstrate that democracy delivers across the region.
Like all partners, we will sometimes disagree. Rather than allow these differences to divide or define the partnership, we will include areas of divergence on the agenda and welcome respectful debate as a sign of the strength and maturity of our relationships.
Through our partnership, we will harness the dynamism of the African and American peoples to enhance prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic. Our vibrant business, civil society, and people-to-people ties are sources of strength that we will leverage with greater purpose than before. We will prioritize engagement with members of the African Diaspora, whose voices are critical in the United States and around the world.
More work remains to realize our shared aspirations. Recognizing the importance of implementing the commitments discussed at the Summit, we intend to accelerate high-level exchanges and dedicate senior diplomats to carry out our joint vision for a 21st century partnership. The future of Africa and the United States depends on what we can achieve together. We will redouble our efforts to ensure our partnership delivers results for our peoples and the world.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/joint-statement-vision-statement-for-the-united-states-africa-partnership
Joe Biden,"December 23, 2022","Statement on Congressional Passage of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023","The bipartisan funding bill advances key priorities for our country and caps off a year of historic bipartisan progress for the American people.
This bill is good for our economy, our competitiveness, and our communities, and I will sign it into law as soon as it reaches my desk. This bill will advance cutting-edge research on cancer and other diseases through my ARPA-H initiative. It will put more cops on the beat, invest in community policing, and provide the highest funding level for the Violence Against Women Act in history. It will help us meet our sacred obligation to America's veterans and deliver on the promise of the PACT Act, my bipartisan legislation to expand health care benefits to veterans. It will provide additional assistance to Ukraine, another demonstration of our bipartisan support for Ukraine after President Zelenskyy's visit. It will help communities recovering from devastating natural disasters get back on their feet. And it'll strengthen worker protections for pregnant women.
I want to thank Senator Leahy, Senator Shelby, and Chairwoman DeLauro for their tireless work to get this done. Neither side got everything it wanted in this agreement. That's what happens in a negotiation.
And bipartisan Members of Congress passed the Electoral Count Act and took long overdue steps to protect the integrity of our elections. This is critical bipartisan action that will help ensure that the will of the people is preserved. I want to thank Senators Collins and Manchin, as well as Senators Klobuchar and Blunt, for finding compromise to strengthen our democracy in the face of election denialism and assaults on our bedrock constitutional values.
This bill is further proof that Republicans and Democrats can come together to deliver for the American people, and I'm looking forward to continued bipartisan progress in the year ahead.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-congressional-passage-the-consolidated-appropriations-act-2023
Joe Biden,"January 13, 2023",Joint Statement by President Biden and Prime Minister Fumio Kishida of Japan,"President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. of the United States and Prime Minister Kishida Fumio of Japan meet at a historic moment for our Alliance, the Indo-Pacific, and the world. Our cooperation today is unprecedented, rooted in our shared vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific and a peaceful and prosperous world, guided by our shared values including the rule of law. At the same time, the Indo-Pacific faces growing challenges, from actions inconsistent with the rules-based international order by China to provocations by North Korea. In Europe, meanwhile, Russia continues to wage its unjust and brutal war of aggression against Ukraine. We strongly oppose any unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force or coercion, anywhere in the world. Taken together, this landscape demands that the United States and Japan continue to strengthen our individual and collective capacity. To that end, President Biden commended Japan's bold leadership in fundamentally reinforcing its defense capabilities and strengthening diplomatic efforts, as illustrated in the new National Security Strategy, National Defense Strategy and Defense Buildup Program. This investment will bolster security across the Indo-Pacific and beyond and modernize the U.S.-Japan relationship for the 21st century.
Our security Alliance has never been stronger. The two leaders reaffirmed that the Alliance remains the cornerstone of peace, security, and prosperity of the Indo-Pacific. President Biden reiterated the unwavering commitment of the United States to the defense of Japan under Article V of the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security, using its full range of capabilities, including nuclear. He also reaffirmed that Article V applies to the Senkaku Islands. In their Security Consultative Committee (""2+2""), our foreign and defense ministers highlighted the exceptional progress we have made toward modernizing our Alliance. Together, we have aligned our collective force posture and deterrence capabilities to meet new and emerging threats, including in the cyber and space domains. The leaders also instructed their ministers to reinforce cooperation on the development and effective employment of Japan's counterstrike and other capabilities. We have deepened cooperation on critical and emerging technologies that are crucial for national security. We reaffirm our commitment to the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula in accordance with United Nations Security Council resolutions. President Biden reaffirms U.S. commitment to the immediate resolution of the abductions issue. We emphasize that our basic positions on Taiwan remain unchanged, and reiterate the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait as an indispensable element of security and prosperity in the international community. We encourage the peaceful resolution of cross-Strait issues. We also recognize that the challenges we face transcend geography. United across the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, we have stood together in firm opposition to Russia's unjust and brutal war of aggression against Ukraine, and we will continue to impose sanctions on Russia, and provide unwavering support for Ukraine. We state unequivocally that any use of a nuclear weapon by Russia in Ukraine would be an act of hostility against humanity and unjustifiable in any way. And we will continue to support Ukraine in the face of Russia's abhorrent attacks on critical infrastructure.
The United States and Japan also reaffirm our economic leadership. As the two largest democratic economies in the world, we look forward to advancing domestic and global prosperity and upholding a free, fair and rules-based economic order through Japan's Presidency of the G7 and the United States' hosting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC). The two leaders discussed priorities for the G7 Hiroshima Summit and will continue to work closely toward a successful summit so as to demonstrate the G7's commitment to upholding the international order based on the rule of law. Building on our efforts in the U.S.-Japan Competitiveness and Resilience (CoRe) Partnership, including through the Economic Policy Consultative Committee, we will sharpen our shared edge on economic security, including protection and promotion of critical and emerging technologies, including semiconductors; space, including through our new bilateral Space Framework Agreement; and clean energy and energy security, where we have deepened our cooperation on nuclear energy while upholding the highest nonproliferation standards. We will build resilience in our societies and supply chains among like-minded partners against threats such as economic coercion, non-market policies and practices and natural disasters, accelerate global efforts to tackle the climate crisis, and advance data free flow with trust. The Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) is at the center of achieving these goals. As inclusive democracies, we will ensure economic prosperity is broadly shared across our societies and recommit to achieving gender equity and equality as well as women's empowerment. Globally, we will work together to drive sustainable progress to net zero, evolve the multilateral development banks to better address global challenges, and improve creditor coordination to provide debt relief. We will condemn all who use their economic power to take advantage of others, including Russia's undermining of energy and food security around the world. We also call on China to report adequate transparent epidemiological and viral genomic sequence data regarding the spread of COVID-19, to enable public health officials around the world be prepared to reduce the spread and identify any potential new variants.
With an unbreakable bilateral relationship as our foundation, we will also collaborate with others, in the region and beyond, for the benefit of the Indo-Pacific and the world. Together with Australia and India, we will ensure the Quad continues to be a force for good, committed to bringing tangible benefits to the region, including by delivering results on global health, cybersecurity, climate, critical and emerging technologies, and maritime domain awareness. We will continue supporting ASEAN centrality and unity as well as the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific. We commit to strengthening vital trilateral cooperation among Japan, the Republic of Korea, and the United States, in security and other domains. And we will bolster our growing collaboration in the Pacific Islands, including through the Partners in the Blue Pacific. President Biden congratulated Japan on the start of its two-year term on the UN Security Council and on its presidency for the month of January. We begin 2023 together as the closest of allies and friends, newly committed to achieving peace and prosperity, not only through our words but through our actions. The times demand no less.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/joint-statement-president-biden-and-prime-minister-fumio-kishida-japan

Joe Biden,"February 08, 2023","Interview with Judy Woodruff of CBS News in Madison, Wisconsin","Bennett:
Fresh off his State of the Union address, President Biden left Washington for Wisconsin today.
Nawaz:
It's part of a new White House push to get out of D.C. to highlight the economy and investments in infrastructure and blue-collar jobs.
Our own Judy Woodruff was on the ground with him in Madison — Judy.
Woodruff:
Hi, Amna and Geoff.
So, early this afternoon, the president toured a union job training site here in DeForest, Wisconsin, just north of Madison, where he underlined his support for trade workers and for training programs. This is all part of the White House push, his push to grow the middle class by creating jobs for people that don't require a four-year college degree.
Shortly after that, I sat down with him right here for a long-delayed and wide-ranging conversation. We touched on the state of the economy. We talked about my new project, the country's deep divisions. We're calling it America at a Crossroads. And we also talked about the coming political season.
Mr. President, thank you very much for talking with us.
THE PRESIDENT:
Happy to be here.
Woodruff:
We are in Wisconsin. But let me ask you first about last night, the State of the Union. You are getting a lot of attaboys today from your fellow Democrats who are saying you showed energy, optimism. You stood up to the Republicans. They were yelling at you. Some of them were calling you a liar. Did you expect that kind of reaction?
THE PRESIDENT:
From the folks who did it, I was. The vast majority of Republicans weren't that way. But, you know, there's still a significant element of what I call the MAGA Republicans, you know, the 'Make America Great Again' Republicans. And it's you know, I didn't. I kind of anticipated but there are an awful lot of — The speaker was gracious and so was you know, there were a lot of members.
Judy Woodruff:
You almost seemed to be enjoying the back and forth. Were you enjoying it?
THE PRESIDENT:
Well, you know, as you know, Judy, I spent most of my career with the Congress and members of the Congress. I know, I know the place well. I know the system well. And I always feel comfortable when I'm up on the Hill, for real. Did most of my life. Wasn't too bad at it either.
Judy Woodruff:
Here we are. As we said in Wisconsin, you've just given a talk to a group of union members. This place where we're sitting is all about training folks in construction work, union work. When you think about that, what is it, $1,000,000,000,000 worth of money that's going to come from the Inflation Reduction Act, the infrastructure legislation, the CHIPS manufacturing bill, $1,000,000,000,000. How do you see that making a difference?
THE PRESIDENT:
There's a lot more than that. It's going to make a gigantic difference. Look, we've already created 800,000 manufacturing jobs. Just in two years. That's more jobs than anyone's created anyway. And and we paid for it all. We actually reduce the debt, the deficit, by $1.7 trillion over two years. And what it's about is about giving working folks a chance. And I don't mean just labor. I mean, look, you've probably heard me say before, I've never been a big fan of trickle down economics. Family I was raised in, a lot didn't trickle down to our table. But, you know, the middle class, when it does well, everybody does well. So my goal was when I got elected was to campaign on this bill from the bottom up in the middle out. When that happens, the poor have a chance up and the middle class does well and the wealthy always do well. So.
Judy Woodruff:
And these jobs, these kinds of jobs, what effect do you think this will have on on working class Americans who frankly, more and more of them are voting Republican.
THE PRESIDENT:
Well it will have a profound effect. I mean, look, all just as I was told we were going to lose big the last election, the off-year election, I said we weren't. Just as we were told I wasn't going to be able to pass Inflation Reduction Act or the CHIP. We passed them all. And and what's happening now is people don't understandably, don't realize all of our past back in June, July, August to September, and is only coming to fruition now. For example, Judy, we pay the highest drug prices of any nation in the world, yet people didn't know until January, even though we talked about it since last summer, that prescription drugs costs were going to go down and, for example, insulin. Insulin for seniors instead of being four or five hundred bucks a month is now $35 a month. And people are going, 'whoa'. And there's so much more to come. And look, I think we start off with the proposition — I do anyway — that the vast majority of Americans don't think the tax system is fair. I mean, the vast majority, including, you know, wealthy, well-off suburbanites. And the idea you got a thousand trillionaires and they pay less for the percentage of their income than a schoolteacher does. I mean, so there's a lot going on. We got a lot passed and its now just they're going to start to roll out.
Judy Woodruff:
And I want to ask you about that because the picture you painted last night: unemployment, record low — the growth, the economy, what is it? Inflation is coming down, incomes are rising. And yet when you when you mention the polls, when you look at the polls, CBS poll, 64% of Americans think the economy is in bad shape. There's an NBC poll, 71% think the country's on the wrong track. Why the disconnect?
THE PRESIDENT:
Because the polls don't matter anymore. You got to make, what, 40, 50 calls and on a cell phone to get someone to answer a poll? Even the pollsters, you talk to them. Ask them what they think about this. Look.
Judy Woodruff:
So you don't think it's your policy?
THE PRESIDENT:
Oh, I know the policy. By the way, if you ask the same things. Do they support the rebuilding infrastructure America? Overwhelmingly support. Ask anybody. Do they support the CHIPS and Science Act where we've attracted $300 billion in investments? We invented these chips. They're coming back to America. We're going to be the leaders again. When you ask them about whether or not they think they're paying too much, too much for drug prices. Overwhelmingly, yes. So it's all just like, look, people went through hell the last several years, the last five years in the pandemic. We lost a million people, dead. And so every time you turn on the news, are you reporting any positive news, I'm not I'm not meaning you personally, editorially. So you turn on the television and everything's down. And so people understandably are down.
Judy Woodruff:
So when people at the Gallup Poll saying most Americans think next year the economy is going to be bad, do you think there's going to be a recession?
THE PRESIDENT:
No.
Judy Woodruff:
This year?
THE PRESIDENT:
No. Or next year. From the moment I got elected, how many of the experts are saying within the next six months is going to be recession?
Judy Woodruff:
So I'm launching a reporting project for the NewsHour looking at why the country is so divided politically, culturally. What do you think? Why do you think it is?
THE PRESIDENT:
Well, I think it's a number of reasons. Number one, I think that we. There was a deliberate effort by the last guy to play on people's fears and to appeal to base instincts. I mean, and it's just it's not who we are, but people are — you know, I also noticed a fair amount of Republicans standing up last night and clapping. You know, for example, when I pointed out that some Republicans are talking about eliminating Medicare. They said, 'no, no, no.' I said oh, okay. That means all of you are for supporting Medicare? Everybody raise your hand. They all raised their hand. So guess what? We accomplished something. Unless they break their word. There are going to be no cuts in Medicare, Social Security. My point is, I think it's the way we talk to each other. And I think, you know, look, I think what happened was that the party started to take for granted ordinary blue collar workers. And they really got hurt. They got hurt the previous four or five years and everything went wrong in their lives. Look at all the factories that have closed and left you know, the United States. Look at all the things that have happened. But they're coming back now. And I've just gotta to make sure everybody knows what we've done. Watch how it unfolds and see what happens.
Judy Woodruff:
You came to Washington, to the Senate, 50 years ago. This was just before Watergate where there had been assassinations, Vietnam War, civil rights struggles. Do you think now is worse than then? How do you compare?
THE PRESIDENT:
I don't think it was better or worse. I think what happened was then we had a different set of problems, but we didn't have many people playing on the fears of the American people. There was just genuine debate about and discord about the war in Vietnam. The civil rights movement, which got me involved in politics in the first place, was just reaching a culmination point where we really began to pass the Civil Rights Act and a number of things. So I think it's a process. And I think that most Americans are of the view that we've got this. It's gotten too mean. It's gotten too, too personal and too divisive. And I think one of the things — the message they sent this last election was 'come on, work together, get something done for us.'
Judy Woodruff:
And speaking of that, this last session of Congress, as you said last night, a lot was accomplished, including bipartisan, in a bipartisan way. This session coming up right now is different. You got a Republican majority in the House, a number of supporters of former
President Trump. Realistically, Mr. President, what do you think you can get done? I mean, assuming the the debt limit issue gets resolved.
THE PRESIDENT:
I think.
Judy Woodruff:
What do you think you can get done?
THE PRESIDENT:
I think the American public, I think when we vote on whether or not to extend the Medicare benefit, I mean, health care benefits to ordinary Americans, not just on Medicare and Medicaid. I think we will see that. We say that insulin should be available for 35 bucks for every American out there. I think you're going to see a lot of things done because people are becoming aware of what we can do, and we're starting to see those things happening. And one of the reasons I'm here at this facility, you know, the laborers now, most people think that, you know, we're going to be a laborer. Well, you just sign up, you show up. They have four years apprenticeships to become a laborer. It's like going to college again, not again. So going to college. We're the best trained workers in the world. And for example, when I asked the.
Judy Woodruff:
But, you think you can get those things through, that you just
THE PRESIDENT:
I know I can.
Judy Woodruff:
With with Republicans .
THE PRESIDENT:
Yeah. By the way, we got them through the things I'm talking about. We've already gotten through. And I think it's a matter of just demonstrating what we've done.
Judy Woodruff:
One of the things Republicans say is a priority for them is investigating your family, your son, Hunter, your brother Jim. They talk about access that they say others have gotten because of you, because of your political success. How do you plan to deal with that?
THE PRESIDENT:
Public's not going to pay attention that. They want these guys to do something. If the only thing they can do is make up things about my family. It's not going to go very far.
Judy Woodruff:
I want to ask you about foreign policy, and a few things to ask you about this.
THE PRESIDENT:
Sure.
Judy Woodruff:
A Chinese surveillance balloon that went across the country. You ordered the military, the fighter jets to shoot it down off the coast of South Carolina. But Republicans are saying you look weak. Mike Gallagher, the congressman, said.
THE PRESIDENT:
He's an impressive guy, isn't he?
Judy Woodruff:
'Inexplicable' that you didn't shoot it down earlier. Marco Rubio said it was 'dereliction of duty' not to immediately tell the public about this.
THE PRESIDENT:
Look. I told, it's now public. I told the military I wanted to shoot it down when it was safe to do it. They said it was unsafe to do it over land. They said they can learn a lot in the meantime by watching it go across the country. As soon as they had a chance to shoot it down over water, they did and they recovered major pieces of it to determine if we can learn anything from what they garnered and what kind of equipment they had. You know, there were several of these balloons that during the last administration they didn't even know they were there. They didn't even do anything about them. So, look, I just think that the idea that it was a dereliction of duty, I think, is a bizarre notion. China knows exactly that, what the deal is with us.
Judy Woodruff:
So China today is saying they feel smeared, that you smeared them and their leader in your remarks last night. Have relations now between the U.S. and China taken a big hit lately?
THE PRESIDENT:
No.
Judy Woodruff:
How do you know?
THE PRESIDENT:
I know. I talked to him.
Judy Woodruff:
You've talked to.
THE PRESIDENT:
Xi JinPing before. I in our team talks to their people.
Judy Woodruff:
During this?
THE PRESIDENT:
After, I haven't talked to him during this. But, look, I mean, the idea of shooting down a balloon that's gathering information over America and, that makes relations worse? Look, I made it real clear to Xi Jinping that we're going to compete fully with China, but we're not looking for conflict. And and that's been the case so far. China wants very, has… Let me put it another way as I said, you can think of any other, and you're very informed in foreign policy, can you think of any other world leader who would trade places with Xi Jinping? Not a joke. You think of any who would? I can't think of one. This man has enormous problems. Enormous. He has also great potential. But so far, he has an economy that's not functioning very well. He's in a situation where he is — for example, you know, everybody assumed that China would be all in with Russia and Ukraine. But they're not all in it. As a matter of fact I called him this summer to say this is not a threat, just an observation: look what's happened to Russia. 600 American corporations have pulled out of Russia. From McDonald's to Exxon. And I said, You've told me all along that the reason why you need a relationship with the United States in Europe is so they invest in China. So who's going to invest in China if you engage in the same kind of deal? You notice there's not been much going on there.
Judy Woodruff:
Ukraine, you mentioned that you, we heard what you said last night, but we now also hear from Jim Jordan, who is a Republican congressman, that maybe some of the money being spent in Ukraine should go for American citizens. We heard Kevin McCarthy say, begin to raise questions about it. It's now been $100 billion, somewhere in that area the U.S. has spent on Ukraine. You said to the ambassador last night we were with you until, you said, 'as long as it takes.' Does that mean this is an open ended commitment?
THE PRESIDENT:
It's a firm commitment. Look, when is the last… If these guys, Jordan or whoever you mentioned. The idea that the Russian military, with over a hundred thousand forces would invade and try to maraud Ukraine, and us stand by and do nothing. Come on? And what I've done, and I think I'm very proud of it, I've been able to unite NATO completely. He was convinced NATO would collapse. NATO would not be engaged. I've been able to get our our Asian allies to join with the Europeans in terms of taking on Russia, whether or not. So I mean, we are, we have a better relationship and tighter control over our destiny now than we've ever had. And, you know, we have Germany increasing our budget by over 2%. You have Japan doing the same thing. I mean, I just don't — I mean, if these guys don't want to help Ukraine, I get it. They don't want to do that. But what are they going to do when Ukraine rolls, when Russia rolls across Ukraine or into Belarus or anywhere else?
Judy Woodruff:
So is it open ended for now?
THE PRESIDENT:
Yeah, it is. Look, there's no way that Putin is going to be able to cope. He's already lost Ukraine. The idea that he's ever going to be able — Well, here's what he thought. He thought that if he invaded Ukraine, first of all, he'd get a welcome by every Russian speaker, they'd say, 'come on in.' And secondly, he thought what would happen is that NATO would collapse. NATO would not do anything. They'd be afraid to act. Then he thought anyway, go down the line. None of that's happening.
Judy Woodruff:
Two other quick questions, Mr. President. Classified documents. It's clear there's a difference between the way you've handled this and former President Trump. You've cooperated with the archives, with the FBI. But I want to ask you about quickly about what you said last September. You said just possessing classified documents is you said 'totally irresponsible.' So what was totally irresponsible about the fact that you had some.
THE PRESIDENT:
What they've informed me not to speak to this issue to anyway, try to prejudice the investigation that's going on. But what I was talking about was what was laid out. All these documents were a top secret, code word and all the rest. And I'm not at liberty and I'm not even sure, I made voluntarily — no one's had to threaten to do anything — voluntarily opened every single aperture I have in the house, offices, everything. For them to come and look and spend hours searching my home. Invited them. Nobody. And so, in the best of my knowledge, the kinds of things they picked up were things that from 1974 and stray papers. There may be something else, I don't know. But one of the things that happened is that what was not done well is as they packed up my offices to move them, they didn't do the kind of job that should have been done to go thoroughly through every single piece of literature that's there. But, I'll just let the investigation, you know, decide what's going on and we'll see what happens.
Judy Woodruff:
Last question, Mr. President. Every indication you're running for reelection. You haven't announced yet. Democrats, though, as you, I'm sure you know, are saying we wonder about his age. You'd be 82 to date of the next election, 86 if you're successful and elected and finish that term. Does it give you any concern?
THE PRESIDENT:
Watch me. It's all I can say. I mean, you know, it goes from one extreme to the other. Last night I was — I heard that people are saying, Well, just watch Biden, my God, age is not an issue anymore. Look, I'm a great respector of fate. I would be completely, thoroughly honest with the American people if I thought there was any health problem, anything that would keep me from being able to do the job. And and, so we'll see. But, you know, I just — I think people have to just watch me.
Judy Woodruff:
It sounds like you're running.
THE PRESIDENT:
I haven't made that decision. That's my intention, I think. But I haven't made that decision firmly yet.
Judy Woodruff:
Mr. President, thank you very much.
THE PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Judy. Thank you.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-judy-woodruff-cbs-news-madison-wisconsin
Joe Biden,"February 10, 2023",Joint Statement by President Biden and President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of Brazil,"Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. of the United States and President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of the Federative Republic of Brazil met in Washington, D.C. During the meeting, the two leaders reaffirmed the vital and enduring nature of the U.S.-Brazil relationship and underscored that strengthening democracy, promoting respect for human rights, and addressing the climate crisis remain at the center of their common agenda.
As leaders of the two largest democracies in the Americas, President Biden and President Lula pledged to work together to strengthen democratic institutions and welcomed the second Summit for Democracy to be held in March 2023. Both leaders noted they continue to reject extremism and violence in politics, condemned hate speech, and reaffirmed their intention to build societal resilience to disinformation, and agreed to work together on these issues. They discussed common objectives of advancing the human rights agenda through cooperation and coordination on such issues as social inclusion and labor rights, gender equality, racial equity and justice, and the protection of the rights of LGBTQI+ persons. They also committed to reinvigorating the U.S.-Brazil Joint Action Plan to Eliminate Racial and Ethnic Discrimination and Promote Equality to mutually benefit marginalized racial, ethnic, and Indigenous communities, including people of African descent, in both countries.
Both leaders are determined to place urgent priority on climate change, sustainable development, and the energy transition. They recognize the leading role Brazil and the United States can play cooperating both bilaterally and multilaterally, including under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Paris Agreement. Presidents Biden and Lula recalled the Joint Initiative on Climate Change established in 2015, which created the high level United States-Brazil Climate Change Working Group (CCWG). They decided to instruct the CCWG to reconvene as early as possible to discuss areas of cooperation, such as fighting deforestation and degradation, enhancing the bioeconomy, bolstering clean energy deployment, strengthening adaptation actions and promoting low carbon agriculture practices. As part of these efforts, the United States announced its intent to work with Congress to provide funds for programs to protect and conserve the Brazilian Amazon, including initial support for the Amazon Fund, and to leverage investments in this critical region. The leaders also expressed their determination to fight hunger and poverty, enhance global food security, foster trade and remove barriers, promote economic cooperation, and strengthen international peace and security.
They also discussed their interest in intensifying bilateral cooperation in areas such as trade and investment, energy, health, science, technology and innovation, defense, education and culture, and consular affairs, through a results-oriented approach that benefits both societies. Recognizing the importance of supply chain resilience, especially at the present global juncture, they committed to continue cooperation in this field with focused public-private dialogues.
The two leaders also discussed a wide range of global and regional issues of mutual concern. They deplored the violation of the territorial integrity of Ukraine by Russia and the annexation of parts of its territory as flagrant violations of international law and called for a just and durable peace. They expressed concern about the global effects of the conflict on food and energy security, especially on the poorest regions of the planet and voiced support for the full functioning of the Black Sea Grain Initiative. President Biden and President Lula affirmed their intention to strengthen cooperation in multilateral institutions, particularly in the context of the upcoming Brazilian presidency of the G20. The two leaders expressed their intent to work together toward meaningful United Nations Security Council reform, such as expansion of the body to include permanent seats for countries in Africa and in Latin America and the Caribbean in order to be more representative of the broader UN membership and enhance its ability to more effectively address the most pressing matters of global peace and security.
President Lula invited President Biden to visit Brazil, and President Biden accepted the invitation. The two leaders committed to broaden their dialogue and to pursue deeper cooperation in the lead-up to the celebration of the bicentennial of U.S.-Brazil diplomatic relations in 2024.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/joint-statement-president-biden-and-president-luiz-inacio-lula-da-silva-brazil-0
Joe Biden,"February 20, 2023","Statement on the President's Travel to Kyiv, Ukraine","As the world prepares to mark the 1-year anniversary of Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine, I am in Kyiv today to meet with President Zelenskyy and reaffirm our unwavering and unflagging commitment to Ukraine's democracy, sovereignty, and territorial integrity.
When Putin launched his invasion nearly 1 year ago, he thought Ukraine was weak and the West was divided. He thought he could outlast us. But he was dead wrong.
Today, in Kyiv, I am meeting with President Zelenskyy and his team for an extended discussion on our support for Ukraine. I will announce another delivery of critical equipment, including artillery ammunition, antiarmor systems, and air surveillance radars to help protect the Ukrainian people from aerial bombardments. And I will share that later this week, we will announce additional sanctions against elites and companies that are trying to evade or backfill Russia's war machine. Over the last year, the United States has built a coalition of nations from the Atlantic to the Pacific to help defend Ukraine with unprecedented military, economic, and humanitarian support, and that support will endure.
I also look forward to traveling on to Poland to meet President Duda and the leaders of our eastern flank allies, as well as deliver remarks on how the United States will continue to rally the world to support the people of Ukraine and the core values of human rights and dignity in the U.N. Charter that unite us worldwide.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-the-presidents-travel-kyiv-ukraine
Joe Biden,"February 24, 2023",Joint Statement—Group of Seven (G-7) Nations Leaders' Statement on the Situation in Ukraine,"1. At the one-year mark of Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine, we, the Leaders of the Group of Seven (G7), met with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to reaffirm our unwavering support for Ukraine for as long as it takes. Russia's heinous attacks over the last 365 days have laid bare the cruelty of the ongoing aggression. We condemn Russia's illegal, unjustifiable, and unprovoked war, disregard for the Charter of the United Nations (UN) and indifference to the impacts that its war is having on people worldwide. We salute the heroism of the Ukrainian people in their brave resistance. We commit to intensifying our diplomatic, financial and military support for Ukraine, to increasing the costs to Russia and those supporting its war effort, and to continuing to counter the negative impacts of the war on the rest of the world, particularly on the most vulnerable people.
2. Russia started this war and Russia can end this war. We call on Russia to stop its ongoing aggression and to immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw its troops from the entire internationally recognized territory of Ukraine. In the past year Russian forces have killed thousands of Ukrainians, caused millions to flee, and forcibly deported many thousands of Ukrainians, including children, to Russia. Russia has destroyed hospitals, schools, and energy and critical infrastructure, and left historic cities in ruins. In areas liberated from Russian forces, there is evidence of mass graves, sexual violence, torture and other atrocities. We strongly condemn all of Russia's outrageous acts. Amidst Russia's assault, Ukrainians are more united, proud and determined than ever.
3. Russia's war against Ukraine is also an attack on the fundamental principles of sovereignty of nations, territorial integrity of states and respect for human rights. We remain united and resolute in our support of the UN Charter. We reiterate our unequivocal condemnation and firm rejection of the attempted illegal annexation by Russia of Ukraine's Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions. As in the case of Crimea and Sevastopol, we will never recognize these illegal annexation attempts.
4. We reiterate that Russia's irresponsible nuclear rhetoric is unacceptable, and any use of chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear weapons by Russia would be met with severe consequences. We recall the consensus achieved in Bali of all G20 members, including Russia, that the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons is inadmissible. We also recall the importance of the 77-year record of non-use of nuclear weapons. We deeply regret Russia's decision to suspend the implementation of the new START treaty. We express our gravest concern over Russia's continued occupation and control over the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant. The situation can only be resolved by complete withdrawal of Russian troops and equipment from the premises. We support the International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) efforts to strengthen nuclear safety and security in Ukraine, including through the continuous presence of IAEA experts and the cessation of all combat operations in and around the plant and surrounding infrastructure.
5. We welcome the resolution A/ES-11/L.7 titled ""Principles of the Charter of the United Nations underlying a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in Ukraine"" resolution which was adopted with the broad support of the international community at the Emergency Special Session of the UN General Assembly yesterday. We remain committed to diplomacy and welcome and support President Zelenskyy's earnest efforts to promote a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in line with the UN Charter by outlining basic principles in his Peace Formula. With a view to a viable post-war peace settlement, we remain ready to reach arrangements together with Ukraine as well as interested countries and institutions on sustained security and other commitments to help Ukraine defend itself, secure its free and democratic future, and deter future Russian aggression.
6. We remain committed to coordinating efforts to meet Ukraine's pressing military and defence equipment needs, with an immediate focus on air defence systems and capabilities, as well as necessary munitions and tanks.
7. Building on the results achieved during the international conference held in Paris on 13 December, we also reaffirm our commitment to provide additional humanitarian assistance to the Ukrainian people, assistance to support Ukraine's energy sector, and other assistance in Ukraine and neighbouring countries, including to ensure access to healthcare including mental health. We welcome the establishment of the Multi-agency Donor Coordination Platform to help advance Ukraine's reform agenda, promote private sector led sustainable growth, and ensure close coordination among international donors to deliver assistance in a coherent, transparent and accountable manner.
8. We will continue to help maintain Ukraine's economic and financial stability, including addressing urgent short-term economic needs. In this context, we welcome the progress made by our Finance Ministers to increase our budget and economic support to 39 billion US dollars for 2023 and look forward to additional commitments. We ask Finance Ministers to continue engagement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Ukraine to deliver an ambitious program by the end of March 2023 and to continue working together, with the IMF and others for necessary budget support to Ukraine throughout and beyond 2023.
9. We support Ukraine's reconstruction efforts, including the recovery of infrastructure destroyed by Russia's aggression. It is essential that this process continues to involve a wide range of actors, including Ukrainian subnational entities and civil society, international financial institutions and organizations, and the private sector. The Ukraine Recovery Conference to be held in London in June this year will offer a venue for Ukraine, international partners, private sector and civil society to further promote momentum behind Ukraine's recovery. At the same time, we will continue to support the determination of Ukraine to build a society free from corruption. We support the Ukrainian government's efforts to advance necessary institution-building in line with Ukraine's European path, including in the judicial sector and promotion of the rule of law by empowering the independent Ukrainian anti-corruption institutions. In this regard, we reiterate our full confidence in the role of the G7 Ambassadors Group in supporting the implementation of the reform agenda.
10. We reaffirm our commitment to strengthening the unprecedented and coordinated sanctions and other economic measures the G7 and partner countries have taken to date to further counter Russia's capacity to wage its illegal aggression. We remain committed to presenting a united front through the imposition of new coordinated economic actions against Russia in the days and weeks ahead. Specifically, we are taking the following new measures, consistent with our respective legal authorities and processes and international law:
(i) We will maintain, fully implement and expand the economic measures we have already imposed, including by preventing and responding to evasion and circumvention through the establishment of an Enforcement Coordination Mechanism to bolster compliance and enforcement of our measures and deny Russia the benefits of G7 economies. We call on third-countries or other international actors who seek to evade or undermine our measures to cease providing material support to Russia's war, or face severe costs. To deter this activity around the world, we are taking actions against third-country actors materially supporting Russia's war in Ukraine. We also commit to further aligning measures, such as transit or services bans, including to prevent Russian circumvention.
(ii) We are committed to preventing Russia from finding new ways to acquire advanced materials, technology, and military and industrial equipment from our jurisdictions that it can use to develop its industrial sectors and further its violations of international law. To this end, we will adopt further measures to prevent Russia from accessing inputs that support its military and manufacturing sectors, including, among others, industrial machinery, tools, construction equipment, and other technology Russia is exploiting to rebuild its war machine.
(iii) We will continue to reduce Russia's revenue to finance its illegal aggression by taking appropriate steps to limit Russia's energy revenue and future extractive capabilities, building on the measures we have taken so far, including export bans and the price cap for seaborne Russian-origin crude oil and refined oil products. We commit to taking action in a way that mitigates spillover effects for energy security, in particular for the most vulnerable and affected countries.
(iv) Given the significant revenues that Russia extracts from the export of diamonds, we will work collectively on further measures on Russian diamonds, including rough and polished ones, working closely to engage key partners.
(v) We are taking additional measures in relation to Russia's financial sector to further undermine Russia's capacity to wage its illegal aggression. While coordinating to preserve financial channels for essential transactions, we will target additional Russian financial institutions to prevent circumvention of our measures.
(vi) We continue to impose targeted sanctions, including on those responsible for war crimes or human rights violations and abuses, exercising illegitimate authority in Ukraine, or who otherwise are profiting from the war.

11. We will continue our efforts to ensure Russia pays for Ukraine's long-term reconstruction. Russia bears full responsibility for the war and the damage it has caused, including to Ukraine's critical infrastructure. We collectively reaffirm the need for an international mechanism to register the damages Russia has inflicted. We are determined, consistent with our respective legal systems, that Russia's sovereign assets in our jurisdictions will remain immobilized until there is a resolution to the conflict that addresses Russia's violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and integrity. Any resolution to the conflict must ensure Russia pays for the damage it has caused. We will work with partners beyond the G7 which hold those Russian sovereign assets to build the broadest coalition possible to advance these objectives.
12. We are united in our determination to hold President Putin and those responsible to account, consistent with international law. We support investigations by the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, the Prosecutor-General of Ukraine, and other national prosecutors who are able to establish jurisdiction under national law. In this regard, we support exploring efforts to develop an international centre for the prosecution of the crime of aggression against Ukraine (ICPA) which is linked to the existing Joint Investigation Team supported by Eurojust.
13. We deplore that many countries in the world have been severely affected by the repercussions of Russia's war of aggression. Russia's weaponisation of food has caused global economic hardship and a rise in global food prices, increasing the cost of living of people, compounding the economic vulnerabilities of developing countries, and exacerbating already dire humanitarian crises and food insecurity around the world. We reiterate the G7's united will to continue to provide rapid assistance, including food-related aid, to countries in need and affected populations and we will continue to design our restrictive measures to shield such populations from unintended consequences by ensuring food and fertilisers are carved out. We will continue to support food security and the availability and sustainable use of fertilisers to vulnerable countries in need of assistance and welcome the related work undertaken by the UN World Food Programme (WFP) and other relevant agencies. We recognize the importance of the EU-Ukraine Solidarity Lanes, President Zelenskyy's Grain from Ukraine Initiative and the UN and Türkiye- brokered Black Sea Grain Initiative (BSGI). In this context, we stress the importance of the automatic extension of the BSGI by 18 March and its expansion.
14. We also express our profound sympathy for all those affected by the horrifying earthquakes in Türkiye and Syria. We stand in solidarity with the people of Türkiye and Syria and pledge our continued support to tackling the consequences of this catastrophe. It is vital that humanitarian aid reaches all those who require it as efficiently as possible. We welcome the expansion of cross-border aid for an initial period of three months, and underscore that the humanitarian needs of those in northwest Syria should continue to be met. We also welcome the EU initiative to host a donor conference in support of the people in Türkiye and Syria in March.
15. Above all, our solidarity will never waver in standing with Ukraine, in supporting countries and people in need, and in upholding the international order based on the rule of law.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/joint-statement-group-seven-g-7-nations-leaders-statement-the-situation-ukraine
Joe Biden,"February 24, 2023",Interview with David Muir of ABC News,"MUIR: Mr. President, you know, as we sit here today, it was one year ago today, the Russian invasion of Ukraine. You said in Warsaw that Ukraine will never be a victory for Russia. So, how does this war end and what does what's does victory look like?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, that depends on what the Ukrainians decide. But here's what we have to do in the meantime. We have to put the Ukrainians in a position where they can make advances this spring and summer and move to a place where negotiation, they can negotiate from a position of strength. And, but, you know, that expression event heard me use before and others, nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine. We're not going to dictate to them what the end result is.
MUIR: When you talk about them negotiating, does that mean they get to keep Crimea and parts of the east?
THE PRESIDENT: That means they decide that. They, the Ukrainians, decide that. But I could picture a circumstance where there's a transition to that. It's not all one time. Look, a year ago today, they were only 70 kilometers from the border where Russians expected to come rolling down into Kyiv and own it all. They got pushed back. It didn't happen. And I think they underestimated a great deal, the Russians did.
MUIR: You announced another $2.5 billion in aid to Ukraine today, $113 billion now. We know the vast majority of Americans support Ukraine. But there are now many who are asking, how long can we spend like this?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, first of all, I'm not sure how many are asking that. I know the MAGA crowd is. The right-wing Republicans are, you know, talking about, we can't do this. We find ourselves in a situation where the cost of doing, walking away could be considerably higher than the cost of helping Ukraine maintain its independence.
MUIR: We know the Germans are now sending tanks in after the US said it would send Abrams tanks as well. But we know what President Zelenskyy continues the say what we really needs are F-16s. Will you send F-16s?
THE PRESIDENT: Look, we're sending him what our seasoned military thinks he needs now. He needs tanks, he needs artillery, he needs air defense, including another HIMAR. But there are things he needs now that we're sending him to put him in a position to be able to make gains this spring and this summer going into the fall.
MUIR: You don't think he needs F-16s now?
THE PRESIDENT: No, he doesn't need F-16s now.
MUIR: Is that a never?
THE PRESIDENT: Look, first of all, the idea that we know exactly what's going to be needed a year or two, three from now, but there is no basis upon which there is a rationale according to our military now to provide F-16s.
MUIR: But you're not ruling it out.
THE PRESIDENT: I am ruling it out for now.
MUIR: For now. Vladimir Putin told the Russian people this week that China's President Xi is coming to Russia, likely as early as this spring. I know the State Department and the Pentagon now have both warned China not to offer lethal military assistance to Russia in this war with Ukraine, saying the US is concerned China is considering providing lethal support to Russia. Would that cross a line for you?
THE PRESIDENT: Look, it's not on China's, I had a very frank conversation with President Xi this past summer on this issue. And I pointed out to him, the conversation went like this. I said, Mr. President this is not a threat, it's an assertion, a statement what I think the reality is. You saw what happened when the rest of the world, Europe in particular, saw the brutality of what Putin was doing in Ukraine, to the Ukrainians from Russia. And I said, without any government prodding, 600 American corporations left Russia, from McDonald's to Exxon, to across the board. And I said, and if you are engaged in the same kind of brutality by supporting the brutality that's going on, I said, you may face the same consequence. I don't anticipate, we haven't seen it yet, but I don't anticipate a major initiative on the part of China providing weaponry to, to Russia.
MUIR: But if they did, would that be crossing a line for you, Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT: It would be the same line everyone else would have crossed. In other words, we'd impose severe sanctions on anyone who has done that.
MUIR: So, there would be severe consequences?
THE PRESIDENT: I'll let you characterize what they would be. We would respond.
MUIR: I ask you all of this because there's a new report in a German newspaper, ""Der Spiegel,"" that the Russian military could be negotiating right now with a Chinese drone manufacturer to produce kamikaze drones for Russia. Are you aware of this? Is US intelligence tracking this?
THE PRESIDENT: US intelligence is aware of everything that's going on in this area, but I'm not going to confirm specifically what US intelligence has found out or not found out.
MUIR: What do you make of this Chinese peace plan that floated overnight that Putin is applauding today?
THE PRESIDENT: I think you answered the question. Putin is applauding it, so how could it be any good? I'm not being facetious. I'm being deadly earnest. I've seen nothing in the plan that would indicate that there is something that would be beneficial to anyone other than Russia if the Chinese plan were followed. The idea that China is going to be negotiating the outcome of a war that's a totally unjust war for Ukraine is just not rational.
MUIR: Let me ask about US-China relations in general, already strained after the Chinese spy balloon over the US. Let me just ask you this first, do we know definitively yet whether or not that spy balloon was flying over the continental US intentionally?
THE PRESIDENT: It is almost not relevant once it was over the United States.
MUIR: So, there's a possibility President Xi didn't know.
THE PRESIDENT: There is a possibility of that.
MUIR: Were they surveilling the US or attempting to?
THE PRESIDENT: That's what that balloon does, surveillance.
MUIR: Let me ask you, when the balloon was shot down off South Carolina, the defense secretary placed a call to his Chinese counterpart on a line that's supposed to always be open. The Chinese did not take the call. They didn't pick up the phone. Does that trouble you?
THE PRESIDENT: Yes. There should be a direct open line of communications, particularly from two most powerful nations in the world to be able to resolve anything quickly so there's not a mistake made.
MUIR: The defense secretary says they still haven't had that call. How does the US, how does your administration fix this?
THE PRESIDENT: We make it clear that it's necessary for that to occur. We can't fix it.
MUIR: I want to ask you about a couple of issues here at home. It's been three weeks now since the toxic train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, as you know. The mayor says he saw you in Ukraine and he says, it tells you he doesn't care about us. They're asking, is the President coming to Ohio? Do you have any plan to travel to Ohio? And have you talked with the mayor yet?
THE PRESIDENT: Let's put this in perspective. Within two hours of that derailment, the EPA was in there, within two hours. Every major agency in the United States government that had anything to do with rail and/or cleanup was there and is there. In addition to that, I've spoken at length to the congresspersons, the governors, the senators from both states of Pennsylvania and, and in Ohio, and I've made it clear to them anything they need is available or will make it available. Whatever happens, you've got to understand, it's the responsibility of the railroad company who's made, by the way, tens of billions of dollars in profits. Tens of billions of dollars in profits lately.
MUIR: So, do you plan to travel there and have you talked to the mayor?
THE PRESIDENT: I can't recall. I don't think aye I've talked to the mayor there. I've talked to both the senators, both governors, everyone there is to talk to, and we made it clear that everything is available.
MUIR: Let me ask you the question everyone is asking, are you running?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, apparently, someone interviewed my wife today I heard.
MUIR: I heard that, too, just before I came in.
THE PRESIDENT: I got to call her and find out. No, all kidding aside. My intention from the beginning has been from the beginning to run, but there's too many other things I have to finish in the near term before I started campaigning.
MUIR: But let me ask you, you brought up your wife, the first lady, Jill Biden, obviously, traveling in Kenya. She was asked just today, is all that's left at this point simply setting a time and place for the announcement? And she said, pretty much. Do you agree with your wife's assessment?
THE PRESIDENT: I say, God love her. Yeah. Look, I meant what I said. I've got other things to finish before I get into a full-blown campaign.
MUIR: Let me ask you about a conversation that people are having at home. Both your supporters and your critics. They know if you're re-elected you would be 82 when sworn in, you would be 86 at the end of your term. Is your age part of your own calculation into whether to run again?
THE PRESIDENT: No. But it's legitimate for people to raise questions about my age. It's totally legitimate to do that. And the only thing I can say is, watch me.
MUIR: Let me ask you one of the immediate questions if and when you do announce you're running again. You and the former president are now under investigation by the Justice Department for the discovery of these classified documents. I know that you believe these two cases are very different. But I do remember something you said after the discovery at Mar-a-Lago. You said, I thought data that was in there may compromise sources and methods and names of people who help, and it's just totally irresponsible. Can you assure the American people that none of the documents discovered in your garage or at your old office compromised sources or methods or US intelligence?
THE PRESIDENT: I've been advised by the counsel, let the Justice Department make that decision, to not try to alter the case in any way. There have been very few documents that have been confiscated, found in my possession that were in other than in my possession, meaning in my home. All the stuff that was moved out of my Senate office over the years, I'm told there were a couple of things from 1973 or '74 documents were marked classified. I don't know of anything maybe, I don't know of anything that is marked like it was, top secret, highly et cetera. But I'm told not to comment on that, because I don't even know what they were able to, what they confiscated.
MUIR: There are many who will understand why you can't comment, why your lawyers are saying not to comment. They also saw you, though, comment on former President Trump. And so, at the very least...
THE PRESIDENT: Because they were showing, you guys were showing on television things lying on the ground that said top secret, national, you know, code word. And the difference is, every single solitary thing I have been asked to do, I've done voluntarily. I've invited the Justice Department to come into every aspect of any place that I had any control off. There was no need for search warrants, no need, what do you need? Just come. Whatever you want. Whatever you want, wherever you want to go, you can go. That was totally different.
MUIR: But that one word you used, when you hear about boxes in your garage or in your old office, you called the Trump discovery irresponsible. Is there something irresponsible here, though, too?
THE PRESIDENT: You know, you're a good lawyer, but you're trying to make a comparison. What, there's degrees of irresponsibility. They can be significant degrees of irresponsibility. What, the way in which the boxes were packed up from my office, apparently not everything was gone through as meticulously as it should have, but there was no intention. I opened up my home, all my homes the home at the beach and the home that I, my permanent home. And they spent hours and hours going through everything, personal everything I had. And that's a fundamentally different thing. There's nothing for me to hide.
MUIR: Let me ask you about a conversation that people are having at home. Both your supporters and your critics. They know that if you're re-elected you would be 82 when you're sworn in, you'd be 86 at the end of your term. Is your age part of your own calculation into whether to run again?
THE PRESIDENT: No, but it's legitimate for people to raise issues about my age. It's totally legitimate to do that. And the only thing I can say is, watch me.
MUIR: I want to ask about the economy. You talk often about how the inflation – the rate of inflation has begun to slow. Unemployment now at its lowest level in 50 years. But you've also seen the polls. Our latest ABC News poll shows four in 10 Americans say they're worse off than when you were elected. Only 16 percent said they were better off. So, why is that? Why aren't Americans feeling this?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, look, I think it goes well beyond the economy. Think about it. You make the – I mean you interview for the news. Can you think of anything you turn on the television and go, God, that makes me feel good? Almost anything? Everything is in the negative. We're also finding out now that one of the outlets has decided that they even put things on they know to be false in order to increase their ratings. So, I think things are a little out of whack. And I don't blame people for being down. You know, when you had a year, two years of the pandemic, kids out of school, the mental health problems in the country are seriously increased, especially among young people. Some things are, for example, even feeling down about unemployment. They've got better jobs, are making more money. Inflation is still higher than it should be, and, you know, everything from gasoline prices, to a war going on in Ukraine. I mean, so I can't think of a time when there's been a greater uncertainty, notwithstanding the fact we're created 800,000 manufacturing jobs. We're better off than virtually any other major nation in the world, economically. But it's understandable why people are just down.
MUIR: I know this a defining moment in this war. We watched your speech here in Warsaw. And as you know, just hours before Vladimir Putin gave his own speech. And I wanted to ask you about something Vladimir Putin said. He said that Russia is suspending participation, cooperation, in the nuclear treaty with the United States. What's your message to Putin on that?
THE PRESIDENT: It's a big mistake to do that. Not very responsible. And, but I don't read into that that he's thinking of using nuclear weapons or anything like that. I think it's a, I'm not sure what else he was able to say in a speech at the moment. But I think it's a mistake. And I'm confident we'll be able to work it out.
MUIR: He is saying he's going to suspend participation in this nuclear treaty. Rhetoric is one thing, but we're a year into this war now. Does it concern you when he says something like this? And are we less safe?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, look. I think we're less safe when we walk away from arms control agreements that are very much in both parties' interest, and the world's interest. But I've not seen anything, we've not seen anything, where there's a change in his posture and what they're doing. The idea that somehow this means they're thinking of using nuclear weapons, international continental ballistic missiles, there's no evidence of that.
MUIR: The world watched this surprise visit to Kyiv. How risky was it for a sitting President of the United States to go into Kyiv?
THE PRESIDENT: I didn't think it was that risky.
MUIR: You like a train?
THE PRESIDENT: Not 20 hours' worth, though.
MUIR: With those air sirens, those air raid sirens overhead in Kyiv, how important was it that the world saw you standing next to President Zelenskyy?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, look, I think that's for, I'm not being facetious, folks like you decide how important that is. It was important to me to stand with Zelenskyy and let the world know, on the year anniversary, we're not walking away from Ukraine.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-david-muir-abc-news-0
Joe Biden,"March 08, 2023",Statement on International Women's Day,"International Women's Day honors a truth we live every day: that women and girls are essential to success and progress in every aspect of our society. Promoting opportunities for women and girls strengthens security, stability, and prosperity for everyone. And we know that we cannot solve any of the great global challenges of our time if half the population is left behind. So today, as we celebrate the accomplishments and contributions of women and girls around the world, we also reaffirm our commitment to ensuring that all people can reach their full potential.
Despite decades of progress, in far too many places around the world, the rights of women and girls are still under attack, holding back entire communities. We see it in Afghanistan, where the Taliban bars women and girls from attending school and pursuing employment. We see it in Iran, where the regime is brutally repressing the voices of women who are courageously standing up for their freedom. And in the face of Russia's vicious and unjust invasion of Ukraine, including the use of rape as a weapon of war, we see countless stories of women bravely fighting for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all Ukrainians.
The United States stands with women and girls around the world in the critical work of protecting and advancing human rights. My administration is working with dedicated partners and local communities in every part of the world to expand economic security for women and girls, defend access to health care—including reproductive health care—safeguard women's political participation and human rights, and promote the full participation of women and girls in all facets of society. Through initiatives like the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, we are supporting the infrastructure of the care economy in low- and middle-income countries. We have also redoubled our commitment to eliminating gender-based violence wherever it occurs, promoting accountability for conflict-related sexual violence, and expanding protection services for women and girls in humanitarian emergences.
Here in the United States, we have made landmark investments to give families more breathing room and support women's participation in the labor force. This includes signing into law important workplace protections for pregnant and nursing workers in the United States. And last year, I was particularly proud to sign legislation strengthening and reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), and increasing VAWA funding to $700 million, the highest funding level in history. This critical legislation will advance access to services, justice, and healing for survivors.
As we continue working to implement our first-ever National Strategy on Gender Equity and Equality, we are focused on lifting up the rights of women and girls through every aspect of both our foreign and domestic policy. This is a defining feature of who we are as a nation and the values we hold dear as Americans. So let us continue to strive toward a future where women have an equal seat at the table, an equal voice in shaping decisions, and an equal opportunity to contribute fully to their nations.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-international-womens-day-8
Joe Biden,"March 10, 2023",Joint Statement by President Biden and President Ursula von der Leyen of the European Commission,"The United States and the European Union share the most comprehensive and dynamic economic relationship in the world. Our partnership is based on shared values and principles, including the responsibility to protect our planet for future generations and defend our workers. Today, the United States and the European Union are taking new steps to deepen our economic relationship as we build the clean energy economies of the future and address shared economic and national security challenges.
Building the Clean Economies of the Future 
The United States and European Union are committed to addressing the climate crisis, accelerating the global clean energy economy, and building resilient, secure, and diversified clean energy supply chains. Both parties recognize that these objectives are at the heart of the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act and the EU Green Deal Industrial Plan. By building and strengthening our own clean energy industrial bases and investing in the industries of the future, the United States and the European Union will create good-paying jobs and spark virtuous cycles of innovation that drive down costs for clean energy technologies in the global market, making those technologies more affordable and advancing a global just energy transition that will leave no community behind.
The EU-U.S. Task Force on the Inflation Reduction Act has productively deepened our partnership on these common goals, and has taken practical steps forward on identified challenges to align our approaches on strengthening and securing supply chains, manufacturing, and innovation on both sides of the Atlantic.
We will deepen our cooperation on diversifying critical mineral and battery supply chains, recognizing the substantial opportunities on both sides of the Atlantic to build out these supply chains in a strong, secure, and resilient manner. To that end, we intend to immediately begin negotiations on a targeted critical minerals agreement for the purpose of enabling relevant critical minerals extracted or processed in the European Union to count toward requirements for clean vehicles in the Section 30D clean vehicle tax credit of the Inflation Reduction Act. This kind of agreement would further our shared goals of boosting our mineral production and processing and expanding access to sources of critical minerals that are sustainable, trusted, and free of labor abuses. Cooperation is also necessary to reduce unwanted strategic dependencies in these supply chains, and to ensure that they are diversified and developed with trusted partners.
We further recognize the need to make bold investments to build clean energy economies and industrial bases, including in electric vehicle batteries and clean hydrogen. Today, the United States and the European Commission announced the launch of the Clean Energy Incentives Dialogue to coordinate our respective incentive programs so that they are mutually reinforcing. Both sides will take steps to avoid any disruptions in transatlantic trade and investment flows that could arise from their respective incentives. We are working against zero-sum competition so that our incentives maximize clean energy deployment and jobs—and do not lead to windfalls for private interests. The Clean Energy Incentives Dialogue will become a part of the EU-U.S. Trade and Technology Council where it will also facilitate information-sharing on non-market policies and practices of third parties—such as those employed by the People's Republic of China (PRC)—to serve as the basis for joint or parallel action and coordinated advocacy on these issues in multilateral or other fora.
We are committed to achieving an ambitious outcome in the Global Arrangement on Sustainable Steel and Aluminum negotiations by October 2023. The arrangement will ensure the long-term viability of our industries, encourage low-carbon intensity steel and aluminum production and trade, and restore market-oriented conditions globally and bilaterally. Together, we will incentivize emission reductions in these carbon-intensive sectors and level the playing field for our workers. The arrangement will be open to all partners demonstrating commitment to countering non-market excess capacity and reducing carbon-intensity in these sectors.
We are working together to support countries around the world as they develop their economies to deliver inclusive and resilient growth, while fostering sustainable pathways to net zero emissions as well as boosting the security of global supply chains. Through the G7 Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, we are identifying opportunities to generate significantly more public and private financing for quality climate and energy security investments in developing countries. We are also advancing an ambitious agenda to evolve the multilateral development banks, starting with the World Bank, to better respond to global challenges like climate change, while also enhancing their work on poverty alleviation and meeting the Sustainable Development Goals.
Recognizing our shared history as well as our joint visions for the future, we believe that people to people exchanges strengthen the transatlantic partnership, especially for younger generations. We will discuss how to deepen our cooperation.
Standing Together to End Russia's War Against Ukraine 
The United States and the European Union have taken a strong and united stand against Russia's illegal, unjustifiable, and unprovoked war against Ukraine. We, along with a broad coalition of partners, have imposed swift and sweeping sanctions that are reducing Russia's revenue to fund its war and its military-industrial base. Putin thought that he would divide us, and yet we are more united than ever. We stand together in our unwavering support for Ukraine for as long as it takes.
One year ago, the United States and the European Commission launched a new partnership to rapidly reduce Europe's dependence on Russian fossil fuels and accelerate Europe's green transition. This partnership has exceeded our goals, delivering more than double the U.S. liquefied natural gas supplies to Europe than our baseline pledge. We note the significant European efforts to diversify their energy supplies and accelerate the energy transition, which have helped limit the impact of the global energy crisis in Europe. We will continue to work together to advance energy security and sustainability in Europe by diversifying sources, lowering energy consumption, and reducing Europe's dependence on fossil fuels. We will also continue our close coordination to support Ukraine's energy security through its further integration into Europe's energy markets. We will continue our cooperation for stable and balanced global markets and security of supply and step up the clean energy transition globally, including by efforts to reduce methane emissions in the energy sector.
We have also taken unprecedented, coordinated, and effective sanctions and other economic measures together to further degrade Russia's capacity to wage its illegal war and its military-industrial system. We are deepening our joint work to aggressively enforce our sanctions and export control measures and also to end and deter circumvention and backfill, including by expanded authorities to close down Russia's access to all inputs that can support its war machine. As part of this, we are taking new steps together to target additional third-country actors across the globe to disrupt support for Russia's war from any corner of the world where it is identified. We are working in lockstep to limit Russian revenue even further while ensuring continued energy supplies to emerging market and developing countries via the G7+ price cap for seaborne Russian-origin crude oil and petroleum products. We will continue to work together to strengthen our economic restrictions to ensure that the costs to Russia of its illegal war continue to grow.
The United States and European Union are working to ensure that Ukraine has the security, economic, and humanitarian support it needs for as long as it takes. We have worked together to supply the Ukrainian Armed Forces with the military equipment and training it needs to defend itself from Russian aggression. We, together with Ukraine, are co-chairing the Multi-agency Donor Coordination Platform, and, in line with its European path, are helping advance Ukraine's reform agenda, laying the foundation for sustainable growth and reconstruction, and ensuring assistance is delivered in a coherent, transparent, and accountable manner. We remain committed to providing and mobilizing international support including from the private sector for Ukraine's economic and financial stability. We support the International Monetary Fund delivering an ambitious program by end March 2023 to provide necessary budget support to Ukraine throughout and beyond 2023.
Strengthening Economic Security and National Security 
The United States and the European Union are working to reinforce, through transatlantic cooperation, our essential security interests and the resilience of our economies. We affirm that our cooperation to strengthen our economic security and national security should be rooted in maintaining the rules-based system. We will continue our work through the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council and the G7 and strengthen our bilateral coordination by tasking our Sherpas to formulate key recommendations on economic security by the summer.
We will continue work to strengthen our economic security, responding to concrete threats we have identified. The United States and the European Union share concerns about the challenges posed by, among other issues, economic coercion, the weaponization of economic dependencies, and non-market policies and practices. We will continue our work through the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council and the G7 to strengthen coordination with each other and other likeminded partners to diversify our supply chains, and to increase our collective preparedness, resilience, and deterrence to non-market policies and practices and to economic coercion.
We are increasing our cooperation to prevent the leakage of sensitive emerging technologies, as well as other dual-use items, to destinations of concern that operate civil-military fusion strategies. Our respective existing controls related to exports, inbound investment, and research cooperation are essential tools and need to be upgraded to correspond to a changing geostrategic environment. We have a common interest in preventing our companies' capital, expertise, and knowledge from fueling technological advances that will enhance the military and intelligence capabilities of our strategic rivals, including through outbound investment. As we develop and upgrade our toolkit, we will coordinate efforts across the Atlantic to avoid the backfilling of any controlled exports and investments and will continue to share lessons and seek to align our approaches where feasible to maximize the effectiveness of our efforts.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/joint-statement-president-biden-and-president-ursula-von-der-leyen-the-european-3
Joe Biden,"March 24, 2023",Joint Statement by President Biden and Prime Minister Justin P.J. Trudeau of Canada,"The United States and Canada celebrate our progress under the Roadmap for a Renewed U.S.-Canada Partnership over the past two years and reaffirm our historic alliance, steadfast friendship, and commitment to overcome the daunting challenges of today and realize the full potential of the relationship in the future. Our enduring partnership is based on a mutual commitment to shared security, shared prosperity, and shared democratic values, including the importance of fighting climate change and an abiding respect for human rights and the rule of law. As the closest of friends and allies, we remain committed to making life better for people on both sides of our shared border and to building a more free, equitable, secure, and prosperous world.
To that end, the United States and Canada will work together to:
1. Catalyze Clean Energy and Create Good Jobs: Deepening economic integration, accelerating the deployment of clean technologies, and workforce development are essential to building a more sustainable and globally competitive economy for American and Canadian workers, including through continued implementation of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement.
President Biden and Prime Minister Trudeau highlighted the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act and Canada's Emissions Reduction Plan as foundational elements to leading the clean energy future through robust clean energy industrial policies that help mobilize technological innovation, bolster resilient supply chains, strengthen our respective economies and expand the middle class, while keeping our environment healthy for future generations. Canada is moving forward with an enhanced plan to support a clean economy future, including with a new investment tax credit for clean technology manufacturing in addition to tax measures that support clean hydrogen and clean technology adoption. As the implementation of these plans proceed, the United States and Canada will work together toward an integrated North American approach that benefits U.S. and Canadian workers, suppliers, and products. 
The United States and Canada launched a one-year Energy Transformation Task Force chaired by the U.S. Special Presidential Coordinator for Global Infrastructure and Canada's Deputy Prime Minister to work across the spectrum of the clean economy. The task force will accelerate cooperation on critical clean energy opportunities and supply chains, including but not limited to, securing and strengthening renewable energy and electric vehicle supply chains, critical minerals and rare earths, grid integration and resilience, advanced and conventional nuclear energy and other areas that advance our collective energy security, and to avoid and reduce disruptions to our integrated and mutually supportive supply chains. 
The United States and Canada have built the world's largest market-based energy trading relationship, which provides a firm foundation as we strive to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions. Both countries will work to harmonize charging standards and develop cross-border alternative fuel corridors, drawing on USD $7.5 billion in the U.S. Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and CAD $1.2 billion in Canadian funding to build a network of electric vehicle fast chargers and community charging options on both sides of the border.
Building on Canadian and U.S. commitments to achieve net-zero power grids by 2035 and to accelerate efforts to phase down new, unabated coal power generation facilities, both countries intend to propose regulations before this fall that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions from their respective sectors. The United States and Canada also intend to work with other major energy importers and exporters to develop an internationally aligned approach to measurement, monitoring, reporting, and verification for lifecycle methane and CO2 emissions across the fossil energy value chain. 
The United States and Canada will work together to address the climate impact of goods, promote North American trade of low-emissions goods, including the promotion of common approaches for trade in low emissions goods, including green steel and aluminum. 
On civil nuclear engagement, Canada will join the Foundational Infrastructure for Responsible Use of Small Modular Reactor Technology (FIRST) program, providing funding and in-kind support. The United States and Canada will also coordinate efforts to develop secure and reliable North American nuclear fuel supply chains and build broader partnerships with longstanding allies and partners, both of which will help to ensure access to low enriched uranium, including High-Assay Low Enriched Uranium. 
2. Strengthen Resilience of Critical Mineral and Semiconductor Supply Chains: The United States and Canada will work together to create a strong, environmentally responsible, and resilient North American critical minerals supply chain. We are committed to identifying, securing, and developing critical minerals extraction, processing, manufacturing, and recycling opportunities in both countries to diversify supply chains essential to clean energy, electric vehicles, semiconductors, aerospace, and defense, among other sectors, that meet strong environmental, sustainability, worker, health and safety, Indigenous and Tribal consultation and partnership, and community engagement standards.
Canada and the United States are taking a significant step toward the creation of reliable and sustainable critical mineral supply chains that are vital to our economic and national security and demonstrate the commitment of the United States to support Canadian companies in the energy economy. 
Last year, the United States announced USD $250 million of Defense Production Act Title III funding for U.S. and Canadian companies to mine and process critical minerals for electric vehicle and stationary storage batteries, with awards to U.S. and Canadian companies to be announced this spring. 
The Canadian Critical Minerals Infrastructure Fund will make CAD $1.5 billion available to support clean energy and transportation infrastructure projects necessary to accelerate critical minerals production and an additional CAD $1.5 billion through the Strategic Innovation Fund to support advanced manufacturing, processing, and recycling. 
With the passage of the CHIPS and Science Act, the United States and Canada will facilitate investment to promote secure and resilient semiconductor supply chains, creating jobs in both countries. Both countries will advance a cross-border packaging corridor, beginning with Canada and IBM providing a significant investment to develop new and expanded packaging and testing capabilities at its Bromont facility as part of a Memorandum of Understanding.
To strengthen advanced packaging for semiconductors and printed circuit boards in North America, the United States announced an additional USD $50 million in Defense Production Act funding for U.S. and Canadian companies to advance packaging for semiconductors and printed circuit boards, with Canada to provide up to CAD $250 million for semiconductor projects from the Strategic Innovation Fund in the near term. We are also establishing an Advanced Technology Data and Security Dialogue and intend to deepen our collaboration on shared priorities in quantum information science and technology. 
3. Protecting Our Shared Waters and the Arctic: The United States and Canada committed to fight climate change and build net-zero economies, conserve biodiversity, and protect fragile ecosystems, including in transboundary waters and the Arctic.
Recognizing the vulnerability of the unique, shared Arctic ecosystem, Canada and the United States committed to advancing conservation, environmental protection and resilience in partnership and consultation with the Indigenous peoples and populations, and furthering work under agreements and treaties established around the movement of shared species 
The United States and Canada further committed to initiating dialogue with other Arctic Nations and Indigenous peoples to advance conservation and sustainable economic development in the Central Arctic Ocean, and recognized the need to conserve and protect Arctic ecosystems and reduce localized emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and black carbon in the Arctic to complement our global mitigation efforts. The two countries will collaborate to prepare for, prevent, and respond to oil spills and other environmental disasters in the Arctic. 
The United States and Canada announced a renewed commitment to preserving and restoring our shared national treasure, the Great Lakes. The United States welcomed Canada's announcement of a new, historic investment of CAD $420 million over the next decade as part of this shared responsibility to protect and restore the world's largest freshwater ecosystem. The U.S. Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provided the largest single investment in the Great Lakes in history, with USD $1 billion for cleanup and restoration activities. 
The United States and Canada will intensify their work over the coming months toward agreement on a modernized treaty regime that will support a healthy and prosperous Columbia River Basin. We will focus on flood risk management, power generation, and environmental benefits that are shared equitably by both countries and the Indigenous peoples and Tribal nations, communities, and stakeholders in this watershed. The Columbia River is a vital shared resource that underpins many lives and industries on both sides of the border and the watershed requires our attention and prompt coordination. 
The United States and Canada also intend to reach an agreement in principle by this summer to reduce and mitigate the impacts of water pollution in the Elk-Kootenai watershed, in partnership with Tribal Nations and Indigenous Peoples, and in order to protect the people and species that depend on this vital river system. 
4. Advancing Diversity and Inclusion: Recognizing the central importance of inclusion and equal opportunity to our democracies, Canada and the United States will continue to work toward fair and inclusive policies that benefit all citizens, regardless of sex, gender, or sexual orientation; race, ethnicity, or religion; age; disability; or geography.
Building on previous bilateral and North American commitments, the Leaders reaffirmed their shared determination to promote equality and ensuring everyone lives free from discrimination, harassment, or violence. Canada and the United States remain committed to ensuring the full, equal, and meaningful participation of marginalized communities in our societies. 
The Leaders reaffirmed their shared commitment to promoting gender equality and empowering women and girls as essential for achieving a more peaceful, inclusive, and prosperous world. They underscored the importance of continued cooperation on the advancement of gender equity, including with respect to child benefits, early learning and childcare, pay equity, and women's entrepreneurship, among other issues. 
5. Bolster Global Alliances: The United States and Canada are committed to the security of our treaty allies, including through the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and to supporting our partners around the world. We are even stronger through our collaboration at and with the United Nations and other international organizations, alliances, and groups, including the G7, G20, the Five Eyes, and the Organization of American States.
We condemn Russia for its illegal, unjustifiable, and unprovoked war against Ukraine, and will continue imposing economic costs on Russia, while maintaining our unwavering support for Ukraine for as long as it takes. 
Canada and the United States acknowledge the serious long-term challenge to the international order posed by the People's Republic of China, including disruptive actions such as economic coercion, non-market policies and practices, and human rights abuses. While we will cooperate with China in areas of mutual interest, such as on climate change, we remain committed to ensuring our ability to compete effectively with China on a level playing field. Canada and the United States will also continue to cooperate on countering foreign interference in our societies in a manner that reflects our shared democratic values. 
We emphasize that our basic positions on Taiwan remain unchanged, and reiterate the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait as an indispensable element of security and prosperity in the international community. We encourage the peaceful resolution of cross-Strait issues. 
The President and Prime Minister reaffirmed their commitment to the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity, and welcomed the first U.S.-Canada Indo-Pacific Strategic Dialogue on March 10 and will cooperate to promote a free, open, prosperous, secure, and resilient Indo-Pacific. 
The United States and Canada are working together to support countries around the world as they develop their economies to deliver inclusive and resilient growth, while fostering sustainable pathways to net zero emissions. Through the G7 Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, we are collaborating to unlock public and private capital for quality infrastructure to create lasting positive impacts for low- and middle-income countries and support sustainable development, as well as benefit partners' economic security and global supply chains. We are also advancing an ambitious agenda to evolve the multilateral development banks, starting with the World Bank, to better respond to global challenges, while also enhancing their work on poverty alleviation and meeting the Sustainable Development Goals.
The United States and Canada also remain concerned about deteriorating security in Haiti, committed to increasing international support for the Haitian people, including through security and humanitarian assistance, enhanced support for the Haitian National Police, and by holding accountable those who undermine Haiti's stability. 
6. Invest in Our Collective Defense and Security: Our highest priority is to protect our citizens and our sovereign territory. We will invest in the modernization of the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), including specifically
As part of a CAD $6.96 billion investment in surveillance system modernization, procuring and fielding two next generation Over-the-Horizon Radar (OTHR) systems covering the Arctic and Polar approaches, the first by 2028 to enhance early warning and domain awareness of North American approaches; 
CAD $7.3 billion in investments in the northern forward operating locations to support 5th generation aircraft and mobility/refueling assets, which capabilities should be in place prior to the arrival of the F-35 aircraft, including airfield improvements to accommodate aircraft personnel, fuel, and munitions, to ensure NORAD's ability to deter and defend against emerging threats to our air and sea space and compete with China and Russia for years to come. 
The Prime Minister confirmed that the funding for these investments would come from Canada's planned investments in defense infrastructure. These U.S. and Canadian efforts will bolster NORAD's ability to detect threats earlier and more precisely and respond effectively. In the face of global threats, the Leaders acknowledged the importance of investment in modern, ready, and capable forces in line with their commitments to NATO under the 2014 Wales Summit Defence Investment Pledge. Such investments enable effective contributions to NATO, United Nations, and other global missions. 
The Leaders recognized the need to work in close collaboration to combat all criminal activity in our combined jurisdiction. The Cross-Border Crime Forum is key to the safety of both countries, by facilitating cooperation to reduce violent extremism, child sex exploitation, cross-border smuggling, and firearms violence on both sides of the border. 
Cyber threats can impact both Americans and Canadians, particularly when directed at cross-border systems on which we all rely. 
To better protect against these threats, we will deepen our cooperation on driving improvements to the cybersecurity and resiliency of our critical infrastructure. 
We will focus on two key sectors—pipelines and electricity—due to their criticality to our economies and their cross border nature. Further, we reiterate that in each of our countries, should an adversary choose to target critical infrastructure systems, we will both respond. 
7. Disrupt the Illicit Production and Distribution of Synthetic Opioids: The opioid overdose crisis is having devastating health and economic consequences in our societies. We are united in our resolve to disrupt the illicit production and distribution of synthetic opioids like fentanyl and its precursor chemicals while augmenting our public health response.
Canada and the United States will expand multi-agency cooperation to improve intelligence sharing on cross-border fentanyl and precursor chemical trafficking to support interdictions and investigations, as part of our effort to bolster cooperation under U.S.-Canada Opioids Action Plan. 
Canada will join the United States as it builds a global coalition against synthetic drugs, underscoring U.S. and Canadian leadership in response to this shared security and public health challenge. The United States and Canada reaffirm their commitment from the tenth North American Leaders' Summit to work with Mexico trilaterally to defeat the synthetic opioid crisis. 
8. Manage Migration Collaboratively: The Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection enshrines our belief that irregular migration requires a regional approach centered on expanding legal pathways and humane border management and recognizes that we must address the underlying economic and security drivers of migration. The United States and Canada remain committed partners in advancing the principles of the Declaration.
As part of its commitment to these principles, Canada will welcome an additional 15,000 migrants on a humanitarian basis from the Western Hemisphere over the course of the year to continue expanding safe, regular pathways offered throughout the hemisphere as an alternative to irregular migration, with a path to economic opportunities 
Additionally, U.S. and Canadian officials are now poised to implement an agreement to apply the terms of the Safe Third Country Agreement to asylum seekers who cross between ports of entry, which we anticipate will deter irregular migration at our shared border. We will remain in close coordination as we work to implement this new agreement.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/joint-statement-president-biden-and-prime-minister-justin-pj-trudeau-canada
Joe Biden,"April 04, 2023",Statement on Finland's Accession to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization,"Today I am proud to welcome Finland as NATO's 31st ally.
Seventy-four years ago today, as the United States and 11 other nations came together to form the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, President Truman said, ""if there is anything inevitable in the future, it is the will of the people of the world for freedom and for peace."" Today that will is stronger than ever with the addition of Finland to NATO.
In May 2022, Finland and Sweden applied for NATO membership. Both countries are strong democracies with highly capable militaries, who share our values and vision for the world. Less than a year later, we are welcoming Finland as a member, the fastest ratification process in NATO's modern history. I look forward to welcoming Sweden as a NATO member as soon as possible, and encourage Turkiye and Hungary to conclude their ratification processes without delay.
When Putin launched his brutal war of aggression against the people of Ukraine, he thought he could divide Europe and NATO. He was wrong. Today, we are more united than ever. And together—strengthened by our newest ally, Finland—we will continue to preserve transatlantic security, defend every inch of NATO territory, and meet any and all challenges we face.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-finlands-accession-the-north-atlantic-treaty-organization

Joe Biden,"April 26, 2023",Joint Statement by President Biden and President Yoon Suk Yeol of South Korea Commemorating the 70th Anniversary of the Alliance Between the United States and South Korea,"Today President Joseph R. Biden Jr. of the United States (U.S.) and President Yoon Suk Yeol of the Republic of Korea (ROK) met in Washington to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the U.S.-ROK Alliance. This is the second State Visit of the Biden-Harris Administration. While our two nations are inseparably tied by our deep and unwavering security cooperation—reinforced today by the Presidents' commitments in the Washington Declaration to develop ever-stronger mutual defense and deterrence—the greatest success of the Alliance is its clear and expanding focus on achieving a secure and brighter future for the American and Korean people.

President Biden and President Yoon affirmed the need to make bold investments to build clean energy economies and to build and strengthen mutually beneficial supply chain ecosystems for our critical technologies. In that regard, the two leaders appreciated the recent efforts made by the ROK and the United States to alleviate concerns of Korean businesses over the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the CHIPS and Science Act.

Joe Biden,"May 19, 2023",Joint Statement—Group of Seven (G-7) Nations Leaders' Hiroshima Vision on Nuclear Disarmament,"We, the Leaders of the G7, met at a historical juncture in Hiroshima, which together with Nagasaki offers a reminder of the unprecedented devastation and immense human suffering the people of Hiroshima and Nagasaki experienced as a result of the atomic bombings of 1945. In a solemn and reflective moment, we reaffirm, in this first G7 Leaders' document with a particular focus on nuclear disarmament, our commitment to achieving a world without nuclear weapons with undiminished security for all.
We underscore the importance of the 77-year record of non-use of nuclear weapons. Russia's irresponsible nuclear rhetoric, undermining of arms control regimes, and stated intent to deploy nuclear weapons in Belarus are dangerous and unacceptable. We recall the statement in Bali of all G20 leaders, including Russia. In this context, we reiterate our position that threats by Russia of nuclear weapon use, let alone any use of nuclear weapons by Russia, in the context of its aggression against Ukraine are inadmissible. We recall the Joint Statement of the Leaders of the Five Nuclear-Weapon States issued on January 3, 2022, on Preventing Nuclear War and Avoiding Arms Races, and affirm that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought. We call on Russia to recommit—in words and deeds—to the principles enshrined in that Statement. Our security policies are based on the understanding that nuclear weapons, for as long as they exist, should serve defensive purposes, deter aggression and prevent war and coercion.
The overall decline in global nuclear arsenals achieved since the end of the Cold War must continue and not be reversed. The Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) must be upheld as the cornerstone of the global nuclear non-proliferation regime and the foundation for the pursuit of nuclear disarmament and peaceful uses of nuclear energy. We reaffirm our commitment to the ultimate goal of a world without nuclear weapons with undiminished security for all, achieved through a realistic, pragmatic and responsible approach. In this regard, Japan's ""Hiroshima Action Plan"" is a welcome contribution. We deeply regret Russia's decision to undermine the New START Treaty, and call on Russia to enable a return to full implementation of the Treaty. At the same time, China's accelerating build-up of its nuclear arsenal without transparency nor meaningful dialogue poses a concern to global and regional stability.
We emphasize the importance of transparency with regard to nuclear weapons and welcome actions already taken by the United States, France and the United Kingdom to promote effective and responsible transparency measures through providing data on their nuclear forces and the objective size of their nuclear arsenal. We call on nuclear-weapon States that have not yet done so to follow suit. To promote transparency, we also call on nuclear-weapon States that have yet to do so to engage with non-nuclear-weapon States in a meaningful dialogue on transparency regarding their nuclear arsenals and limiting nuclear competition, including through an open explanation of national reports coupled with an interactive discussion with non-nuclear-weapon States and civil society participants at future NPT related meetings. In this regard, we stress the benefit of pre-notification of relevant strategic activities, as a substantial contribution to risk reduction. The G7 recognizes the need for concrete steps by nuclear-weapon States to reduce strategic risks. We call on China and Russia to engage substantively in relevant multilateral and bilateral forums, in line with their obligations under the NPT, including Article VI.
We call for the immediate commencement of long overdue negotiations of a treaty banning the production of fissile material for use in nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices. 2023 will mark the 30th year since the consensual adoption of a United Nations (UN) General Assembly resolution calling for a Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty (FMCT), and we urge all countries to refocus political attention towards the FMCT as a priority action to forestall a recurrence of the nuclear arms race, including any and all independent or complementary efforts. In this regard, we call on all states that have not yet done so to declare and maintain voluntary moratoria on the production of fissile material for use in nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices.
We are resolute in our view that no nation should carry out any nuclear weapon test explosion or other nuclear explosion, condemn any threats to do so, and emphasize that bringing the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) into force is another urgent matter. We remain committed to upholding the global norm against nuclear explosive testing until it is legally binding and call on all states to declare new or maintain existing moratoriums on nuclear weapon test explosions or any other nuclear explosions. We express our concern over Russia's announcement of its readiness to conduct a nuclear test, and we call for Russia's adherence to its moratorium on nuclear tests. We further underscore the essential role of the CTBTO Preparatory Commission in detecting and reporting suspected nuclear explosions worldwide. The G7, collectively, has supported the CTBTO's activities in the amount of more than 100 million US dollars in 2023. We reaffirm the G7's commitment to providing sufficient resources to ensure the continued operation and the long-term sustainability of all elements of the CTBT verification system and call on others to do the same.
A world without nuclear weapons cannot be achieved without nuclear non-proliferation. We reiterate our unwavering commitment to the goal of North Korea's complete, verifiable, and irreversible abandonment of its nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programs, and any other weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and ballistic missile programs in accordance with relevant UN Security Council Resolutions (UNSCRs). We demand North Korea refrain from any other destabilizing or provocative actions, including any further nuclear tests or launches that use ballistic missile technology. North Korea cannot and will never have the status of a nuclear-weapon State under the NPT. It is critical that sanctions be fully and scrupulously implemented by all states and remain in place for as long as North Korea's WMD and ballistic missile programs exist. We remain deeply concerned about Iran's unabated escalation of its nuclear program, which has no credible civilian justification and brings it dangerously close to actual weapon-related activities. We reiterate our clear determination that Iran must never develop a nuclear weapon and we call on all countries to support the implementation of UNSCR 2231. We urge Iran to cease nuclear escalations. We call on Iran to fulfill its legal obligations and political commitments regarding nuclear non-proliferation without further delay. A diplomatic solution remains the best way to resolve international concerns regarding Iran's nuclear program. In that context, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action continues to provide a useful reference. We call on Iran to uphold its safeguards obligations and stated commitments with prompt and concrete action. We commend and continue to fully support the International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) crucial mandates and efforts in Iran.
In these times of uncertainty and tension, it is of paramount importance to preserve, resource and strengthen existing regimes and other global efforts. We urge all states to take their responsibilities seriously to meet the highest standards of safeguards, safety, and security in promoting the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, science, and technology, including those related to the deployment of next-generation nuclear technologies. We further express our profound concern over Russia's attempt to control Ukraine's nuclear facilities, which poses serious nuclear safety and security risks and is in total disregard of Ukraine's right under the NPT to pursue peaceful uses of nuclear energy. We reaffirm the importance of the implementation of the highest standards of safeguards of the IAEA and the universal adoption of the Additional Protocol (AP) as fundamental components of the nuclear non-proliferation regime. We will promote a reliable and responsible nuclear supply chain, in accordance with the highest standards of nuclear non-proliferation, including the application of the AP. We support further discussions within the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) towards the establishment of the AP as a condition of supply in the Group's guidelines. Those G7 countries which opt for nuclear power, or related peaceful nuclear applications, recognize that the use of nuclear energy, science, and technology contributes to providing affordable low-carbon energy. The G7 notes the contribution of nuclear technology applications, in such fields as medicine or isotope hydrology, to promoting prosperity and addressing the UN Sustainable Development Goals. We reiterate our utmost commitment to the G7-led Global Partnership Against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction, which for more than 20 years has delivered concrete impactful programming to advance nuclear non-proliferation in every part of the world.
We emphasize that the transparency of the management of civil plutonium must be maintained. We oppose any attempt to produce or support the production of plutonium for military programs under the guise of civilian programs, which undermines the objectives of the NPT including the promotion of peaceful uses of nuclear energy. In this regard, we underscore the importance of the implementation of the Guidelines for the Management of Plutonium (INFCIRC 549). We call on all states that committed to reporting annually their holdings of all plutonium in peaceful nuclear activities to the IAEA to fulfill those commitments. We recognize the need to manage civil stocks of highly enriched uranium with the same sense of responsibility as the plutonium covered by these guidelines. We also commit to prioritizing efforts to reduce the production and accumulation of weapons-usable nuclear material for civil purposes around the world.
Achieving the world we hope to see requires a global effort to take us from the harsh reality to the ideal, no matter how narrow the path may be. In this regard, we underscore the importance of disarmament and non-proliferation education and outreach. We encourage other leaders, youth and people from around the world to visit Hiroshima and Nagasaki to raise and sustain awareness of the realities of nuclear weapons use one can witness in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. To this end, we welcome initiatives such as the ""Youth Leader Fund for a World without Nuclear Weapons"" by Japan, the ""Young Professionals Network"" of P5, the ""Youth Champions for Disarmament"" financed by Germany, and the ""Young Women Next Generation Initiative"" established by the EU Non-Proliferation and Disarmament Consortium, as well as other initiatives that support the full, equal, and meaningful participation of women in addition to the engagement of civil society in disarmament and non-proliferation processes.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/joint-statement-group-seven-g-7-nations-leaders-hiroshima-vision-nuclear-disarmament
Joe Biden,"May 19, 2023",Joint Statement by Group of Seven (G-7) Nations Leaders on Ukraine,"1. Preamble 
At our meeting today in Hiroshima, we, the Leaders of the G7, reaffirmed our commitment to stand together against Russia's illegal, unjustifiable, and unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine. We condemn, in the strongest terms, Russia's manifest violation of the Charter of the United Nations (UN) and the impact of Russia's war on the rest of the world. 15 months of Russia's aggression has cost thousands of lives, inflicted immense suffering on the people of Ukraine, and imperiled access to food and energy for many of the world's most vulnerable people. We express our full sympathy and condolences to the Ukrainian people for their loss and suffering. We salute the Ukrainian people for their brave resistance. Our support for Ukraine will not waver. We will not tire in our commitment to mitigate the impact of Russia's illegal actions on the rest of the world.
Today we are taking new steps to ensure that Russia's illegal aggression against the sovereign state of Ukraine fails and to support the Ukrainian people in their quest for a just peace rooted in respect for international law. We are renewing our commitment to provide the financial, humanitarian, military and diplomatic support Ukraine requires for as long as it takes. We are imposing further sanctions and measures to increase the costs to Russia and those who are supporting its war effort. And we are taking steps to support partners worldwide as they navigate the suffering caused by the Russia's war, including through humanitarian assistance. We are also building on the success of our efforts to ensure that Russia is no longer able to weaponize the availability of energy against us and against the world. Since February 2022, we have adopted sanctions, import bans, and other measures to reduce our dependence on Russia's source of energy. In addition, in Elmau, we agreed to launch a price cap on Russian oil and petroleum products. This is working. Russia's revenues are down. Global oil and gas prices have fallen significantly, benefiting countries around the world.
2. Towards a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in Ukraine 
We urge Russia to stop its ongoing aggression and immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw its troops and military equipment from the entire internationally recognized territory of Ukraine. Russia started this war and can end this war. Russia's aggression against Ukraine constitutes a violation of international law, in particular the UN Charter. We reiterate our firm rejection of Russia's illegal attempts to acquire Ukrainian territory by force. We underline that a just peace cannot be realized without the complete and unconditional withdrawal of Russian troops and military equipment, and this must be included in any call for peace.
Russia's irresponsible nuclear rhetoric, undermining of arms control regimes, and stated intent to deploy nuclear weapons in Belarus are dangerous and unacceptable. We recall the statement in Bali of all G20 leaders, including Russia. In this context, we reiterate our position that threats by Russia of nuclear weapon use, let alone any use of nuclear weapons by Russia, in the context of its aggression against Ukraine are inadmissible.
We once again recall the UN General Assembly resolution A/RES/ES-11/6 titled ""Principles of the Charter of the United Nations underlying a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in Ukraine"" adopted in February this year with the broad support of the international community, and will continue to pursue concrete efforts to achieve a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in Ukraine. We remain committed to diplomacy and welcome and support the earnest efforts by Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in setting out basic principles in his Peace Formula in line with the UN Charter. With a view to a viable post-war peace settlement, we remain ready to reach arrangements together with Ukraine as well as interested countries and institutions on sustained security and other commitments to help Ukraine defend itself, secure its free and democratic future, and deter future Russian aggression. We are determined to help Ukraine build a positive future for its people. We welcome the key role that Ukraine plays in the European Political Community.
3. Nuclear safety and security 
We express our gravest concern over Russia's grossly irresponsible seizure and militarization of the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP). We support the International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) efforts to strengthen nuclear safety and security of, and the application of safeguards to, nuclear material and facilities in Ukraine, including through the continuous presence of IAEA experts and its focus on ensuring nuclear safety and security at the site. We reaffirm support for the IAEA Director General's ""Seven Indispensable Pillars of Nuclear Safety and Nuclear Security"" and highlight the importance of ensuring and promoting the safety and security of nuclear facilities under any circumstances. In this context, we highlight the G7's contribution to the IAEA's efforts in Ukraine for this purpose and call on others to provide support.
4. Support to stop Russia's war of aggression 
We commit to continuing our security assistance to Ukraine as it defends itself against Russia's aggression, tailoring our support to Ukraine's needs.
We stress the importance of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group in coordinating military and defense assistance by each country provided in line with its national circumstances.
5. Support for recovery and reconstruction of Ukraine 
We reaffirm our strong commitment to ensuring that Ukraine has the economic support it needs. Under the leadership of Japan's G7 Presidency, together with the international community, we have ensured Ukraine has the budget support it needs for 2023 and early 2024. We welcome the approval of the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and look forward to the swift implementation of Ukraine's reforms supported by the program. The program will help to stabilize Ukraine's macroeconomic and financial situation, contribute to longer-term economic sustainability, and help to catalyze further financial support from other countries and institutions as well as the private sector.
We welcome the progress made in discussions in the Multi-agency Donor Coordination Platform for Ukraine and reaffirm our intention to further coordinate with Ukraine, partner countries and relevant international organizations. We are committed to addressing Ukraine's recovery needs. We will continue our joint effort to support Ukraine's repair of its critical infrastructure, recovery and reconstruction. We are determined to use the Platform as our primary mechanism to ensure that our assistance and support for reforms are well coordinated, properly sequenced, and mutually reinforcing. It will play a central role in coordinating donor support to match Ukrainian needs, advancing Ukraine's reform agenda in line with its European path and helping to promote sustainable private sector-led growth. We also welcome the efforts of the G7+ Foreign Ministers' Meeting on Ukraine Energy Sector Support and reiterate our continued support for restoring and upgrading Ukraine's energy infrastructure. We stand ready to support the sustainable and resilient recovery and green reconstruction of Ukraine, including by sharing our experience, knowledge and expertise regarding humanitarian de-mining and war-related debris and pollution management.
We recognize the importance of the role of the private sector for Ukraine's recovery and reconstruction, including through trade and investment, which may be facilitated through insurance and other tools to manage risk. In this regard, we welcome efforts by the World Bank Group, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the European Investment Bank (EIB), and our Development Finance Institutions (DFIs) in accordance with their mandates. These efforts include the establishment of the Support for Ukraine's Reconstruction and Economy (SURE) Trust Fund at the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) as well as the launch of the Ukraine Investment Platform in Tokyo on May 12 to support Ukraine and affected countries more broadly, through further efficient co-financing and greater collaboration among the DFIs, together with the EBRD. We expect the Ukraine Recovery Conference, which will be held in London in June this year, to reinforce momentum behind Ukraine's recovery and reconstruction.
6. Anti-corruption and justice system reform 
We welcome the continued determination and efforts of the Ukrainian government and people to combat corruption, and encourage continued implementation of an effective reform agenda that will support good governance and improve investor confidence.
We support Ukraine's efforts to advance necessary institution-building as well as substantive legal reform in line with Ukraine's European path, especially in the judicial sector and promotion of the rule of law.
7. Sanctions and other measures 
We remain united in imposing coordinated sanctions and other economic actions to further undermine Russia's capacity to wage its illegal aggression. Specifically, we are taking the following measures, consistent with our respective legal authorities and processes and international law:
We will further restrict Russia's access to our economies. Building on previous measures taken to prevent Russia from accessing inputs in support of sectors key to its military industrial base, we will broaden our actions to ensure that exports of all items critical to Russia's aggression including those used by Russia on the battlefield are restricted across all our jurisdictions, including exports of industrial machinery, tools, and other technology that Russia uses to rebuild its war machine. We will further target those operating in these key sectors, such as manufacturing, construction, and transportation as well as business services. We will starve Russia of G7 technology, industrial equipment and services that support its war machine. We will continue to shield agricultural, medical, and humanitarian products from our restrictive measures and make every effort to avoid potential spillover impacts on third countries.
We will further prevent the evasion and circumvention of our measures against Russia, including targeting entities transporting material to the front. We will continue to work through the Russian Elites, Proxies, and Oligarchs (REPO) Task Force and the Enforcement Coordination Mechanism to enhance the effectiveness of our restrictive measures. We are engaging with third-countries through which restricted G7 goods, services, or technology may be provided to Russia to strengthen third-countries' understandings of G7 measures. We note and encourage commitments made by these countries to ensure our measures are not circumvented and have the intended effect.
We reiterate our call on third parties to immediately cease providing material support to Russia's aggression, or face severe costs. We will reinforce our coordination to prevent and respond to third parties supplying weapons to Russia and continue to take actions against third-country actors who materially support Russia's war.
We will also work to further curtail Russia's use of the international financial system to further its war in Ukraine. We are prepared to take further measures against those willfully supporting the financing of Russia's war. We are taking steps to further reduce avenues for Russia to circumvent our financial measures including by preventing third-country branches of Russian banks from being used to avoid sanctions. We will continue to take necessary actions against Russia's financial sector while coordinating to preserve financial channels for essential transactions.
We will continue to reduce Russia's revenue to finance its illegal aggression by taking appropriate steps to limit Russia's energy revenue and future extractive capabilities, building on the measures we have taken so far, including export bans and the price cap for seaborne Russian-origin crude oil and refined oil products. We have dramatically reduced our reliance on Russian energy and commodities. We are determined to continue on this path so that Russia is no longer able to weaponize energy against us. We will further reduce reliance on civil nuclear and related goods from Russia, including working to assist countries seeking to diversify their supplies. We will also continue efforts to reduce Russia's revenue from metals. Further, we remain committed to upholding the price caps on Russian oil and petroleum products and we will enhance our efforts to counter evasion of these caps while avoiding spillover effects and maintaining global energy supply.
In order to reduce the revenues that Russia extracts from the export of diamonds, we will continue to work closely together to restrict trade in and use of diamonds mined, processed or produced in Russia and engage with key partners with the aim of ensuring effective implementation of future coordinated restrictive measures, including through tracing technologies.
8. Responsibility for Damage 
We will continue our efforts to ensure that Russia pays for the long-term reconstruction of Ukraine. In this context, we welcome the establishment, in the framework of the Council of Europe and to meet the request from the UN General Assembly, of a Registry of Damages Caused by the Aggression of the Russian Federation Against Ukraine. In line with the commitment made through the REPO Task Force, we will continue to take measures available within our domestic frameworks to find, restrain, freeze, seize, and, where appropriate, confiscate or forfeit the assets of those individuals and entities that have been sanctioned in connection with Russia's aggression. We are taking steps to fully map holdings of Russia's sovereign assets immobilized in our jurisdictions. We reaffirm that, consistent with our respective legal systems, Russia's sovereign assets in our jurisdictions will remain immobilized until Russia pays for the damage it has caused to Ukraine.
9. Accountability 
There must be no impunity for war crimes and other atrocities, such as Russia's attacks against civilians and critical civil infrastructure. We acknowledge the efforts made at the United for Justice international conference organized by the Government of Ukraine, and recall the Bucha Declaration that calls for accountability for the most serious crimes under international law committed on the territory of Ukraine.
In this context, we reiterate our commitment to holding those responsible to account consistent with international law, including by supporting the efforts of international mechanisms, such as the International Criminal Court (ICC). We strongly condemn the unlawful deportation and transfer of Ukrainians, including children, from the occupied areas of Ukraine to Russia, and will continue to follow the progress of the ICC investigation in this regard, with the utmost attention and call for the return of these children. We also deplore instances of conflict-related sexual and gender-based violence against Ukrainians. We welcome the establishment of the International Centre for the Prosecution of the Crime of Aggression against Ukraine.
In addition, welcoming the efforts by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in this context, we underscore the importance of the protection of education of all children, in particular those impacted as well as the preservation of Ukrainian cultural properties and heritage damaged and threatened by the war of aggression. We are also paying attention to the impact of Russia's aggression on international sport. While fully respecting the autonomy of sporting organizations, we are focused on fair sporting competition as well as on ensuring that Russian and Belarusian athletes are in no way appearing as representatives of their states.
10. Support to vulnerable countries 
Parallel to our support to Ukraine, we reaffirm our commitment to address the growing needs of vulnerable countries which have been aggravated by Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine. In particular, we stress that Russia's weaponization of food has compounded economic vulnerabilities, exacerbated already dire humanitarian crises, and escalated global food insecurity and malnutrition to unprecedented levels. We welcome the significant emergency financing delivered by the IMF through the Food Shock Window approved in October 2022 and support additional efforts towards vulnerable countries. We will continue to provide rapid assistance to help affected countries and populations, including through the Global Alliance for Food Security (GAFS). We will continue to support the export of Ukrainian agri-products including through the EU-Ukraine Solidarity Lanes. In this regard, we support the expansion and extension of the Black Sea Grain Initiative (BSGI) and we call upon Russia to stop threatening global food supplies and allow the BSGI to operate at its maximum potential. We remain committed to the Grain from Ukraine initiative. Our contributions support the delivery of humanitarian food assistance to the most vulnerable countries in partnership with the UN World Food Programme (WFP). We remain dedicated to concrete collaborative actions in order to enhance energy security and achieve climate commitments. We will continue to work together in solidarity to limit the impacts from the global energy crisis triggered by Russia's aggression against Ukraine to support vulnerable and affected countries, such as through the International Energy Agency Task Force on Natural Gas and Clean Fuels Market Monitoring and Supply Security.
11. Conclusion 
We hereby pledge, from Hiroshima, the ""symbol of peace"", that G7 members will mobilize all our policy instruments and, together with Ukraine, make every effort to bring a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in Ukraine as soon as possible.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/joint-statement-group-seven-g-7-nations-leaders-ukraine-0
Joe Biden,"May 20, 2023","Joint Statement by President Biden, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of Australia, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, and Prime Minister Fumio Kishida of Japan on the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue Leaders Summit in Hiroshima, Japan","20 May 2023, Hiroshima
Today, we—Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of Australia, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, Prime Minister Kishida Fumio of Japan, and President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. of the United States—met for the third in-person Quad Leaders' Summit, hosted by Prime Minister Albanese.
Together, we reaffirm our steadfast commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific that is inclusive and resilient. The global strategic and economic environment is changing rapidly—with direct impacts on countries in the region. We believe we should navigate this time of uncertainty and opportunity together, working closely with our Indo-Pacific partners. We believe all countries have a role in contributing to regional peace, stability, and prosperity, as well as upholding international law, including the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity, and the rules-based international order. We seek a region where no country dominates and no country is dominated—one where all countries are free from coercion, and can exercise their agency to determine their futures. Our four countries are united by this shared vision.
As Indo-Pacific countries, Quad partners are deeply invested in our region's success. Harnessing our collective strengths and resources, we are supporting the region's development, stability, and prosperity through the Quad's positive, practical agenda. Our work is guided by regional countries' priorities and responds to the region's needs. We are and will continue to be transparent in what we do. Respect for the leadership of regional institutions, including the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF), and the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA), is and will remain at the centre of the Quad's efforts.
The Quad Leaders' Vision Statement we have issued today sets out our shared vision for the Quad and the Indo-Pacific region based on these principles.
Today we reaffirm our consistent and unwavering support for ASEAN centrality and unity. We are committed to ensuring the Quad's work is aligned with ASEAN's principles and priorities and continues to support implementation of the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific (AOIP). We underscore ASEAN's regional leadership role, including in the East Asia Summit, the region's premier leader-led forum for strategic dialogue, and the ASEAN Regional Forum. We strongly support Indonesia's 2023 ASEAN Chairmanship and its Chair theme ""ASEAN Matters: Epicentrum of Growth"". We will continue to strengthen our respective relationships with ASEAN and seek opportunities for greater Quad collaboration in support of the AOIP.
We recommit to working in partnership with Pacific island countries to achieve shared aspirations and address shared challenges. We reaffirm our support for Pacific regional institutions that have served the region well over many years, foremost the PIF, and warmly welcome Cook Islands assuming the PIF Chair in 2023. We continue to support the objectives of the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent, and commit to working with partners, including through Partners in the Blue Pacific, to support engagement with these objectives. We welcome the 3rd Summit of the Forum for India-Pacific Islands Cooperation and the U.S.—Pacific Island Forum meeting, both to be held in Papua New Guinea in coming days. We also applaud Japan's longstanding engagement with Pacific island countries through the Pacific Islands' Leaders Meeting (PALM), and Australia's deep and enduring commitment to the Pacific as part of the Pacific family, including as a founding member of the PIF.
In these efforts, Quad Leaders will listen to and be guided at every step by Pacific priorities, including climate action, ocean health, resilient infrastructure, maritime security and financial integrity. In particular, we acknowledge climate change remains the single greatest threat to the livelihoods, security and wellbeing of the peoples of the Pacific and applaud Pacific island countries' global leadership on climate action.
We remain committed to strengthening cooperation in the Indian Ocean region. We welcome the work of IORA as the Indian Ocean region's premier forum for addressing the region's challenges. We recognise India's leadership in finalising the IORA Outlook on the Indo-Pacific (IOIP) and express our support for its implementation. We thank Bangladesh for its term as IORA Chair and commit to working with Sri Lanka and India as they assume the roles of IORA Chair and Vice Chair respectively this year.
We, the countries of the Quad, will work together to be a global force for good. We will bring our combined resolve to support each other's international leadership in 2023 including Australia's hosting of the Quad, Japan's G7 presidency, India's G20 presidency and the United States' APEC host year.
The Quad's positive, practical agenda 
We recognise the urgent need to address the climate crisis, which poses tremendous environmental, social, and economic challenges for our region. Today we underline our dedication to taking significant action on climate change—individually and collectively. We will continue to support climate mitigation, adaptation, and resilience efforts in alignment with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement as well as regional architecture, including ASEAN, the PIF, and IORA. We will continue to collaborate on green shipping and ports, disaster risk management, exchanging climate information, and capacity building support for Article 6 implementation of the Paris Agreement. Under the Climate Information Services Initiative, we plan to coordinate our collective resources to support early warning systems in the Indo-Pacific, including through the Pacific-led Weather Ready Pacific initiative and the longstanding leadership of the Pacific Meteorological Council. We also intend to provide support through global partnerships such as the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI) and its Infrastructure for Resilient Islands States (IRIS) initiative.
We recognise that achieving sustainable consumption and production is a key component of global efforts to achieve the 2030 Agenda and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), environment and climate ambitions. We will work together to seek meaningful outcomes on climate action and the clean economy transition in the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF).
The latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report makes clear that rapid and far-reaching transitions are needed across all sectors and systems. As we move to a net zero world, we underscore that it is critical to strengthen our cooperation to ensure better access to affordable, reliable and secure clean energy in the Indo-Pacific. We will work together to increase the region's access to climate finance and climate smart technology. Under the Quad Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation Package (Q-CHAMP), launched in 2022, we continue to work together and with Indo-Pacific partners to enhance climate and clean energy cooperation as well as promote adaptation and resilience. In this regard, we welcome the Sydney Energy Forum and the Quad Clean Hydrogen Partnership meeting hosted by Australia and India respectively in July 2022.
Building on those foundations, today, we are issuing a Statement of Principles on Clean Energy Supply Chains in the Indo-Pacific, which provide a basis for our engagement in the region on clean energy supply chain development. The principles are designed to promote diverse, secure, transparent and resilient clean energy supply chains and support a sustainable, and inclusive clean energy transition. We also announce a Clean Energy Supply Chains initiative designed to accelerate the Indo-Pacific's clean energy transition. Working with Indo-Pacific partners, the initiative will facilitate research and development and feasibility study projects to lower clean energy manufacturing and deployment costs, enhance regional energy security, and expand and diversify the regional production of necessary materials and technologies.
The COVID-19 pandemic has shown us how important health security is to our societies, our economies, and the stability of our region. In 2021 and 2022, Quad partners stepped up to help meet the region's most pressing need, delivering more than 400 million safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine doses to Indo-Pacific countries and almost 800 million doses globally, bilaterally and in partnership with COVAX.
Today, we announce the evolution of our Quad Vaccine Partnership into a broader Quad Health Security Partnership. Through this partnership, we will strengthen our coordination and collaboration in support of health security in the Indo-Pacific. We plan to implement a suite of activities to build the region's capacity to detect and respond rapidly to outbreaks of diseases with epidemic and pandemic potential. These activities include support for health workforce development, disease surveillance, and electronic health information systems and coordination of outbreak responses, such as the Quad Pandemic Preparedness Exercise.
We will continue cooperation with Indo-Pacific partners to meet the region's infrastructure priorities. Delivering on our commitment at the 2022 Quad Leaders' Summit, we will continue to support access to quality, sustainable and climate-resilient infrastructure investments in our region. We aim to ensure the investments we support are fit for purpose, demand driven and responsive to countries' needs, and do not impose unsustainable debt burdens. We will build on ongoing programs for Indo-Pacific countries including training and capacity-building focused on digital and economic connectivity, clean energy, and climate resilient power sector infrastructure. We continue to strengthen capacity to manage debt issues, including under the G20 Common Framework and promote debt sustainability and transparency.
Today, we announce a new initiative to boost infrastructure expertise across the Indo-Pacific: the 'Quad Infrastructure Fellowships Program'. The initiative aims to empower more than 1,800 of the region's infrastructure practitioners to design, build and manage quality infrastructure in their home countries.
The Quad is committed to improving the region's connectivity through the development of resilient infrastructure. We recognise the urgent need to support quality undersea cable networks in the Indo-Pacific, which are key to global growth and prosperity. Today we announce a new 'Quad Partnership for Cable Connectivity and Resilience'. The Partnership will strengthen cable systems in the Indo-Pacific, drawing on Quad countries' world-class expertise in manufacturing, delivering and maintaining cable infrastructure.
Quad partners' export credit agencies make an important contribution to the prosperity of the Indo-Pacific. We welcome ongoing efforts to enhance cooperation among Quad partners' export credit agencies: including through a Memorandum of Cooperation between ECGC Limited of India, Export Finance Australia (EFA), Nippon Export and Investment Insurance (NEXI) of Japan, and Export-Import Bank of the United States (USEXIM).
We recognise the transformative power of technology, including digital public infrastructure, to support sustainable development in the Indo-Pacific and deliver economic and social benefits. We are stepping up our efforts to strengthen supply chain resilience and improve the region's digital connectivity through access to critical and emerging technologies and advanced telecommunications technology, including 5G networks.
Today, we announce cooperation with Palau to establish a deployment of Open Radio Access Networks (Open RAN), the first in the Pacific. The Quad is committed to ensuring regional countries are not left behind as telecommunications markets and network architectures evolve. We support access to innovations, such as Open RAN, that enable greater vendor choice for countries to expand and modernise their telecommunications networks. We also welcome the release of the Open RAN Security Report which is expected to promote industry investment in approaches to telecommunications that are demonstrably open, interoperable, trusted and secure.
The Quad International Standards Cooperation Network and the Quad Principles on Critical and Emerging Technology Standards, released today, reflect our support for industry-led, consensus-based multi-stakeholder approaches to the development of technology standards.
We welcome the launch of the private sector-led Quad Investors Network (QUIN), which aims to facilitate investments in strategic technologies, including clean energy, semiconductors, critical minerals, and quantum.
We intend to support joint research to advance innovation in agriculture through emerging technologies designed to empower farmers everywhere to increase yield and resistance.
We reaffirm our commitment to a more secure cyberspace and to fostering an international digital economy that works for everyone. Quad partners will continue collaborating to enhance regional capacity and resilience to cyber incidents and threats. We welcome the first Quad Cyber Challenge, held earlier this year to promote cyber awareness and empower participants across the Indo-Pacific to protect themselves online. We also welcome the Quad Joint Principles for Secure Software and the Quad Joint Principles for Cyber Security of Critical Infrastructure, and efforts to develop a guiding framework for ensuring supply chain security and resilience. These principles are designed to strengthen our region's defences against cyber threats to the software supply chain and critical infrastructure and services.
We recognise the importance of space technologies and space-related applications in responding to climate change and disasters, and enhancing the sustainable use of oceans and marine resources. We reaffirm our commitment to supporting capacity building for countries in the region. The Quad Space Working Group will explore avenues to deliver Earth Observation data and other space-related applications to assist nations across the Indo-Pacific to strengthen climate early warning systems and better manage the impacts of extreme weather events. We commit to open sharing of civil Earth Observation data. We will continue to consult each other and the region on the peaceful, safe and sustainable use of outer space. We announce our intention to share expertise and experience in space situational awareness. We commit to strengthening our commercial space cooperation, including convening a commercial space business forum in 2023.
We are pleased the Indo-Pacific Partnership for Maritime Domain Awareness (IPMDA), announced at the 2022 Tokyo Quad Leaders' Summit, is underway in its pilot phase. Through IPMDA, we are providing near-real-time, integrated and cost-effective maritime domain data to maritime agencies in Southeast Asia and the Pacific, and will expand coverage to partners in the Indian Ocean region in the coming months. This supports our regional partners in combatting a wide range of illicit maritime activities, including illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, and responding to climate-related and humanitarian events. We are committed to deepening engagement with regional partners to support maritime safety and security and uphold international law.
At the 2021 Quad Leaders' Summit in Washington, we launched the Quad Fellowship. This year, we welcome the first cohort of Quad STEM Fellows, who will begin their studies in the United States in August 2023. Our one hundred Quad Fellows from all four Quad countries represent the best and brightest of our next generation. The diversity and dynamism of this inaugural class will help to ensure our nations remain at the forefront of innovation and we wish them well.
Global and regional issues 
We remain fully resolved to uphold peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific maritime domain. We strongly oppose destabilising or unilateral actions that seek to change the status quo by force or coercion. We emphasise the importance of adherence to international law, particularly as reflected in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), and the maintenance of freedom of navigation and overflight, in addressing challenges to the maritime rules-based order, including those in the East and South China Seas. We express serious concern at the militarisation of disputed features, the dangerous use of coastguard and maritime militia vessels, and efforts to disrupt other countries' offshore resource exploitation activities. We emphasise that disputes should be resolved peacefully and in accordance with international law, without threat or use of force.
Together, with our global and regional partners, we will buttress international institutions and initiatives that underpin global peace, prosperity and development. We reiterate our unwavering support for the United Nations (UN) Charter and the three pillars of the UN system. In consultation with our partners, we will work collectively to address attempts to unilaterally undermine the integrity of the UN, its Charter and its agencies. We seek to strengthen and reform the multilateral system so it may better reflect contemporary realities and meet aspirations of the Indo-Pacific region. We remain committed to a comprehensive UN reform agenda, including through expansion in permanent and non-permanent categories of membership of the UN Security Council. We reaffirm our commitment to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the achievement of its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We underscore the importance of achieving the SDGs in a comprehensive manner without selectively prioritising a narrow set of such goals, and reaffirm that the UN has a central role in supporting countries in their implementation.
We stand for adherence to international law, peaceful resolution of disputes and respect for principles of the UN Charter, including territorial integrity and sovereignty of all states. In this context, today we express our deep concern over the war raging in Ukraine and mourn its terrible and tragic humanitarian consequences. We recognise its serious impacts on the global economic system including on food, fuel and energy security and critical supply chains. We will continue to render humanitarian assistance to Ukraine for its recovery. Conscious that ours must not be an era of war, we remain committed to dialogue and diplomacy. We support a comprehensive, just and lasting peace consistent with the UN Charter. In this context, we concur that the use, or threat of use, of nuclear weapons is serious and inadmissible.
We condemn North Korea's destabilising ballistic missile launches and pursuit of nuclear weapons in violation of multiple UN Security Council resolutions (UNSCRs). These launches pose a grave threat to international peace and stability. We urge North Korea to abide by all its obligations under the UNSCRs, refrain from further provocations and engage in substantive dialogue. We urge North Korea to resolve the abductions issue immediately. We reaffirm our commitment to the complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula consistent with relevant UNSCRs and call on all countries to fully implement these UNSCRs. We stress the importance of addressing proliferation of nuclear and missile technologies related to North Korea in the region and beyond.
We remain deeply concerned by the deteriorating situation in Myanmar and again call for an immediate cessation of violence. We call for the release of all those arbitrarily detained, unhindered humanitarian access, resolution of the crisis through constructive dialogue, and the transition of Myanmar towards an inclusive democracy. We reaffirm our consistent support to ASEAN-led efforts, including the work of the ASEAN Chair and Office of the Special Envoy. We call for full implementation of all commitments under the ASEAN Five-Point Consensus.
We unequivocally condemn terrorism and violent extremism in all its forms and manifestations including cross-border terrorism. We are committed to international cooperation and will work with our regional partners in a comprehensive and sustained manner to strengthen capability to prevent, detect and respond to threats posed by terrorism and violent extremism, consistent with international law. We are committed to working together to promote accountability for the perpetrators of such terrorist attacks. We reiterate our condemnation of terrorist attacks, including the 26/11 attacks in Mumbai and in Pathankot, and our commitment to pursuing designations, as appropriate, by the UN Security Council 1267 Sanctions Committee. We will strengthen our cooperation through the new Working Group on Counterterrorism announced during the Quad Foreign Ministers' Meeting in March 2023.
We endorse the outcomes of the 3 March Quad Foreign Ministers' Meeting in New Delhi and the Ministers' Joint Statement committing to deepening practical and positive cooperation for the benefit of the Indo-Pacific region. India will host our next in-person Quad Leaders' Summit in 2024.
We, the Quad Leaders, remain firm in our resolve to meet the challenges facing our region and clear in our vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific that is stable, prosperous and inclusive. In doing so we are committed to working in partnership with Indo-Pacific countries—large and small—in deciding our future and shaping the region we all want to live in.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/joint-statement-president-biden-prime-minister-anthony-albanese-australia-prime-minister-0
Joe Biden,"May 20, 2023",Joint Statement—Group of Seven (G-7) Nations Hiroshima Leaders' Communiqué,"Preamble 
1. We, the Leaders of the Group of Seven (G7), met in Hiroshima for our annual Summit on May 19-21, 2023, more united than ever in our determination to meet the global challenges of this moment and set the course for a better future.

3. We will work with our international partners to achieve a world that is human-centered, inclusive and resilient, leaving no one behind. In that spirit, we welcomed the participation of the Leaders of Australia, Brazil, Comoros, Cook Islands, India, Indonesia, Republic of Korea, and Vietnam.
Ukraine 
4. We once again condemn in the strongest possible terms the war of aggression by Russia against Ukraine, which constitutes a serious violation of international law, including the UN Charter. Russia's brutal war of aggression represents a threat to the whole world in breach of fundamental norms, rules and principles of the international community. We reaffirm our unwavering support for Ukraine for as long as it takes to bring a comprehensive, just and lasting peace. We issued the G7 Leaders' Statement on Ukraine, and with the clear intention and concrete actions set forth in it, we commit to intensifying our diplomatic, financial, humanitarian and military support for Ukraine, to increasing the costs to Russia and those supporting its war efforts, and to continuing to counter the negative impacts of the war on the rest of the world, particularly on the most vulnerable people.
Disarmament and Non-proliferation 
5. Together with the G7 Leaders' Hiroshima Vision on Nuclear Disarmament, we express our commitment to achieving a world without nuclear weapons with undiminished security for all, through taking a realistic, pragmatic, and responsible approach. We reaffirm the importance of disarmament and non-proliferation efforts to create a more stable and safer world. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) is the cornerstone of the global nuclear non-proliferation regime and the foundation for the pursuit of nuclear disarmament and peaceful uses of nuclear energy. We remain committed to the universalization, effective implementation, and strengthening of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention, as well as the Chemical Weapons Convention. We welcome the steps taken to strengthen effective and responsible export controls on materials, technology, and research that could be used for military purposes in a way that keeps pace with rapid technological developments and recognize the central role of multilateral export control regimes in this regard.
Indo-Pacific 
6. We reiterate the importance of a free and open Indo-Pacific, which is inclusive, prosperous, secure, based on the rule of law, and that protects shared principles including sovereignty, territorial integrity, peaceful resolution of disputes, and fundamental freedoms and human rights. Given the importance of the region, G7 members and our partners have taken respective Indo-Pacific initiatives to help strengthen our engagement. We underscore our commitment to strengthen coordination with regional partners, including the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and its member states. We reaffirm our unwavering support for ASEAN centrality and unity and our commitment to promoting cooperation in line with the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific. We also reaffirm our partnership with Pacific Island countries and reiterate the importance of supporting their priorities and needs in accordance with the Pacific Islands Forum's 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent. We welcome and further encourage efforts made by the private sector, universities and think tanks, which contribute to realizing a free and open Indo-Pacific.
Global Economy, Finance and Sustainable Development 
7. The global economy has shown resilience against multiple shocks including the COVID-19 pandemic, Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine, and associated inflationary pressures. Nevertheless, we need to remain vigilant and stay agile and flexible in our macroeconomic policy amid heightened uncertainty about the global economic outlook. In striving for strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth, we are committed to a stability- and growth-oriented macroeconomic policy mix that supports medium-term fiscal sustainability and price stability. Inflation remains elevated and central banks remain strongly committed to achieving price stability, in line with their respective mandates. Meanwhile, fiscal policy should continue to provide, as appropriate, temporary and targeted support to vulnerable groups suffering from the increase in cost of living and catalyze investment needed for the green and digital transformations while the overall fiscal stance should ensure medium-term sustainability. We also reaffirm our existing G7 exchange rate commitments. We reemphasize the importance of supply-side reforms, especially those that increase labor supply and enhance productivity. We also stress the crucial role of women and under-represented groups for the long-term success of our economies through promoting inclusion, diversity and innovation. We look forward to a successful review of the G20/Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Principles of Corporate Governance to strengthen sustainability and resilience of the private sector. Recognizing that our economic and social structures have undergone dynamic and fundamental transformation, we underscore the multidimensional aspects of welfare and that these aspects should be brought into policymaking in a practical and effective manner. Such efforts will help preserve confidence in democracy and a market-based economy, which are the core values of the G7.
8. We will continue to closely monitor financial sector developments and stand ready to take appropriate actions to maintain financial stability and the resilience of the global financial system. We reaffirm that our financial system is resilient, supported by the financial regulatory reforms implemented after the 2008 global financial crisis. We strongly support the work of the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and standard-setting bodies on enhancing the resilience of non-bank financial intermediation. We will continue policy deliberation on digital money to harness the benefits of innovation such as payment efficiency as well as financial inclusion while addressing potential risks to the stability, resilience and integrity of the monetary and financial system. Effective monitoring, regulation and oversight are critical to addressing financial stability and integrity risks posed by crypto-asset activities and markets and to avoid regulatory arbitrage, while supporting responsible innovation.
9. We re-emphasize our strong political commitment towards the swift global implementation of the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework Two-Pillar Solution to address the tax challenges arising from globalization and the digitalization of the economy and to establish a more stable and fairer international tax system. We recognize significant progress in the negotiation of the Pillar 1 Multilateral Convention (MLC) and reaffirm our commitment to the swift completion of the negotiation so that the MLC can be ready for signature within the agreed timeline. We welcome the progresses in domestic legislation toward the implementation of Pillar 2. We will further provide developing countries with support for strengthening their tax capacity to build sustainable tax revenue sources, highlighting the importance of assistance for the implementation of the Two-Pillar Solution.
10. We recognize that achieving the sustainable development goals by 2030, reducing poverty, responding to global challenges including the climate crisis, and addressing debt vulnerabilities in low and middle-income countries are urgent, interrelated and mutually reinforcing. We are determined to do our part to mobilize the private and public resources needed to meet these challenges and support a just transition. Recognizing the importance of providing and protecting global public goods, we will support efforts to embed building resilience, sustainability and inclusiveness as integral elements in MDBs' efforts to reduce poverty and promote shared prosperity. We will strive to enhance the development finance toolkit to mobilize additional financing from international financial institutions, bilateral partners, and the private sector to more effectively reduce poverty by better addressing vulnerabilities including climate change. We will work together and with partners to deliver this ambition and make concrete progress on this agenda at key moments over the coming year starting with the Summit organized in Paris on June 22-23 to revitalize global development financing, and continuing the momentum through the G20 Summit in New Delhi, the SDG Summit in New York, the 2023 World Bank Group (WBG) and International Monetary Fund (IMF) Annual Meetings in Marrakech, the G20 Compact with Africa Conference in Berlin, and the 28th meeting of the Conference of the Parties of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC-COP 28) in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
11. We are determined to take on a leading role in reversing the setback of progress towards the SDGs. Recognizing that 2023 is the halfway point to achieve the SDGs, we highlight the importance of the SDG Summit in September and will ambitiously contribute to a successful outcome. We reaffirm our commitment to revitalizing international cooperation and strengthen multilateralism. We will accelerate the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA), and will do so in a comprehensive and gender-transformative manner including through locally-led development. We will also promote the concept of human security in the new era aiming to realize a society that leaves no one behind. We stress the critical role of development cooperation and international partnerships in addressing global challenges and the need to engage with international partners in solidarity. We also call for further domestic resource mobilization and efficient use of existing resources as well as mobilizing private financial assets to address financing gaps for sustainable development. We underscore the need for continued efforts to scale up official development assistance (ODA) and expand its catalytic use including through innovative financing mechanisms, recognizing the importance of respective commitments, such as the 0.7% ODA/GNI target that some countries adopted.
12. We remain concerned that serious challenges to debt sustainability are undermining the progress towards the SDGs and low- and middle-income countries are disproportionately affected by Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine and wider global challenges. We reiterate the urgency of addressing debt vulnerabilities in these countries and fully support the G20's effort to improve the implementation of the Common Framework for Debt Treatments beyond the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) in a predictable, timely, orderly and coordinated manner, providing clarity to participants. We welcome the recent approval by the IMF board of a program for Ghana. Beyond the Common Framework, debt vulnerabilities in middle income countries (MICs) should be addressed by multilateral coordination. In this respect, we welcome the launch of the creditors' meeting for Sri Lanka under the three co-chairs, France, India, and Japan, and look forward to a swift resolution as a successful model for future multilateral efforts to address MICs' debt issues. We also stress the importance of private creditors providing debt treatments on terms at least as favorable to ensure fair burden sharing in line with the comparability of treatment principle. We welcome the development of Climate Resilient Debt Clauses (CRDC) to enhance the safety net for borrowers facing the impacts of climate change. We welcome work by our finance ministers on this topic and encourage more creditors to offer CRDC for loan agreements. In order to enhance debt data accuracy and transparency, we invite all official bilateral creditors to join the data sharing exercise for debt data reconciliation, including through further advancing the G20's initiative in the area of debt data accuracy.
13. We encourage MDBs and Development Financial Institutions (DFIs) to accelerate their efforts to increase their capacity to leverage private finance, including through implementing MDB reforms. In this regard, we strongly support and encourage to expedite the ongoing work on the evolution of the MDBs to review and transform their business models to better address transboundary challenges such as climate change, pandemics, fragility and conflict, which are integral to achieving poverty reduction and shared prosperity. This evolution should come with the most efficient use of their existing capital. To this end, we will contribute to developing an ambitious G20 Roadmap on implementing the recommendations of the G20 MDB Capital Adequacy Framework Review and call on MDBs to make further progress in a comprehensive manner while safeguarding MDBs' long-term financial sustainability, robust credit ratings and preferred creditor status. Building on key reforms to the WBG's mission and operational model along with financial reforms that can add up to $50 billion of financing capacity over the coming decade, we look forward to further progress at the WBG toward the 2023 WBG and IMF Annual Meetings and beyond so that ambitious reforms can be made on a continual basis. We encourage other MDBs to join this initiative for a coordinated approach of MDBs as a system. We also call on MDBs to make the best use of policy and knowledge support, and explore strengthened approaches to promote mobilizing domestic resources and private capital as well as private sector engagement. We have further advanced our joint efforts to support countries most in need through the voluntary channeling of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) or equivalent contributions. We welcome that additional pledges by Japan and France, amongst others, together with our previous contributions and commitments, put the global ambition of $100 billion within reach and call for the delivery of existing pledges and for further pledges from all willing and able countries to fulfill the ambition. We support the IMF achieving its agreed 2021 fundraising targets by the 2023 WBG and IMF Annual Meetings and identifying all available options to put the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT) which supports Low Income Countries (LICs), on a sustainable footing with a view to meeting the growing needs of LICs in the coming years. We will further explore viable options for enabling the voluntary channeling of SDRs through MDBs, while respecting national legal frameworks and the need to preserve the reserve assets character and status of SDRs.
14. We stress the importance of narrowing the infrastructure investment gap in low and middle income partner countries, including by delivering financing for quality infrastructure, supporting efforts to advance policy reforms needed to attract investment, operationalizing country-led partnerships, and promoting upstream support including project preparation support. We reaffirm our shared commitment to the G7 Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) and to working together and aiming to mobilize up to $600 billion by 2027.We will continue strengthening global partnerships for public and private investments in sustainable, inclusive, resilient and quality infrastructure with partner countries. We will mobilize the private sector for accelerated action to this end. Our offer is fair and transparent and aims at accelerating global sustainable development with the focus on delivering impact at local level. We welcome the Factsheet on PGII that demonstrates how the G7 and partners have made concrete progress in fostering investments that will create lasting positive impacts and promote sustainable development. We reiterate our support to the G20 Compact with Africa as a key framework to enhance the business environment in Africa and call on reform-oriented partners to join and strengthen this initiative.
15. We shared our determination to promote transparent and fair development finance and work together to address the gap in implementing existing principles such as debt transparency and sustainability, fair appraisal, selection, and lending practices for quality infrastructure investment. In this regard, we call on all actors to adhere to international rules, standards and principles, including the G20 Principles for Quality Infrastructure Investment, the G20 Operational Guidelines for Sustainable Financing, the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. These rules, standards and principles also include measures to safeguard the integrity of infrastructure investments.
16. We note the importance of addressing development, humanitarian, peace and security issues together. We are determined to address the unprecedented number of humanitarian crises, focusing on women and girls and those in vulnerable situations. In this regard, we commit to providing over $21 billion in total to address the worsening humanitarian crises this year, including in response to urgent food crises. Bearing in mind that many countries are vulnerable to disasters, including Small Island Developing States, we will accelerate international disaster risk reduction cooperation in line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 and the output of its midterm review conducted by the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR). We emphasize the importance of a disaster preparedness approach and investment in human capital, goods and infrastructure that contribute not only to ""risk transfer"" but also to ""risk reduction,"" resulting in the strengthening of anticipatory actions. We remain committed to holding ourselves accountable, in an open and transparent way, for the promises we have made. In this regard, we endorse the 2023 Hiroshima Progress Report, following up on the G7's development-related commitments on food security and nutrition as well as refugees and migration.
17. We emphasize the transformative power of cities worldwide as drivers for every aspect of sustainable development. We will continue our cooperation on sustainable urban development and task our relevant Ministers to consider the development of principles on carbon neutral, resilient and inclusive cities and on the digitalization in cities, and to accelerate the use of data and technologies for cities. This work will support exchanges with our global partners, whose cities face some of the most significant challenges relating to climate change.
Climate Change 
18. Our planet is facing unprecedented challenges from the triple global crisis of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution as well as from the ongoing global energy crisis. We are steadfast in our commitment to the Paris agreement, keeping a limit of 1.5 °C global temperature rise within reach through scaled up action in this critical decade, halting and reversing biodiversity loss by 2030, and ensuring energy security, whilst leveraging synergies and recognizing the interdependent nature of these challenges. While Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine impacts energy markets and supply chains globally, our goal to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050 at the latest remains unchanged. We emphasize our strong concern, amplified by the latest finding of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and its Sixth Assessment Report (AR6), at the accelerating and intensifying impacts of climate change, and highlight the increased urgency to reduce global GHG emissions by around 43 percent by 2030 and 60 percent by 2035, relative to the 2019 level, in light of its latest findings. We reiterate our commitment made in Elmau last year to rapidly implement domestic mitigation measures aimed at achieving our Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) targets and to increase our ambition including, for example, by adopting or strengthening sectoral targets, by developing non-CO2 sub targets, and by adopting stringent implementation measures. Mindful of our leadership role, and noting that emissions have already peaked in all G7 countries, we recognize the critical role of all major economies in limiting increases in global temperature over this critical decade and in subsequent decades. In this context, we underscore that every major economy should have significantly enhanced the ambition of its NDC since the Paris Agreement; already peaked its GHG emissions or indicated that it will do so no later than 2025; and in particular, included economy-wide absolute reduction targets and that cover all GHGs in its NDC. Accordingly, we call on all Parties—especially major economies—whose 2030 NDC targets or long-term low GHG emission development Strategies (LTSs) are not yet aligned with a 1.5 °C pathway and net zero by 2050 at the latest, to revisit and strengthen the 2030 NDC targets and publish or update their LTSs as soon as possible and well before UNFCCC-COP28, and to commit to net zero by 2050 at the latest. Furthermore, we call on all Parties to commit at UNFCCC-COP28 to peak global GHG emissions immediately and by no later than 2025. We reaffirm our commitment to the Global Methane Pledge and we will step up efforts to collectively reduce global anthropogenic methane emissions by at least 30 percent below 2020 levels by 2030. We commit to actively contributing to securing the most ambitious outcomes of the first global stocktake (GST) at UNFCCC-COP28, which should result in enhanced, immediate and ambitious actions across mitigation, adaptation, means of implementation and support. We call on all Parties to submit their next round of NDCs and LTSs well ahead of UNFCCC-COP30 that are informed by the outcomes of the GST, reflecting economy-wide absolute reduction targets including all GHGs, sectors and categories. These should reflect significantly enhanced ambition aligned with a 1.5 °C pathway and should also include their revisited and strengthened 2030 targets.
19. Noting the importance of increasing the pace and scale of action on climate change, biodiversity loss and clean energy transitions, we will globally advance and promote a green transformation, working together to realize transformation of our economies to reach net-zero GHG emissions by 2050 at the latest. We will engage with developing and emerging countries to accelerate emission reduction, including by supporting their transitions to climate resilient, circular, and nature positive economies and net-zero GHG emissions through various and practical pathways taking into account national circumstances. To that end, we reaffirm our strong commitment to supporting developing countries' just energy transitions, which will be supported by coordinated actions, including through the PGII. We welcome progress achieved on JETPs with South Africa, Indonesia and Vietnam, and also continue our discussions with India and Senegal. We take note of initiatives that are intended to support clean energy transition in countries around the world, such as Asia Zero Emission Community (AZEC) initiative, the Powering Past Coal Alliance (PPCA), 2050 Pathways Platform, Net Zero World (NZW), and the Global Carbon Pricing Challenge and underscore the importance of actions taken through such initiatives being aligned with a 1.5 °C pathway. We will take further action on supply-side measures and recognize the need for further decarbonization efforts on the demand-side such as promoting changes in infrastructure and material use and end-use technology adoption as well as promoting sustainable consumer choice. We also recognize the vital role of sub-national governments in collaboration with other stakeholders and partners to advance climate and energy actions based on local needs and environmental conditions. We reaffirm the important role of high integrity carbon markets and carbon pricing to foster cost-efficient reductions in emission levels, drive innovation and enable a transformation to net zero, through the optimal use of a range of policy levers to price carbon. We support appropriate policy mixes including carbon pricing, non-pricing mechanisms, and incentives that effectively reduce emissions, and note that these could vary reflecting country-specific circumstances. We strongly support the OECD Inclusive Forum on Carbon Mitigation Approaches (IFCMA). We look forward to advancing the open, cooperative, and inclusive Climate Club, in collaboration with international partners, to advance industrial decarbonization. We encourage private entities to commit to GHG net-zero emissions throughout the value chain via credible net zero pledges and transparent implementation strategies. We also encourage and promote private entities' work to foster innovation contributing to the emission reduction of other entities through decarbonization solutions. We welcome the progress of the Industrial Decarbonization Agenda (IDA) that decided to start working on implementation of the new Global Data Collection Framework for steel production and product emissions. We reaffirm our commitment to a highly decarbonized road sector by 2030, and recognize the importance of reducing GHG emissions from the global fleet and the range of pathways to approach this goal in line with trajectories required for keeping a limit of 1.5 °C within reach. We are committed to the goal of achieving net-zero emissions in the road sector by 2050. In this context, we highlight the various actions that each of us is taking to decarbonize our vehicle fleet, including such domestic policies that are designed to achieve 100 percent or the overwhelming penetration of sales of light duty vehicles (LDVs) as zero emission vehicles (ZEV) by 2035 and beyond; to achieve 100 percent electrified vehicles in new passenger car sales by 2035; to promote associated infrastructure and sustainable carbon-neutral fuels including sustainable bio- and synthetic fuels. We note the opportunities that these policies offer to contribute to a highly decarbonized road sector, including progressing towards a share of over 50 percent of zero emission LDVs sold globally by 2030. Considering the findings of the International Energy Agency (IEA)'s Energy Technology Perspective 2023, we also note the opportunity to collectively reduce by at least 50 percent CO2 emissions from G7 vehicle stock by 2035 or earlier relative to the level in 2000 as a halfway point to achieving net zero and to track the progress on a yearly basis. We reaffirm our commitment to strengthen global efforts to achieve GHG lifecycle zero emissions from international shipping by 2050 at the latest. We commit to support this target and introducing intermediate targets for 2030 and 2040 for the revised International Maritime Organization (IMO) GHG reduction strategy, in line with efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels through a credible basket of measures. We commit to accelerate global efforts to achieve the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)'s goal of net-zero emissions in international aviation by 2050, including making an effort for promoting and introducing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), introducing new technologies and improving operations, also building on ICAO's Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA).
20. In the face of the increasing threats posed by climate change, supporting climate-vulnerable groups is essential for ensuring human security and achieving resilient and sustainable development. We will continue to scale up and enhance support to strengthen the resilience of climate-vulnerable groups through enhancing climate change adaptation and climate disaster risk reduction, response and recovery and early-warning systems including through the Global Shield against Climate Risks and other initiatives related to early warning systems and the adoption of climate-resilient debt clauses. We reaffirm our commitments to the developed country Parties' goal of jointly mobilizing $100 billion annually in climate finance by 2020 through to 2025 in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation. We will work together with other developed country Parties in order to fully meet the goal in 2023. We welcome discussions on an ambitious and fit-for-purpose new collective quantified goal (NCQG) which contributes as a global effort, from a wide variety of sources, public and private, to reaching the goals of the Paris Agreement, including making finance flows consistent with a pathway toward low GHG emissions and climate resilient development. Recognizing the critical role of the G7 and that developed country parties should take the lead in mobilizing climate finance, we underscore the need for all countries and stakeholders, who have the capabilities and are not yet among the current providers of international climate finance, to contribute to global efforts in this regard.
21. We are committed to accelerating our own efforts to making financial flows consistent with a pathway toward low GHG emissions and climate resilient development, in line with Article 2.1c of the Paris Agreement. We stress the importance of mobilizing finance especially including private finance focusing on further implementation and development of clean technologies and activities. We underline our commitment to consistent, comparable and reliable disclosure of information on sustainability including climate. We support the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) finalizing the standards for general reporting on sustainability and for climate-related disclosures and working toward achieving globally interoperable sustainability disclosure frameworks. We also look forward to the ISSB's future work on disclosure on biodiversity and human capital, in line with its work plan consultation. We remain committed to supporting the implementation and monitoring of the G20 Sustainable Finance Roadmap. We highlight the need for corporates to implement their net-zero transitions in line with the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement based on credible corporate climate transition plans. We also highlight that transition finance, in line with keeping a limit of 1.5 °C temperature rise within reach, avoiding carbon lock-ins and based on effective emissions reduction, has a significant role in advancing the decarbonization of the economy as a whole. We look forward to an ambitious and successful second replenishment for the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and reaffirm the need for robust G7 pledges. We urge other countries to do the same and underscore the need to broaden the GCF's contributor base by encouraging all potential contributors. We continue to accelerate efforts to respond to the Glasgow Climate Pact that urges developed countries to at least double their collective provision of climate finance for adaptation to developing countries from the 2019 level by 2025, in the context of achieving a balance between mitigation and adaptation in the provision of scaled-up financial resources. We also urge MDBs to commit to ambitious adaptation finance targets, announcing revised and enhanced 2025 projections, and call on non-G7 countries to enhance provision and mobilization including private finance for adaptation. We stress the key role of International Financial Institutions (IFIs) in mobilizing finance and call on them to mainstream climate and environment issues in their policies, investments, operations and governance. We also urge MDBs to increase finance for global public goods including climate finance and support ambitious regulatory reforms in developing countries via policy-based finance in order to foster the transition to net zero and enable private sector investment. Furthermore, in order to promote the development of carbon markets while ensuring their environmental integrity, we endorse the ""Principles of High Integrity Carbon Markets"" to facilitate their implementation in carbon credit markets. We emphasize our extreme concern at the scale of impacts that are already resulting in economic and non-economic loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change and being felt globally, particularly by the most vulnerable. Alarmed by the adverse effects of climate change globally, we will scale up action and support to avert, minimize and address loss and damage, especially for the most vulnerable countries. This will include implementing the UNFCCC-COP27/The 4th session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement (CMA4) decision to establish new funding arrangements, including a fund, for developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change, in the context of article 8 of the Paris Agreement, and providing support identified in the ""G7 Inventory on Climate Disaster Risk Reduction, Response and Recovery"".
Environment
22. We commit to realizing the transformation of the economic and social system towards net-zero, circular, climate-resilient, pollution-free and nature-positive economies and to halting and reversing biodiversity loss by 2030, in an integrated manner, while ensuring sustainable and inclusive economic growth and development and enhancing the resilience of our economies. Highlighting that enhancing resource efficiency and circularity along value chains reduces primary resource use and contributes to achieving our climate and other environmental goals, we encourage stakeholders and in particular businesses to strengthen their action. Thus, we endorse the Circular Economy and Resource Efficiency Principles (CEREP). We will increase domestic and international environmentally-sound, sustainable and efficient recovery and recycling of critical minerals and raw materials and other applicable materials while increasing circularity along the supply chains. We reaffirm that management and governance of water-related ecosystems are essential for all life on earth. We are actively engaging in relevant international fora including following up on the UN Water Conference successfully held this year.
23. Building on the G7 Ocean Deal, we commit to act towards realizing clean, healthy and productive oceans. We reaffirm our commitment to end illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing and will take further actions to address this phenomenon in all its dimensions, including supporting developing countries and strengthening policy coordination among our relevant agencies and task them to take stock of their progress on this issue by the end of this year. In particular, we encourage non-parties to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Agreement on Port State Measures (PSMA) to join for further global acceptance and effective implementation of the PSMA. We welcome the conclusion of the negotiations for an international legally binding instrument under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction (BBNJ) and call for its rapid entry into force and implementation. We will continue to actively engage in the development of a regulatory framework on deep seabed mineral exploitation under the International Seabed Authority (ISA) that ensures effective protection for the marine environment from harmful effects which may arise from such activities, as required under the UNCLOS. We are committed to end plastic pollution, with the ambition to reduce additional plastic pollution to zero by 2040. With this in mind, we are determined to continue and step up our actions based on the comprehensive life cycle approach. We support the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC) process, look forward to the next round of negotiation in Paris with a view to completing its work with an international legally binding instrument covering the whole life cycle of plastics by the end of 2024 and call for ambitious outcomes. We will make as much progress as possible on these issues and on the broader agenda of ocean protection by the UN Ocean Conference in 2025.
24. We welcome the adoption of the historic Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) to halt and reverse biodiversity loss by 2030, which is fundamental to human well-being, a healthy planet and economic prosperity, and commit to its swift and full implementation and to achievement of each of its goals and targets. In this regard, G7 members that are parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) commit to revise, update and submit our National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAPs) aligned with the GBF and its goals and targets, or to communicate national targets reflecting as applicable all the goals and targets of the GBF in 2023 or sufficiently in advance of CBD-COP16. We will identify incentives, including subsidies, harmful to biodiversity by 2025, and redirect or eliminate them while scaling up positive incentives for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity by 2030 at the latest, taking initial steps without delay. We call on all signatories to swiftly implement their commitments under the GBF and stand ready to provide support to developing countries. We reiterate our commitment to substantially increase our national and international funding for nature by 2025. We will ensure that our international development assistance aligns with the GBF. We call on the MDBs to increase support for biodiversity including through leveraging financial resources from all sources and deploying a full suite of instruments. To implement the GBF, we commit to substantially and progressively increasing the level of financial resources from all sources, and to align all relevant fiscal and financial flows with the GBF and call on others to do the same. We commit to supporting the establishment of the GBF Fund within the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and its successful launch at the GEF Assembly in Vancouver in August 2023, noting the importance of financial contributions from all sources to capitalize the new fund. We reaffirm our commitment to enhance synergies between finance for climate and biodiversity, including increased funding for Nature-based Solutions. We also commit to supporting and advancing a transition to nature positive economies, including through sharing knowledge and creating information networks among the G7 such as the G7 Alliance on Nature Positive Economy. We call on businesses to progressively reduce negative and increase positive impacts on biodiversity. We look forward to the publication of the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures' (TNFD's) market framework and urge market participants, governments and regulators to support its development. We stress our commitment to achieving the target of effectively conserving and managing at least 30 percent of terrestrial and inland water areas, and at least 30 percent of marine and coastal areas by 2030 (30 by 30), nationally and globally, according to national circumstances and approaches through promoting the designation and management of protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures (OECMs). We commit to conserving and protecting global marine biological diversity and sustainably using its resources based on the best available scientific evidence. In this context, we reconfirm our commitment under the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) to adopt, as a matter of urgency, proposals to designate Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) in Eastern Antarctica, the Weddell Sea and the Western Antarctic Peninsula, based on the best available scientific evidence. In this regard, we will support other countries by sharing best practices for protected areas and OECMs to achieve the GBF target of 30 by 30. We will enhance international cooperation on measures against invasive alien species. We reiterate our commitment to halting and reversing forest loss and land degradation by 2030, and are committed to conserving forests and other terrestrial ecosystems and accelerating their restoration, supporting sustainable value and supply chains as well as promoting sustainable forest management and use of wood. We will work together, with high ambition to deliver integrated solutions to support the protection, conservation and restoration of high-carbon, high-biodiversity ecosystems, including by coordinating our offers through Country Packages on Forests, Nature and Climate, especially in countries which host vital reserves of carbon and biodiversity, with an initial focus on forests. We commit to continuing our efforts to reduce risk of deforestation and forest and land degradation linked to the production of relevant commodities and enhance cooperation with various stakeholders on this issue. We will, if appropriate, develop further regulatory frameworks or policies to support this.
Energy 
25. We commit to holistically addressing energy security, the climate crisis, and geopolitical risks. In order to address the current energy crisis caused by Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine and achieve our common goal of net-zero emissions by 2050 at the latest, we highlight the real and urgent need and opportunity to accelerate clean energy transitions also as a means of increasing energy security at the same time. While acknowledging various pathways according to each country's energy situation, industrial and social structures and geographical conditions, we highlight that these should lead to our common goal of net zero by 2050 at the latest in order to keep a limit of 1.5 °C within reach. In this regard, we invite the IEA to make recommendations by the end of this year on options how to diversify the supplies of energy and critical minerals as well as clean energy manufacturing. Through this, together with our partners, we seek to holistically address energy security, climate crisis, and geopolitical risk including the expansion of global use of renewable energy in order to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 at the latest and keep a limit of 1.5 °C temperature rise within reach. Through our experience in coping with past and current energy crises, we highlight the importance of enhanced energy efficiency and savings as the ""first fuel,"" and of developing demand side energy policies. We also need to significantly accelerate the deployment of renewable energies and the development and deployment of next-generation technologies. The G7 contributes to expanding renewable energy globally and bringing down costs by strengthening capacity including through a collective increase in offshore wind capacity of 150GW by 2030 based on each country's existing targets and a collective increase of solar PV to more than 1TW by 2030 estimated by the IEA and the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) through means such as each country's existing targets or policy measures. We recognize that low-carbon and renewable hydrogen and its derivatives such as ammonia should be developed and used, if this can be aligned with a 1.5 °C pathway, where they are impactful as effective emission reduction tools to advance decarbonization across sectors and industries, notably in hard-to-abate sectors in industry and transportation, while avoiding N2O as a GHG and NOx as air pollutant. We also note that some countries are exploring the use of low-carbon and renewable hydrogen and its derivatives in the power sector to work towards zero-emission thermal power generation if this can be aligned with a 1.5 °C pathway and our collective goal for a fully or predominantly decarbonized power sector by 2035. We will enhance our efforts to develop the rule-based, transparent global market and supply chains for low carbon and renewable hydrogen based on reliable international standards and certification schemes adhering to environmental and social standards. We affirm the importance of developing international standards and certification including for a GHG calculation methodology for hydrogen production and mutual recognition mechanism for carbon intensity-based tradability, transparency, trustworthiness and sustainability. We reaffirm our commitment to achieving a fully or predominantly decarbonized power sector by 2035, and prioritizing concrete and timely steps towards the goal of accelerating the phase-out of domestic unabated coal power generation in a manner consistent with keeping a limit of 1.5 °C temperature rise within reach and urge others to join us. We will work towards ending the construction of new unabated coal fired power generation as identified in the IEA's Coal in Net Zero Transitions report in 2022 as one of the primary actions to be taken in line with the IEA net zero by 2050 scenario. We call on and will work with other countries to end new unabated coal-fired power generation projects globally as soon as possible to accelerate the clean energy transition in a just manner. We highlight that we ended new direct government support for unabated international thermal coal power generation in 2021. We call on other countries, especially major economies to join us in fulfilling their commitments to do the same. We acknowledge that Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage (CCUS)/carbon recycling technologies can be an important part of a broad portfolio of decarbonization solutions to reduce emissions from industrial sources that cannot be avoided otherwise and that the deployment of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) processes with robust social and environmental safeguard, have an essential role to play in counterbalancing residual emissions from sectors that are unlikely to achieve full decarbonization.
26. We underline our commitment, in the context of a global effort, to accelerate the phase-out of unabated fossil fuels so as to achieve net zero in energy systems by 2050 at the latest in line with the trajectories required to limit global average temperatures to 1.5 °C above preindustrial levels, and call on others to join us in taking the same action. We reaffirm our commitment to the elimination of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies by 2025 or sooner, and reaffirm our previous calls for all countries to do so. In view of the emerging need for net-zero and circular industrial supply chains in the transformation towards a 1.5 °C pathway, we recognize the opportunities associated with decarbonized, sustainably and responsibly produced non-combustion feedstocks, and are committed to supporting our workers and communities in this transformation. We also highlight that we ended new direct public support for the international unabated fossil-fuel energy sector in 2022, except in limited circumstances clearly defined by each country consistent with a 1.5 °C warming limit and the goals of the Paris Agreement, recognizing the importance of national security and geostrategic interests. It is necessary to accelerate the phase out of our dependency on Russian energy, including through energy savings and gas demand reduction, in a manner consistent with our Paris commitments, and address the global impact of Russia's war on energy supplies, gas prices and inflation, and people's lives, recognizing the primary need to accelerate the clean energy transition. In this context, we stress the important role that increased deliveries of LNG can play, and acknowledge that investment in the sector can be appropriate in response to the current crisis and to address potential gas market shortfalls provoked by the crisis. In the exceptional circumstance of accelerating the phase out of our dependency on Russian energy, publicly supported investment in the gas sector can be appropriate as a temporary response, subject to clearly defined national circumstances, if implemented in a manner consistent with our climate objectives without creating lock-in effects, for example by ensuring that projects are integrated into national strategies for the development of low-carbon and renewable hydrogen. We will further utilize neutral and impartial statistical data made available by international organizations such as the IEA and strengthen their data-collection and analysis functions, with a view to stabilizing energy markets. We emphasize the importance of strengthening forums for communication and cooperation between producing and consuming countries with a view to stabilizing energy markets and mobilizing necessary investment consistent with climate goals. Those G7 countries that opt to use nuclear energy recognize its potential to provide affordable low-carbon energy that can reduce dependence on fossil fuels, to address the climate crisis and to ensure global energy security as a source of baseload energy and grid flexibility. They commit to maximizing the use of existing reactors safely, securely, and efficiently, including by advancing their safe long-term operation, in addressing the current energy crisis. They also commit, domestically as well as in partner countries, to supporting the development and construction of nuclear reactors, such as small modular and other advanced reactors with advanced safety systems, building robust and resilient nuclear supply chains including nuclear fuel, and maintaining and strengthening nuclear technology and human resources. They will work with like-minded partners to reduce dependence on Russia. The G7 underlines that the highest standards of nuclear safety and security are important to all countries and their respective publics. We welcome the steady progress of decommissioning work at Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings (TEPCO)'s Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station, and Japan's transparent efforts with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) based on scientific evidence. We support the IAEA's independent review to ensure that the discharge of Advanced Liquid Processing System (ALPS) treated water will be conducted consistent with IAEA safety standards and international law and that it will not cause any harm to humans and the environment, which is essential for the decommissioning of the site and the reconstruction of Fukushima.
Clean Energy Economy 
27. Emphasizing that the global climate and energy crisis highlights the urgent need to accelerate the clean energy transition towards achieving net-zero emissions no later than 2050 and to transform our energy systems, we underline the necessity of economic diversification and transformation, including in supply chains. In order to further promote clean energy transitions on a global scale, we are determined to increase our efforts and, in particular, will pursue secure, resilient, affordable, and sustainable clean energy supply chains, including those for critical minerals and clean energy technologies. In implementing energy transitions, we also reaffirm the importance of working collectively to avoid market distortions and ensuring a global level playing field. We will continue to work with international partners to realize a clean energy economy through concrete actions as laid out in the Clean Energy Economy Action Plan.
Economic Resilience and Economic Security
28. Ensuring economic resilience and economic security globally remains our best protection against the weaponization of economic vulnerabilities. Recalling our commitment from the 2022 G7 Elmau Summit, we will advance economic policies that enhance global economic resilience and economic security to protect against systemic vulnerabilities. To this end, we will engage in dialogue and follow a cooperative approach within the G7 as well as with partners beyond the G7 and globally, including in collaboration with developing countries. In so doing, we will promote international rules and norms in order to facilitate trade and promote economic resilience, based on the rules-based multilateral trading system with the World Trade Organization (WTO) at its core. Our efforts will include taking action to make our supply chains and those of our partners around the world more resilient, sustainable and reliable, as well as appropriate measures to promote prosperity for all. We will also promote trust and security in critical infrastructure. We will enhance ongoing collaboration to address non-market policies and practices that exacerbate strategic dependencies and systemic vulnerabilities, harm our workers and businesses, and can undermine international rules and norms. Building on our resolve in Elmau to increase vigilance and enhance our cooperation to address risks that undermine global security and stability, we will enhance collaboration by launching the Coordination Platform on Economic Coercion to increase our collective assessment, preparedness, deterrence and response to economic coercion, and further promote cooperation with partners beyond the G7. We will deepen our strategic dialogue against malicious practices to protect global supply chains from illegitimate influence, espionage, illicit knowledge leakage, and sabotage in the digital sphere. We affirm our shared responsibility and determination to coordinate on preventing the cutting-edge technologies we develop from being used to further military capabilities that threaten international peace and security. In this context, we hereby adopt the G7 Leaders' Statement on Economic Resilience and Economic Security.
29. We reaffirm the growing importance of critical minerals in various fields, especially for the global clean energy transition, and the need to manage economic and security risks caused by vulnerable supply chains. We support open, fair, transparent, secure, diverse, sustainable, traceable, rules- and market-based trade in critical minerals, oppose market-distorting practices and monopolistic policies on critical minerals, and reaffirm the need to build resilient, robust, responsible, and transparent critical mineral supply chains. We are committed to strengthening our preparedness and resilience against emergencies such as market disruptions, and considering ways to jointly address any such disruptions, including through the support of the IEA's ""Voluntary Critical Mineral Security Program."" We welcome joint progress in efforts to diversify supply chains, including the refining and processing of critical minerals, such as the Minerals Security Partnership (MSP). We will support local value creation in critical minerals supply chains in line with the WTO rules. We will promote domestic and international recycling of critical minerals in collaboration with developing countries. We affirm that strong environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards will ensure benefits to local communities, including people living in the vicinity of areas with mineral reserves and refining and processing plants, protect workers' rights, and promote transparency, while giving due consideration to upstream and midstream environments. In order to further promote the clean energy transition we reiterate the need to establish sustainable an resilient supply chains for critical mineral resources and products manufactured using such resources. We welcome the ""Five-Point Plan for Critical Mineral Security"" adopted by G7 Climate, Energy and Environment Ministers and instruct them to implement the plan.
Trade 
30. We stand united in our commitment to free and fair trade as foundational principles and objectives of the rules-based multilateral trading system with the WTO at its core, which proves more important than ever in the current geopolitical environment. We confirm that honoring these foundational principles is essential to creating resilient global supply chains that are transparent, diversified, secure, sustainable, trustworthy, and reliable, and that are fair for all and responsive to the needs of global citizens. We affirm our attachment to transparency, coordination and to the respect of WTO rules in our respective policies. This global trading system must be inclusive and ensure that the prosperity it can bring is felt by all, including those that have been traditionally underrepresented. To this end, we will continue to work with non-G7 partners, in particular developing country partners, which are integral partners in supply chains and in the global trading system. Based on the outcome of the 12th WTO Ministerial Conference (MC12) and looking ahead to achieving a successful MC13, we underscore the importance of working towards WTO reform, including by conducting discussions with the view to having a fully and well-functioning dispute settlement system accessible to all Members by 2024 and by reinforcing deliberation to respond to global trade policy challenges. In addition, we call on all WTO members to work together to secure the prompt entry into force of the Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies, to engage constructively on recommendations for additional provisions that would achieve a comprehensive agreement on fisheries subsidies, and the plurilateral initiatives including the joint statement initiatives (JSIs), and to make permanent the Moratorium on Customs Duties on Electronic Transmissions. We are committed to accelerating the WTO JSI E-Commerce negotiations and working to conclude an ambitious outcome by the end of 2023. The outcome should be high standard and commercially meaningful. Free and fair trade flows, consistent with our commitment to our multilateral trading system, play an important role in the green and just transition. We will continue our collaboration at the WTO including to facilitate and promote trade in environmental goods and services, and technologies. We reaffirm our shared concerns with non-market policies and practices, including their problematic evolution, that distort global competition, trade and investment. We will further step up our efforts to secure a level playing field through the more effective use of existing tools, as well as development of appropriate new tools and stronger international rules and norms. We will seek to ensure that our responses to unfair trading practices will not create unnecessary barriers to our partners' industries and are consistent with our WTO commitments. We reaffirm that export controls are a fundamental policy tool to address the challenges posed by the diversion of technology critical to military applications as well as for other activities that threaten global, regional, and national security. We affirm the importance of cooperation on export controls on critical and emerging technologies such as microelectronics and cyber surveillance systems to address the misuse of such technologies by malicious actors and inappropriate transfers of such technologies through research activities. We task our Trade Ministers to deepen these discussions towards the G7 Trade Ministers' Meeting in October, and to explore, both within and beyond the G7, coordinated or joint actions where appropriate against trade-related challenges, including economic coercion.
Food Security 
31. We remain deeply concerned with the ongoing and worsening global food security and nutrition situation, with the world facing highest risk of famine in a generation. Multiple factors including the COVID-19 pandemic, soaring energy prices, the climate crisis and shocks, biodiversity loss, land degradation, water security and armed conflicts have contributed to the global disruption and disorder in food systems and supply chains and the deterioration in global food security in recent years. In particular, Russia's illegal war of aggression against Ukraine has drastically aggravated the global food security crisis. We are committed to continuing our efforts to address pressing issues to improve global food security including through initiatives already launched by the G7 and relevant international organizations, building on the positive outcomes achieved. Stressing that we have exceeded our joint commitment of $14 billion to the global food security announced at the 2022 G7 Elmau Summit, we will continue to provide assistance in the food and nutrition related sectors to vulnerable countries and regions affected by the current food security crisis, in particular in Africa and the Middle East. Given the scale of the needs across the Horn of Africa, we have collectively met our commitment from Elmau and have effectively delivered assistance to tackle one of the worst droughts in the region's history. We also call on other international donors to step up their contributions in this regard. We further call on Russia to lift its measures that hinder the exports of Russian grain and fertilizers. Given Ukraine's essential role as a major exporter of food to the world, we are seriously concerned about the current and future impact of Russia's deliberate disruption of Ukraine's agricultural sector on food security in the most vulnerable countries. Building on our commitment made at Elmau, we continue to provide support for the restoration of Ukraine's agriculture sector, including support to its efforts in identifying and evidencing illegal seizure of Ukrainian grains by Russia, through the creation of a grain database which can be used to verify the origin of grain shipments. We reaffirm the importance of the EU-Ukraine Solidarity Lanes and President Zelenskyy's Grain from Ukraine Initiative. We reiterate the critical importance of continued and scaled-up implementation of the UN and Türkiye-brokered Black Sea Grain Initiative (BSGI) in order to further facilitate grain exports from Ukraine and enable stable supply to those in need. We call on Russia to stop threatening global food supplies and to allow the BSGI to operate at its maximum potential and for as long as necessary. We reiterate the importance of ensuring rules-based, open, fair, transparent, predictable, and non-discriminatory trade and avoiding unjustified restrictive trade measures to keep the food and agricultural markets open and call on our G20 partners to do the same. We welcome the Ministerial Decision on World Food Programme (WFP) Food Purchases Exemption from Export Prohibitions or Restrictions adopted at the MC12 and call for its full implementation. We call for more concrete actions to address export restrictions imposed by agricultural producer countries on global food security, recognizing that such measures have a disproportionate effect on countries at greater risk of famine and acute food insecurity. We emphasize the necessity of market transparency and accurate information backed by neutral and impartial data and analysis to prevent arbitrary measures and reduce market volatility in addressing ongoing and future food crises, and commit to strengthening the G20 Agricultural Market Information System (AMIS) as well as various efforts by international organizations in this regard. We underscore the importance of strengthening the capacity of low and lower-middle income countries to collect, analyze and use high quality agricultural, market and food security data and maintain the quality of data. We also recognize the value of dialogue between food exporting countries and importing countries to develop a shared understanding on crisis responses.
32. We share the view that it is essential to focus on each human and enable stable access to affordable, safe, sufficient and nutritious food for each and every individual. In our pursuit to ensure that all people can progressively realize their right to adequate food, we affirm the need to protect and assist members of the most vulnerable populations, including women and children, in all aspects of food security from short-term food crisis responses through medium to long-term efforts to make food systems sustainable. Nutrition is also fundamental from the viewpoint of a human centered approach, and we highlight the importance of improving access to healthy diets, including through school meal programs. We recognize the urgent need of establishing inclusive, resilient and sustainable agriculture and food systems including through enhancing, diversifying and ensuring sustainability of local, regional and global food supply chains as well as through solving structural bottlenecks. This includes increasing local production capacities by making use of existing domestic agricultural resources and by facilitating trade, sustainable productivity growth with climate adaptation and mitigation and biodiversity conservation, and sustainable food consumption. We promote a wide range of innovations and technology which is suitable for local, environmental and farming conditions and benefits all stakeholders including smallholder farmers. We also underscore the role of the private sector, including small and medium enterprises and startups, in research and development (R&D) as well as responsible investment. We recognize the need to maintain the availability, affordability and accessibility of fertilizers, to diversify the production to reduce the impact of supply chain disruptions, and to promote more efficient and responsible use of fertilizers and soil health, including through the use of appropriate and safe fertilizers, for stable and sustainable agricultural production. We acknowledge the importance of supporting fertilizer value chains including local fertilizer production in line with WTO rules and through supporting the use of local sources of energy in consistency with a 1.5 °C warming limit and the goals of the Paris Agreement. We strengthen broader partnerships on those efforts including through the UN Food Systems Stocktaking Moments. We commit to taking concrete steps with partner countries as outlined in the annexed ""Hiroshima Action Statement for Resilient Global Food Security"", and call for broader cooperation in the international community.
Health 
33. We renew our strong commitment to developing and strengthening the global health architecture (GHA) with the World Health Organization (WHO) at its core for future public health emergencies to break the cycle of panic and neglect, recognizing that the COVID-19 pandemic has made an unprecedented impact on the international community. To this end, we commit to further enhancing political momentum toward more coordinated and sustained leader-level governance for health emergency prevention, preparedness and response (PPR) that ensures legitimacy, representation, equity, and effectiveness, noting the ongoing discussions including on a new instrument on pandemic PPR (WHO CA+), targeted amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR), and the UN General Assembly (UNGA) High-Level Meeting (HLM) on pandemic PPR in September 2023 and the need to avoid duplication and ensure coherence between these processes, stressing the leading role of WHO. We also applaud the landmark decision at the 75th WHA to work towards increasing the share of assessed contributions to 50 percent of WHO's 2022-2023 base budget, and which takes into account the importance of monitoring of budgetary proposals as well as progress on reforms, with a view to sustainably finance the organisation to fulfil its leading and coordinating role in global health. We also reaffirm our commitment to strengthening collaboration between Finance and Health Ministries for pandemic PPR including through the ongoing and essential work of the G20 Joint Finance and Health Task Force (JFHTF). We welcome the launch of the Pandemic Fund (PF), look forward to the successful execution of its first call for proposals, and encourage active participation and increasing contributions to the PF from a broader donor base. We also commit to working together, including by sharing work plans and tracking, encouraging efforts and progress in priority countries to achieve the G7's target of supporting at least 100 Low and Middle Income Countries (LMICs) in implementing the core capacities required in the IHR, for another 5 years until 2027 as committed in 2022. We also highlight the need for strengthening financing for pandemic response. To this end, we commit to thoroughly assess how existing financing sources can be used in pandemic response and to explore a surge financing framework that allows us to complement existing mechanisms through better coordination and deploy necessary funds quickly and efficiently in response to outbreaks without accumulating idle cash. In this respect, we welcome the G7 Shared Understanding on Finance-Health Coordination and PPR Financing endorsed by the G7 Finance and Health Ministers at their joint session. Reaffirming that strengthening international norms and regulations is essential to enhance pandemic PPR, guided by equity, we reiterate our commitment to contributing to and sustaining momentum on the negotiations of WHO CA+ with a view to adopting it by May 2024 and on the negotiations of targeted amendments to strengthen the IHR, together with all stakeholders. Furthermore, we reiterate the importance of timely, transparent and systematic sharing of pathogens, data and information in a safe and secure manner, ensuring the respect of relevant data protection rules, for multisectoral and integrated surveillance of emerging and ongoing health threats both in ordinary times and in emergencies, in line with the G7 Pact for Pandemic Readiness. We also recognize the importance of strengthening and maintaining sufficient and high-quality human resources for health worldwide at all times, such as the public health and emergency workforce including consideration of Global Health Emergency Corps. We will support the further enhancement of a global network of experts and trainings, including through initiatives such as the WHO Academy, promote decent work with equal payment for work of equal value and protect health workers during emergencies and conflicts among others. We recognize the integral role civil society plays, including by reaching those in vulnerable situations, and recommit to working together for a healthier future for all.
34. We commit to reverse the first global decline in life expectancy in more than seven decades emphasizing the importance of achieving UHC by 2030 and accelerating progress toward SDG 3. We recommit to working alongside global partners to assist countries to achieve UHC by supporting primary health care (PHC) and developing and restoring essential health services, to achieve better than pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2025, as part of our effort to strengthen health systems in ordinary times. We commit to supporting countries to strengthen PHC delivery, including through health workforce strengthening We also commit to support bringing survival rates back to better than pre-pandemic levels, including by reducing maternal, newborn and child mortality, and consistent with the full range of SDG targets and indicators related to UHC on which we will also support progress. We recognize the importance of financial risk protection to prevent people from slipping into poverty due to health care costs. To this end, we endorse the ""G7 Global Plan for UHC Action Agenda"" and note the importance of a global hub function, in support of relevant international organizations, including for financing, knowledge management, and human resources on UHC. We reaffirm the essential role of UHC in addressing various health challenges significantly set back by the pandemic, including in humanitarian contexts, such as tackling communicable diseases including HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, hepatitis, malaria, polio, measles, cholera, and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), antimicrobial resistance (AMR), non-communicable diseases (NCDs) including mental health conditions, realizing comprehensive sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) for all, and promoting routine immunization, healthy ageing, and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH). We are committed to spearheading research in this regard, including with a focus on understanding post COVID-19 conditions. We noted the historic outcome of the Global Fund's 7th replenishment and welcome the financial support from the G7 and further countries towards ending the epidemics of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. We call for continued support to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) to stay on track for polio eradication by 2026. We will build on the success of the Tokyo Nutrition for Growth (N4G) Summit in 2021 for the Paris N4G in 2024 to improve nutrition. We also commit to further promoting comprehensive sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) for all individuals, including maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health, especially in vulnerable circumstances. Recognizing the increasing need for overarching, system-level coordination and alignment of global health partnerships including the Global Health Initiatives and their interface, we will take collective actions to avoid fragmentation and duplication, ensure accountability, maximize impacts, and reinforce country leadership with a view to enhancing governance in global health and to supporting the achievement of UHC. In this regard, we look forward to the outcome of the Future of Global Health Initiatives. We reiterate our determination to further contribute to achieving UHC, including through making the most of and ensuring synergies among the upcoming UNGA HLMs on UHC, tuberculosis, and pandemic PPR. In order to contribute to global health towards the post COVID-19 era, with a view to supporting the achievement of UHC as well as strengthening PPR, we highlight our financial contributions totaling more than $48 billion from the public and private sectors. We also call for further domestic resource mobilization as well as efficient use of existing resources. We emphasize the important role of the private sector towards sustainable financing in global health, including through impact investments and endorse the Triple I (Impact Investments Initiative) for Global Health.
35. We reaffirm that innovative initiatives including those related to digital health are keys to strengthening GHA and achieving UHC. We will reiterate the urgent need to foster innovation and to strengthen research and development of safe, effective, quality-assured and affordable medical countermeasures (MCMs) as underlined by the 100 Days Mission. We commit to enhancing equitable access to MCM, including by addressing issues relating to manufacturing and delivery. In this regards, we will continue to contribute to ongoing processes, including in the G20, on an end-to-end MCM ecosystem, aligned with the ongoing discussions on the WHO CA+ and which should actively contribute to the diversification of MCM production and address the priority of the most vulnerable partner's needs and expectations, including in terms of global governance, in cooperation with relevant partners including the WHO, the WB, UN Children's Fund (UNICEF), the Global Fund, Gavi the Vaccine Alliance, Global Health Innovative Technology (GHIT) Fund, Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND) and Unitaid and Medicines Patent Pool, regional organizations and the private sector. To this end, we announce the G7 Hiroshima Vision for Equitable Access to MCMs and launch the MCM Delivery Partnership for equitable access (MCDP) to contribute to more equitable access to and delivery of MCMs based on the principles of equity, inclusivity, efficiency, affordability, quality, accountability, agility and speed. We commit to work across providers of development finance, for the purpose of identifying concrete options this summer for providing for the liquidity for global health organizations to procure and deliver MCMs earlier in a crisis. This supports the mapping exercise for surge financing to be conducted by the WHO and World Bank and presented at the G20 Finance and Health Task Force and the UNGA HLM, contributing to ongoing negotiations on the WHO CA+. We also reiterate our commitment to addressing global health threats including those exacerbated by climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution through integrated measures and by applying a holistic One Health approach. Recognizing the rapid escalation of AMR globally, we continue to commit to exploring and implementing push and pull incentives to accelerate R&D of antimicrobials as well as promoting antimicrobial access and stewardship for their prudent and appropriate use toward the UNGA HLM on AMR in 2024. We remain committed to promoting policies and resources to care for people living with dementia and welcome the development of potentially disease modifying therapies for the various types of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease.
Labor 
36. We emphasize the importance of investment in human capital to ensure a just transition, in response to structural changes such as digital and green transformations as well as demographic changes including societies that are ageing, in part due to declining birth rates. In order to facilitate these transformations, we commit to supporting individuals through reskilling and upskilling measures, along with a combination of appropriate social protection and active labor market policies. As reskilling and upskilling to support workers to adapt to these changes are investments in human capital and should not be seen as a cost, we must continue to provide adequate investment necessary to address workforce transition needs including vocational training and life-long learning. We commit to efforts towards achieving a virtuous cycle of workers' well-being and social and economic vitality, which will lead to sustainable growth and real wage growth in line with productivity, contributing in turn to further investment in human capital. We emphasize that freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining play an important role in promoting decent work and wage growth. We are resolved to build an inclusive labor market that ensures decent and good quality jobs for all and leaves no one behind, especially, women and under-represented groups, including persons with disabilities, older persons and youth, while engaging constructively with social partners and other stakeholders. We also work towards quality job creation, universal access to social protection, and further improving gender equality in the labor market. The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected women and girls, and has highlighted the unequal distribution of care work as a key cause of gender inequalities, while showing the essential role paid and unpaid care work plays in the functioning of our societies and economies. We commit to addressing underlying discriminatory social and gender norms, such as unequal sharing of paid and unpaid care-work and housework, promoting and protecting social security including parental leave, providing support for childcare and other field of care work and care economy, including by facilitating access to infrastructures and long-term care. In particular, we reaffirm the need to support and promote parenthood protection to ensure parents can combine work and family and personal life and actively contribute to all spheres of our society. We also highlight the need to recognize, reduce and redistribute unpaid care, reward care workers fairly, while generating sufficient care jobs to meet the demand for care, and give care workers representation in social dialogue and collective bargaining. We recognize the importance of enhancing work engagement and worker retention through various measures such as promoting health and well-being at work, ensuring occupational safety and health, and supporting the inclusive and equitable career development of workers. We commit to promoting decent work in line with SDG 8, including through technical cooperation, as well as ensuring respect for international labor standards and human rights in global value chains, in particular the fundamental conventions adopted by the International Labor Organisation (ILO). We reiterate our commitment to the effective abolition of all forms of forced and compulsory labor and child labor. We reaffirm our commitment to taking measures to strengthen our cooperation and collective efforts towards eradicating all forms of forced labor from global supply chains. We commit to continuing to promote decent work and protect rights-holders in global supply chains through a smart mix of mandatory and voluntary measures, including through legislation, regulations, incentives and guidance for enterprises and to engage constructively in discussions at the UN and the ILO in close consultation with all relevant stakeholders to explore ideas and options for a consensus-based legally binding instrument at the international level that adds value to the existing legal and policy approaches and is implementable. We endorse the Action Plan for Promoting Career Development and Greater Resilience to Structural Changes developed by Labor and Employment Ministers.
Education 
37. We commit to making progress for ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education, including vocational education, and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all to build resilient, just and prospering societies. Recent crises have led to decreased access to education and increased learning loss amongst children and youth, especially girls, and those in the most marginalized and vulnerable situations. As education is a catalyst to achieving all of the SDGs, we reaffirm the importance of upholding education and building more resilient education systems, especially following the COVID-19 pandemic. We reiterate our firm determination to uphold the G7's previous commitments to protecting educational opportunities for all learners, and to promoting gender equality as well as the empowerment of all women and girls in all their diversity, in and through education including by prioritizing global ODA in this regard. We welcome the UNSG's Transforming Education Summit (TES) in September 2022, and call for continued support to the Global Partnership for Education (GPE), Education Cannot Wait (ECW) and UN agencies including the UNESCO and UNICEF as key partners in helping countries to build stronger education systems for the most marginalized children. We also reiterate the importance of foundational learning and the need for the G7 to increase investment in people in a more equitable and efficient way to provide quality learning opportunities that prepare all learners, especially children with the knowledge and skills they need to thrive and improve their own well-being, noting that education is a human right. We continue to break down gender-related barriers and underlying discriminatory social norms from pre-primary through higher education for more resilient, inclusive and gender-transformative education. We continue to encourage international exchanges between youth and international talent mobility and circulation among academics, students, and researchers, as well as cooperation between higher education and research institutions. We acknowledge the importance of investment in support of human resources that can contribute to resolving social issues while simultaneously achieving economic growth through education. We will strive for an educational environment and lifelong learning opportunities where every child can fulfil their own potential, including through the improvement of instruction. This could include promoting small class size, an improved Information and Communication Technology (ICT) environment and the effective use of digital technology to support teaching and learning, while not exacerbating the digital equality gaps.
Digital 
38. We recognize that, while rapid technological change has been strengthening societies and economies, the international governance of new digital technologies has not necessarily kept pace. As the pace of technological evolution accelerates, we affirm the importance to address common governance challenges and to identify potential gaps and fragmentation in global technology governance. In areas such as AI, immersive technologies such as the metaverses and quantum information science and technology and other emerging technologies, the governance of the digital economy should continue to be updated in line with our shared democratic values. These include fairness, accountability, transparency, safety, protection from online harassment, hate and abuse and respect for privacy and human rights, fundamental freedoms and the protection of personal data. We will work with technology companies and other relevant stakeholders to drive the responsible innovation and implementation of technologies, ensuring that safety and security is prioritized, and that platforms are tackling the threats of child sexual exploitation and abuse on their platforms, and upholding the children's rights to safety and privacy online. We continue to discuss ways to advance technology for democracy and to cooperate on new and emerging technologies and their social implementation, and look forward to an inclusive, multi-stakeholder dialogue on digital issues, including on Internet Governance, through relevant fora, including the OECD Global Forum on Technology. We commit to further advancing multi-stakeholder approaches to the development of standards for AI, respectful of legally binding frameworks, and recognize the importance of procedures that advance transparency, openness, fair processes, impartiality, privacy and inclusiveness to promote responsible AI. We stress the importance of international discussions on AI governance and interoperability between AI governance frameworks, while we recognize that approaches and policy instruments to achieve the common vision and goal of trustworthy AI may vary across G7 members. We support the development of tools for trustworthy AI through multi-stakeholder international organizations, and encourage the development and adoption of international technical standards in standards development organizations through multi-stakeholder processes. We recognize the need to immediately take stock of the opportunities and challenges of generative AI, which is increasingly prominent across countries and sectors, and encourage international organizations such as the OECD to consider analysis on the impact of policy developments and Global Partnership on AI (GPAI) to conduct practical projects. In this respect, we task relevant ministers to establish the Hiroshima AI process, through a G7 working group, in an inclusive manner and in cooperation with the OECD and GPAI, for discussions on generative AI by the end of this year. These discussions could include topics such as governance, safeguard of intellectual property rights including copy rights, promotion of transparency, response to foreign information manipulation, including disinformation, and responsible utilization of these technologies. We welcome the Action Plan for promoting global interoperability between tools for trustworthy AI from the Digital and Tech Ministers' Meeting. We recognize the potential of immersive technologies, and virtual worlds, such as metaverses to provide innovative opportunities, in all industrial and societal sectors, as well as to promote sustainability. For this purpose, governance, public safety, and human rights challenges should be addressed at the global level. We task our relevant Ministers to consider collective approaches in this area, including in terms of interoperability, portability and standards, with the support of the OECD. We express our interest in possible joint cooperation in research and development on computing technologies. We also task our relevant Ministers to consider ways to further promote digital trade.
39. We reaffirm that cross-border data flows, information, ideas and knowledge generate higher productivity, greater innovation, and improved sustainable development, while raising challenges related to privacy, data protection, intellectual property protection, and security including that of data and cloud infrastructure. We reiterate the importance of facilitating Data Free Flow with Trust (DFFT) to enable trustworthy cross-border data flows and invigorate the digital economy as a whole, while preserving governments' ability to address legitimate public interest. We stress our intention to operationalize this concept and our support for cooperation within the G7 and beyond to work towards identifying commonalities, complementarities and elements of convergence between existing regulatory approaches and instruments enabling data to flow with trust, in order to foster future interoperability such as through supporting multi-stakeholder engagement, leveraging the role of technologies, and clarifying domestic and municipal policies and due processes. In this regard, we endorse the Annex on G7 Vision for Operationalising DFFT and its Priorities from the Digital and Tech Ministers' Meeting, and the establishment of the Institutional Arrangement for Partnership. We task our relevant Ministers to continue working to deliver substantive outcomes and subsequently report back to us. We welcome the OECD Declaration on Government Access to Personal Data Held by Private Sector Entities as an instrument to increase trust in cross-border data flows among countries committed to democratic values and the rule of law. We emphasize our opposition to internet fragmentation and the use of digital technologies to infringe on human rights. In this context, we should counter unjustified obstacles to the free flow of data, lacking transparency, and arbitrarily operated, which should be distinguished from our measures implemented to achieve the legitimate public policy interests of each country. We seek to increase trust across our digital ecosystem and to counter the influence of authoritarian approaches. We recognize the importance of secure and resilient digital infrastructure as the foundation of society and the economy. We are committed to deepen our cooperation within the G7 and with like-minded partners to support and enhance network resilience by measures such as extending secure routes of submarine cables. We welcome supplier diversification efforts in ICTS supply chains and continue to discuss market trends towards open, interoperable approaches, alongside secure, resilient and established architecture in a technology neutral way. Under the Japanese G7 Presidency and against the background of early deployments of Open Radio Access Network (RAN), we have exchanged views on open architectures and security-related aspects and opportunities. We recognize the need to bridge the digital divides, including the gender digital divide, and the importance of initiatives to use data and technology for cities, such as smart city initiatives, to promote digital inclusion and address challenges in urban development. We will facilitate inclusive development and enable greater employability and movement of digital experts, and restate our commitment to supporting other countries to increase digital access under principles of equity, universality and affordability while ensuring that security, interoperability, the protection of personal data and respect for human rights including gender equality are built into global connectivity.
Science and Technology 
40. We support the development of advanced technologies, research infrastructures and highly-skilled human resource networks that will drive innovation to solve global challenges and enable the next stage of economic growth. To this end, we promote international talent mobility and circulation. The G7 will promote open science by equitably disseminating scientific knowledge, publicly funded research outputs including research data and scholarly publications following the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) principles. This will enable researchers and people to benefit from and contribute to creating knowledge, innovation and solutions to global challenges. We further commit to working together to promote responsible global science and technology cooperation and use of emerging technologies such as advanced computing and biotechnology with partners sharing common values and principles in research and innovation. This includes a better understanding of the seas and the ocean in the context of climate change and utilizing very large research infrastructures. We are committed to fostering and promoting a common understanding of values and principles in research and innovation through dedicated multilateral dialogues, including in the area of research security and research integrity, and international joint research based on the philosophy of open science. We welcome the forthcoming launch of the G7 Virtual Academy and release of the Best Practices Paper on Research Security and Integrity. These efforts will contribute to addressing the various challenges that arise at the intersection of security, economy, and scientific research.
41. We reiterate our commitment to promoting the safe and sustainable use of outer space, given our ever-greater reliance on space systems. Restating the importance of addressing the issues of space debris, we strongly support the implementation of international guidelines adopted at the UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space as urgent and necessary. We welcome national efforts to develop further solutions for space debris mitigation and remediation as well as further research and development of orbital debris mitigation and remediation technologies. Furthermore, we commit not to conducting destructive direct-ascent anti-satellite missile testing and encourage others to follow suit in order to ensure the security, stability and sustainability of outer space.
Gender 
42. Achieving gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls is fundamental for a resilient, fair, and prosperous society. We endeavor to work with all segments of society to ensure full, equal and meaningful participation of women and girls in all their diversity as well as LGBTQIA+ persons in politics, economics, education and all other spheres of society, and to consistently mainstream gender equality in all policy areas. In this respect, we commit to redoubling our efforts to overcome longstanding structural barriers and to addressing harmful gender norms, stereotypes, roles, and practices through such means as education and achieve a society where diversity, human rights and dignity are respected, promoted and protected and all people can enjoy vibrant lives free from violence and discrimination independent of gender identity or expression or sexual orientation. We welcome the work of the Gender Equality Advisory Council (GEAC) and look forward to strengthening it further. We look forward to the first revision of the G7 Dashboard on Gender Gaps and the publication of the first implementation report this year, which aims to monitor past G7 commitments to make progress on gender equality.
43. We express our strong concern about the rollback of women's and girls' rights in particular in time of crisis and we strongly condemn all violations and abuses of human rights and fundamental freedoms for women and girls and LGBTQIA+ people around the world. We further recognize the essential and transformative role of comprehensive SRHR in gender equality and women's and girls' empowerment, and in supporting diversity, including of sexual orientations and gender identities. We reaffirm our full commitment to achieving comprehensive SRHR for all, including by addressing access to safe and legal abortion and post abortion care. We are committed to championing, advancing and defending gender equality and the rights of women and girls in all their diversity, at home and abroad, and will work together to thwart attempts to undermine and reverse hard-won progress in this area. In this regard, we commit to advancing, implementing and strengthening the Women, Peace and Security (WPS) Agenda including its application to disaster risk reduction (DRR), through partnership with the WPS-Focal Points Network and support for National Action Plan development, and to promote intersectional approaches. We highlight the leading role of women in preventing violent conflict, delivering relief and recovery efforts, and forging lasting peace, and pledge to champion the full, equal and meaningful participation of women in peace and political processes. We commit to strengthening our efforts to eliminate conflict-related sexual and gender-based violence, and the importance of providing comprehensive support and meaningful participation for victims and survivors, using a survivor-centered approach. We further commit to eliminating all forms of sexual and gender-based harassment and abuse both offline and online as well as aid-related sexual exploitation and abuse. We are committed to ensuring the right to education for all, and emphasize the importance of promoting equitable access to safe, gender-transformative quality education as well as to taking measures to close the gender gap in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) sectors and education, and close the gender digital gap. We see this as key to promote women's entrepreneurship, which is an essential building block to address the climate, nature and development challenges. We also commit to promoting reskilling and upskilling, fostering decent work conditions, strengthening financial inclusion of women in all their diversity, and eliminating the gender pay gap. We further reiterate our commitments to promoting women's full empowerment as well as their full and equal participation in decision-making processes at all levels, including in leadership positions. We recognize that quality care plays an essential role in the functioning of our societies and economies, but is a key cause of gender inequalities due to its gender unequal distribution.
44. To advance our commitments, we emphasize the need to overcome the fragmentation and marginalization of gender equality issues by enhancing our efforts to integrate and deepening gender mainstreaming for a substantial transformation of our societies. In this regard, we call for a continuous, holistic and comprehensive approach to promote gender equality by creating a ""nexus"" that bridges the political and security, economic and social spheres and advocate for maximizing the efficiency and the impact of multi-sectorial policies and of our actions across diverse dimensions of policy implementation. We stress the importance of such a nexus approach in our foreign and sustainable development policy and in our ODA and endeavor to support the nexus. We reaffirm our commitment to make every effort to collectively increase the share of our bilateral allocable ODA advancing gender equality and women's and girls' empowerment over the coming years. In this regard, we welcome ""the Fact Sheet: Promoting Gender Mainstreaming through the nexus approach"" made by our experts and look forward to further progress in this area.
Human Rights, Refugees, Migration, Democracy 
45. We reaffirm our commitment to upholding human rights and dignity of all, as set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, so that everyone can participate fully and equally in society. We commit to firmly speaking out against human rights violations and abuses, and at the same time, listening to and assisting the countries and civil society organizations that seek to defend and promote human rights through dialogue and cooperation. Recognizing the need to deepen discussions within and beyond the G7 on business and human rights, we intend to strengthen cooperation and collective efforts, including by accelerating exchange of information, towards ensuring respect for human rights and international labor standards in business activities and global supply chains, and further enhancing resilience, predictability and certainty for businesses, and call upon others to join us in these efforts. We reaffirm our commitment to protecting refugees, supporting forcibly displaced persons and supporting host countries and communities, ensuring the full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms of refugees and displaced persons, and defending and promoting the rights of marginalized people or persons facing vulnerable conditions exacerbated by conflict, crisis, and displacement, including freedom from sexual and gender-based violence. We call upon the international community to follow suit. We commit to fighting against impunity and holding perpetrators to account for the most serious crimes of international concern, including conflict-related sexual violence, together with improving documentation. In this regard, we recall the need to strengthen international architecture to prevent conflict-related sexual violence in the future. We acknowledge the importance of the discussions of the International Law Commission's draft articles on the prevention and punishment of crimes against humanity. We continue to work with the international community towards the second Global Refugee Forum in December 2023. We reaffirm our commitment to support the full inclusion of refugees, in the spirit of international cooperation and in line with the Global Compact on Refugees, national policies, legislation, and circumstances, ensuring full respect for their human rights and fundamental freedoms.
46. We reaffirm our commitment to ensuring the safe, orderly, and regular migration around the world. We recognize the important economic and social benefits that migrants can bring to our countries. We commit to ensure full respect for their human rights and fundamental freedoms regardless of their migration status. We remain committed to preventing irregular and often highly dangerous migration whether by land or sea. We commit to joint efforts to tackle the organized criminal networks which facilitate illegal migration and the dangerous journey of migrants and asylum seekers, profiting off some of the most vulnerable. We call for firmness in dealing with this ruthless criminality that puts lives in danger and poses risks to the internal security of G7 partners. In this regard, we will intensify efforts to break the business model of organized criminal networks, including through cooperation to disrupt the supply chains that enable the criminal and exploitative operations of those engaged in the trafficking and smuggling of human beings. To this end, we will task relevant Ministers to deepen partnerships to enhance our understanding of the root causes and work together with partners around the world to address this complex challenge.
47. We reaffirm our shared belief that democracy is the most enduring means to advance peace, prosperity, equality and sustainable development. We reaffirm our commitment to protecting the information environment by supporting media freedom and online freedom, including protection from online harassment and abuse, internet shutdowns and disruptions, as well as addressing foreign information manipulation and interference, including disinformation, which is designed to undermine trust in democratic institutions, and sow discord in the international community. We strongly condemn the widespread use of information manipulation and interference by Russia in order to gain support for its war of aggression against Ukraine and to obscure the facts of its aggression. Through the G7 Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM), we will work to strengthen our collective efforts to counter threats to democracy, including such manipulation, with full respect for international human rights law, in particular freedom of expression. We will work towards ensuring that fact-based, quality and trustworthy information is promoted, and call on digital platforms to support this approach. We will increase cooperation on these issues with government and non-governmental partners from all regions who share the determination to promote access to such information, including through supporting relevant international initiatives, such as the Partnership for Information and Democracy, and efforts by the UN and OECD.
Countering Terrorism, Violent Extremism and Transnational Organized Crime/Upholding the Rule of Law/Anti-Corruption 
48. We reiterate our strong commitment to working together with all relevant actors to counter all forms of terrorism and violent extremism, both online and offline, as well as transnational organized crime, including drug trafficking, human trafficking, child sexual abuse and exploitation, corruption, fraud, intellectual property theft, ransomware threats, cybercrime and environmental crimes, as well as money laundering and terrorist financing in a unified, coordinated, inclusive, transparent and human-rights-based, gender-responsive manner. In countering the exploitation of new and emerging technologies for terrorist purposes and countering the misuses of technologies for criminal purposes, we will continue our utmost efforts to enhance global cooperation and digital response capacity. In this regard, building on our collaboration and on efforts through existing frameworks such as the Christchurch Call, and recalling previous commitments, including maintaining tightly controlled lawful access, we call on the private sector to step up their efforts to address the problem of dissemination of terrorist and violent extremist content online and to prioritize safety by design, and stop, in particular, child sexual exploitation and abuse on their platforms. We support the efforts of our partner countries to sign and ratify the relevant international agreements such as the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the UN Convention against Corruption (UNCAC), and those of the Council of Europe such as the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, in the wide spectrum of cooperation by criminal justice and other relevant authorities that form the basis for efficient cross-border cooperation. We also recognize the significant public health and security threat of illicit synthetic drugs and will strengthen our cooperation to address it, engaging with other willing countries and the private sector.
49. We will also strengthen bilateral, regional and multilateral coordination and cooperation in the field of law and justice, such as providing technical assistance to countries to develop and implement laws, and capacity building related to the justice sector. We will continue to step up our fight against corruption, promoting good governance and strengthening accountable, transparent, equitable and community-oriented law enforcement to make progress on many of our shared priorities, which will lead to safer and more secure societies and thus contribute to the promotion of the rule of law and respect for human rights. We further recognize that corruption and related illicit finance and proceeds of crime drain public resources, can often fuel organized crime, enable kleptocratic systems to accumulate wealth and power at the expense of citizens, and undermine democratic governance. We will pursue a stronger and more unified approach in rigorously enforcing international anti-corruption obligations and standards, and enhancing law enforcement cooperation, including through relevant regional and international organizations, and holding corrupt actors accountable. Recalling the importance of beneficial ownership transparency for the integrity and transparency of democratic systems, we reaffirm the importance of supporting African partners in establishing and strengthening registers of beneficial ownership.
Regional Affairs 
50. We stand together on core foreign policy and security challenges to build a more secure and prosperous future. We also reaffirm our determination to work with a wide range of partners to address pressing global challenges and to ensure that the international system is able to respond effectively to these issues.
51. We stand together as G7 partners on the following elements, which underpin our respective relations with China:
We stand prepared to build constructive and stable relations with China, recognizing the importance of engaging candidly with and expressing our concerns directly to China. We act in our national interest. It is necessary to cooperate with China, given its role in the international community and the size of its economy, on global challenges as well as areas of common interest.
We call on China to engage with us, including in international fora, on areas such as the climate and biodiversity crisis and the conservation of natural resources in the framework of the Paris and Kunming-Montreal Agreements, addressing vulnerable countries' debt sustainability and financing needs, global health and macroeconomic stability.
Our policy approaches are not designed to harm China nor do we seek to thwart China's economic progress and development. A growing China that plays by international rules would be of global interest. We are not decoupling or turning inwards. At the same time, we recognize that economic resilience requires de-risking and diversifying. We will take steps, individually and collectively, to invest in our own economic vibrancy. We will reduce excessive dependencies in our critical supply chains.
With a view to enabling sustainable economic relations with China, and strengthening the international trading system, we will push for a level playing field for our workers and companies. We will seek to address the challenges posed by China's non-market policies and practices, which distort the global economy. We will counter malign practices, such as illegitimate technology transfer or data disclosure. We will foster resilience to economic coercion. We also recognize the necessity of protecting certain advanced technologies that could be used to threaten our national security without unduly limiting trade and investment.
We remain seriously concerned about the situation in the East and South China Seas. We strongly oppose any unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force or coercion.
We reaffirm the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait as indispensable to security and prosperity in the international community. There is no change in the basic positions of the G7 members on Taiwan, including stated one China policies. We call for a peaceful resolution of cross-Strait issues.
We will keep voicing our concerns about the human rights situation in China, including in Tibet and Xinjiang where forced labor is of major concern to us. We call on China to honor its commitments under the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law, which enshrine rights, freedoms and a high degree of autonomy for Hong Kong.
We call on China to act in accordance with its obligations under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the Vienna Convention on Consular relations, and not to conduct interference activities aimed at undermining the security and safety of our communities, the integrity of our democratic institutions and our economic prosperity.
We call on China to press Russia to stop its military aggression, and immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw its troops from Ukraine. We encourage China to support a comprehensive, just and lasting peace based on territorial integrity and the principles and purposes of the UN Charter, including through its direct dialogue with Ukraine.
52. There is no legal basis for China's expansive maritime claims in the South China Sea, and we oppose China's militarization activities in the region. We emphasize the universal and unified character of the UNCLOS and reaffirm UNCLOS's important role in setting out the legal framework that governs all activities in the oceans and the seas. We reiterate that the award rendered by the Arbitral Tribunal on July 12, 2016, is a significant milestone, which is legally binding upon the parties to those proceedings, and a useful basis for peacefully resolving disputes between the parties.
53. We strongly condemn North Korea's unprecedented number of unlawful ballistic missile launches, each of which violated multiple UN Security Council Resolutions (UNSCRs). We demand that North Korea refrain from any other destabilizing or escalatory actions, including any further nuclear tests or launches that use ballistic missile technology, which undermine regional stability and pose a grave threat to international peace and security. Such reckless actions must be met with a swift, united, and robust international response. This must include further significant measures to be taken by the UN Security Council. We reiterate our unwavering commitment to the goal of North Korea's complete, verifiable, and irreversible abandonment of its nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programs, and any other weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and ballistic missile programs in accordance with relevant UNSCRs. We are concerned about North Korea's choice to prioritize its unlawful WMD and ballistic missile programs over the welfare of the people in North Korea. We call on North Korea to accept repeated offers of dialogue, including from Japan, the United States, and the Republic of Korea. We urge North Korea to respect human rights, facilitate access for international humanitarian organizations, and resolve the abductions issue immediately.
54. We remain deeply concerned about the deteriorating security, humanitarian, human rights, and political situation in Myanmar, and we express our solidarity with its people. We continue to support ASEAN's efforts including its continued engagements with all stakeholders in Myanmar to implement the Five-Point Consensus, including through Indonesia as the ASEAN Chair and ASEAN special envoy to Myanmar. We continue to call on the Myanmar military to immediately cease all violence, release all political prisoners and those arbitrarily detained, create an environment for an inclusive and peaceful dialogue, and return the country to a genuinely democratic path. We reiterate our call on all states to prevent the flow of arms into Myanmar. We also call for full, safe, and unimpeded humanitarian access to all people, especially the most vulnerable.
55. We note with grave concern increased threats to stability and the dire humanitarian and economic situation in Afghanistan. We call on the Taliban to uphold its counterterrorism commitments and to ensure the territory of Afghanistan cannot be used to threaten or attack any country, to plan or finance terrorist acts, or to shelter and train terrorists. We express our strongest opposition to the Taliban's systematic violations on human rights and fundamental freedoms, and call for the immediate reversal of unacceptable decisions, especially those against women and girls. All Afghans must enjoy full, equal, and meaningful participation in all spheres of public life, and have access to humanitarian assistance and basic services. We call upon the Taliban to respect UNSCR 2681/2023 and the UN Charter, including Article 8, and to ensure unrestricted operations of the UN in Afghanistan. To remedy the persistent lack of political inclusivity and representation, we urge the Taliban to take significant steps to engage in credible, inclusive and Afghan-led national dialogue, in which all Afghans can be involved. We recognize the need for conveying unified messages to the Taliban in coordination with other international partners.
56. We reiterate our clear determination that Iran must never develop a nuclear weapon. We remain deeply concerned about Iran's unabated escalation of its nuclear program, which has no credible civilian justification and brings it dangerously close to actual weapon-related activities. A diplomatic solution remains the best way to resolve this issue. In that context, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action continues to provide a useful reference. We call on Iran to take prompt and concrete actions to fulfill its legal obligations and political commitments, including nuclear non-proliferation and safeguards obligations. We reiterate our profound concern over Iran's systemic human rights violations and abuses, including its repression of popular feminist protest as well as the targeting of individuals, including women, girls, minority groups, and journalists, in and outside of Iran. We call on Iran's leadership to end all unjust and arbitrary detentions.
57. We express our grave concern regarding Iran's continued destabilizing activities, including the transfer of missiles, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and related technologies to state and non-state actors and proxy groups, in breach of UNSCRs including 2231 and 2216. Iran must stop supporting Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine. In particular, we call upon Iran to cease transferring armed UAVs, which have been used to attack Ukraine's critical infrastructure and kill Ukrainian civilians. We welcome initiatives to improve bilateral relations and de-escalate tensions in the region, including Iran and Saudi Arabia's recent agreement to restore ties. We emphasize the importance of ensuring maritime security in the Middle East's waterways and call on Iran not to interfere with the lawful exercise of navigational rights and freedoms by all vessels.
58. We call on Israelis and Palestinians to take steps to build trust toward the realization of a two-state solution. To this end, all parties must refrain from unilateral actions, including settlement activities and incitement to violence. We reiterate our support for the historic status quo in Jerusalem. We welcome the recent meetings between Egypt, Israel, Jordan, the Palestinian Authority, and the United States and hope their commitments will be fulfilled in good faith. We will continue our support for Palestinian economic self-reliance and the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East.
59. We remain firmly committed to an inclusive, UN-facilitated political process consistent with UNSCR 2254 in Syria. We reaffirm that the international community should only consider normalization and reconstruction assistance once there is authentic and enduring progress towards a political solution. We express our continued support for the work of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) and are committed to accountability for those responsible for the use of chemical weapons and violations of international law, including international humanitarian law and international human rights law, as applicable. We call for full and unhindered humanitarian access to all Syrians in need, particularly through UN cross-border aid for which there is no alternative in scope or scale. We remain committed to the enduring defeat of ISIS, including durable solutions for ISIS detainees and displaced persons remaining in Northeast Syria.
60. We further express our support to preserve stability and prosperity in other parts of the Middle East and North Africa. Regarding Yemen, we call on all parties to secure a durable ceasefire and work towards a comprehensive, durable, and inclusive Yemeni-led political process under UN auspices. We encourage the Tunisian government to meet the democratic aspiration of its people, to address its economic situation and to reach an agreement with the IMF. We also support efforts to achieve stability and unity in Libya under the auspice of the UN in coordination with the African Union and the Arab League. We urge all Libyan stakeholders to work constructively on the political process in order to hold free, fair, and inclusive presidential and parliamentary elections by the end of 2023.
61. We reaffirm our engagement with Central Asian countries to address various regional challenges, including the consequences of Russia's war of aggression, the destabilizing effect of the situation in Afghanistan, food and energy security, terrorism, and climate change. We are determined to foster trade and energy links, sustainable connectivity and transportation, including the ""Middle Corridor"" and associated projects to enhance regional prosperity and resilience.
62. We are deepening our partnerships with African countries and regional organizations, including the African Union. We have each expressed support to African calls for stronger representation in international fora, notably the G20. We reiterate our strong commitment to supporting governments in the region to address, in a manner consistent with international law, the underlying conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism, violent extremism, and instability across Africa. We are seriously concerned about the growing presence of the Russia-affiliated Wagner Group forces on the continent and their destabilizing impact and human rights abuses. Keeping in mind the situations in West Africa and the Sahel, the Horn of Africa, and the Great Lakes regions, we will work together to support African-led efforts on peace, stability and prosperity on the continent. In this regard, we welcome the positive developments stemming from the cessation of hostilities agreement between the Government of Ethiopia and the Tigray People's Liberation Front, and call on both parties to remain committed to full implementation. We also call for international support for the Somali President's reform priorities and the fight against al-Shabaab. We reaffirm our commitment to the sovereignty, independence, unity, and territorial integrity of the Democratic Republic of Congo. We welcome the cessation of hostilities agreed in March and call for its full implementation. We condemn the advance of the UN-sanctioned March 23 Movement armed group (M23) and join African leaders in calling for M23 to withdraw unconditionally from all territories it controls. We are also seriously concerned about the spread of terrorist threats and activities towards coastal countries in West Africa, and are available to lend our support in addressing those threats.
63. We strongly condemn the ongoing fighting between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces. This threatens the security and safety of civilians, undermines efforts to restore Sudan's democratic transition, and could affect the stability of the region. We urge the parties to end hostilities immediately without pre-conditions and return civilian-led democratic government. We call on all actors to renounce violence and take active steps to reduce tensions, and ensure the safety of all civilians, including humanitarian personnel. The parties to the conflict must uphold their obligations under international humanitarian law, ensure the safety of all civilians, including humanitarian personnel, and not impede or restrict the delivery of life-saving aid. We commend the bravery and fortitude of humanitarian agencies working in Sudan. We acknowledge the generosity of Sudan's neighbors who, despite facing significant humanitarian challenges of their own, host a growing number of Sudanese refugees. We commit to supporting response operations in Sudan and across East and North Africa and the Sahel region for refugees and returnees.
64. We highlight the importance of enhancing cooperation with countries in Latin America and the Caribbean to uphold shared interests as well as values. We are committed to working with regional partners to address economic challenges, climate change, biodiversity loss, natural disasters, and other global issues. We reiterate our commitment to strengthen coordination with Latin American and Caribbean partners and other actors to promote the rule of law, respect for human rights, and meet the elevated humanitarian and security needs in the region, especially in Venezuela, Haiti, and Nicaragua. With respect to the ongoing crisis in Haiti, we underscore the importance of working towards Haitian-led solution for a return to stability and need to hold accountable those who cultivate violence, corruption and instability.
65. We welcome the Agreement on the path to normalization of relations between Kosovo and Serbia and its Implementation Annex, reached under the EU facilitated dialogue in Brussels on February 27 and in Ohrid on March 18 respectively. In order to unlock its full potential for the citizens of Kosovo and Serbia and for advancing good-neighbourly relations in the Western Balkans, we call on both parties to implement expediently and in good faith their respective obligations.
Conclusion 
66. We appreciate the exchanges with and the inputs from the G7 Engagement Groups. We are furthermore grateful for the valuable contributions from the Heads of the IEA, the IMF, the OECD, the UN, the WB, the WHO and the WTO who joined us in Hiroshima.

Joe Biden,"May 20, 2023",Joint Statement—Hiroshima Action Statement for Resilient Global Food Security,"We, the leaders of Japan, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Comoros, the Cook Islands, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, the Republic of Korea, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, Viet Nam and the European Union, reaffirmed that access to affordable, safe and nutritious food is a basic human need, and shared the importance of working closely together to respond to the worsening global food security crisis with the world facing highest risk of famine in a generation and to build more resilient, sustainable and inclusive agriculture and food systems, including through enhancing stability and predictability in international markets. Noting the key actions outlined in the United Nations Food Systems Summit 2021 (UNFSS) and the 2022 Global Food Security Roadmap endorsed by over 100 country signatories as well as the G20's efforts on global food security, we intend to jointly take the following actions in cooperation with the international community to strengthen global food security and nutrition and call on other partners to join us in these efforts.
1. Responding to the immediate food security crisis 
Global food security is threatened by multiple factors and risks such as the COVID-19 pandemic, volatile energy, food and fertilizer prices, the serious impact of climate change and armed conflicts, with disproportionate impacts on the most vulnerable, including women, children and persons with disabilities. The war in Ukraine has further aggravated the ongoing food security crisis around the world, especially in developing and least developed countries. We note with deep concern the adverse impact of the war in Ukraine and stress that it is causing immense human suffering and exacerbating existing fragilities in the global economy—constraining growth, increasing inflation, disrupting supply chains, heightening energy and food insecurity, and elevating financial stability risks. Especially in light of its impact on food security and the humanitarian situation around the world, we support a just and durable peace based on respect for international law, principles of the UN charter and territorial integrity and sovereignty. We call on all participants of the Black Sea Grain Initiative (BSGI) to continue and fully implement its smooth operation at its maximum potential and for as long as necessary, and stress the importance of allowing grains to continue to reach those most in need. According to UN and relevant reports, up to 828 million people were facing hunger across the world in 2021 and 258 million people in 58 food crisis countries, especially in developing and least developed countries, were estimated to need emergency food assistance in 2022. We will be working together to respond to the immediate food security crisis including through:
Supporting multisectoral humanitarian assistance to countries experiencing crisis and emergency levels of acute food insecurity, such as in the Horn of Africa.
Advocating for a substantial increase in humanitarian and development funding, including from other international donors and private sector partners to fill emergency and critical development assistance funding gaps to avert famine and build sustainable and resilient food systems.
Supporting grain exports from Ukraine and Russia including the expansion and extension of the BSGI, continuation of the EU ""Solidarity Lanes"" and the restoration of the agricultural sector in Ukraine as well as supporting any UN efforts to identify and evidence illegal movement of grains.
Facilitating rules-based, open, fair, transparent and non-discriminatory international trade in food and agricultural products, to stabilize markets by reducing the risk of scarcity and mitigating price volatility.
Strengthening coordination among donors, the UN including the Rome-Based Agencies of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the World Food Progamme (WFP) and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), International Financial Institutions (IFIs) and Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs), including through the Global Alliance for Food Security (GAFS), the Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC) and the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP), to prioritize and cover the most urgent needs, to avoid further deterioration of humanitarian conditions and to accelerate responsible investments in food systems.
Supporting immediate assistance to scale up sustainable and efficient local, regional and international food production and value chains consistent with World Trade Organization (WTO) rules.
2. Preparing for and preventing future food security crises 
We recognize the importance of enhancing market transparency, minimizing distortions that are inconsistent with WTO rules, enhancing the availability of accurate information and analysis as key aspects of preventing or minimizing the risk of food security crises and malnutrition and facilitating early actions in cases of crises. We also recognize the importance of developing a shared understanding of recommended actions in response to food security crises. Therefore, we intend to cooperate towards the following purposes:

(2) To develop a shared understanding of recommended crisis-time actions
Welcoming and supporting the dialogue on the food security crisis between food exporting countries and importing countries to be co-hosted by the IGC and Japan under its G7 Presidency in June.
Contributing to the identification and the development of guiding principles and best practices related to trade and market transparency in crisis response based on this dialogue.
Reconfirming that agricultural trade must be rules-based, open, fair, transparent, predictable, inclusive, non-discriminatory and consistent with WTO rules, and recalling the WTO Ministerial Decision on WFP Food Purchases Exemption from Export Prohibitions or Restrictions as well as the WTO Ministerial Declaration on the Emergency Response to Food Insecurity.
Calling for more concrete actions to address measures that impact global food security by seeking meaningful outcomes on the issues in the 13th WTO Ministerial Conference (MC13) negotiations.
Promoting donor coordination on food crises responses including emergency humanitarian assistance and mitigating measures for most affected populations through mechanism such as GAFS and GNAFC.
Focusing on expanding fertilizer efficiency and soil health practices.
3. Realizing resilient global food security and nutrition for all 
Realizing resilient global food security and nutrition for all is our shared goal for a better future for each human being. We are committed to working together to pave the way to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030, progressively realizing of the right to adequate food and building resilient, sustainable, efficient and inclusive food systems, and enabling those in need to access affordable, safe and nutritious food and healthy diets now and into the future. We also emphasize the importance of climate change adaptation and mitigation in agriculture and food systems, of halting and reversing biodiversity loss while recognizing the strong interrelation between agriculture and biodiversity, preventing all forms of malnutrition, and reducing food loss and waste, as well as utilizing traditional knowledge and promoting gender-responsive approaches that engage women as key actors of food systems whereas women and girls are often disproportionately affected by food insecurity and malnutrition.

Joe Biden,"May 20, 2023",Joint Statement by President Biden and Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of Australia—An Alliance for Our Times,"We, Prime Minister Albanese and President Biden, meet at a uniquely consequential time for our Alliance, the Indo-Pacific, and the world.
Our partnership reflects more than one hundred years of trust, respect, friendship and shared sacrifice. Our relationship is founded on a shared commitment to supporting an open, stable and prosperous Indo-Pacific, and a peaceful, inclusive and rules-based international order based on respect for international law and the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states. It is anchored in shared values of democracy, the rule of law, and the protection and promotion of human rights.
Today we renew these bonds as we enhance the Alliance to respond to evolving challenges.
Addressing Climate and Biodiversity Action, and Clean Energy Transition 
Today we have signed a statement of intent to advance our climate cooperation through the Australia-United States Climate, Critical Minerals, and Clean Energy Transformation Compact. We are taking urgent action to elevate global climate ambition, accelerate the global clean energy transition, and support mitigation, adaptation and resilience efforts in the Indo-Pacific and beyond. The Compact affirms the position of climate and clean energy as the third pillar of the Alliance, alongside our defence and economic cooperation.
Under the Compact, Australia and the United States intend for our private sectors, resources, and industrial strength to drive innovation and accelerate the establishment of a responsible, secure, and inclusive global clean energy economy. We intend to coordinate to spur the diversification and expansion of clean energy supply chains, address the growing energy demands of the Indo-Pacific, and enhance the Indo-Pacific's role as a primary driver of global prosperity. The newly-established Australia-U.S. Forum on Clean Energy Industrial Transformation and Taskforce on Critical Minerals will allow both our countries to deepen cooperation to deliver sustainable, resilient, and secure critical minerals and clean energy to the world and reduce emissions.
Our countries are committed to halting and reversing environmental degradation, including via environmental economic accounting and reporting, nature-based solutions, preventing pollution, and protecting and restoring biodiversity on both land and in water. The United States applauds Australia in creating Environment Protection Australia, its national environment protection agency, and plans to support efforts to share information and best practices through a forthcoming memorandum of understanding between our environmental agencies.
The United States and Australia share a proud tradition of working together to improve ocean health and using science for sustainable development and conservation of the ocean. This collaboration is being enhanced through a new arrangement to advance Pacific Ocean exploration and mapping between the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Geoscience Australia, and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. These three leading science agencies are working together in consultation with Pacific islands countries to conduct new hydrographic mapping activities, provide technical exchange and expertise of ocean characterisation, and conduct joint exploration expeditions and campaigns across the Pacific to accelerate our understanding of the ocean to advance climate solutions, the new blue economy, and stewardship priorities.
Building our Defence Capability 
We welcome the progress being made to provide Australia with a conventionally-armed, nuclear-powered submarine capability, and on developing advanced capabilities under the trilateral AUKUS partnership to deter aggression and sustain peace and stability across the Indo-Pacific. We are prioritising improving information sharing and technology cooperation mechanisms required to advance our defence and security collaboration, including through AUKUS.
The President plans to ask the United States Congress to add Australia as a ""domestic source"" within the meaning of Title III of the Defense Production Act. Doing so would streamline technological and industrial base collaboration, accelerate and strengthen AUKUS implementation, and build new opportunities for United States investment in the production and purchase of Australian critical minerals, critical technologies, and other strategic sectors.
We also acknowledge the work under way to implement Australia-United States Enhanced Force Posture Cooperation, including accelerating Japan's involvement in force posture related activities.
Harnessing Emerging Technologies 
Australia and the United States stand ready to seize the opportunities of quantum and advanced technologies, building upon our Joint Statement of Collaboration on Quantum, signed in November 2021, and the release of Australia's National Quantum Strategy. We are determined to deepen cooperation on initiatives to be delivered in the coming year, and to work bilaterally and with partners to drive innovation and responsible norms and standards for emerging technologies as we lead the quantum revolution.
The United States also appreciates the collaboration with Australian counterparts on promoting telecommunications supplier diversity, including Open Radio Access Networks (Open RAN), given its strong potential to advance resilience, competitiveness, and diversity priorities shared by many bilateral and multilateral partners with regard to telecoms network infrastructure.
We acknowledge the importance of facilitating the free flow of data across borders through an open, global, interoperable, reliable, and secure Internet and reiterate our shared commitment to participating in multilateral fora such as the Global Cross-Border Privacy Rules Forum, which was established to support the free flow of data and effective data protection and privacy globally.
Reaching New Frontiers in Space 
Space collaboration is a rich opportunity to build high-skilled, well-paying jobs and increase investment between our countries. Australia and the United States have reached agreement in principle, subject to final domestic authorisations, on the Technology Safeguards Agreement, to allow for the controlled transfer of sensitive US launch technology and data while protecting US technology consistent with US non-proliferation policy, the Missile Technology Control Regime and US export controls.
As founding signatories to the Artemis Accords, and building on more than 60 years of cooperation in lunar exploration, we intend to establish a new Australia-based ground station supporting NASA's Artemis program that will provide near-continuous communications support to lunar missions.
Securing Peace and Future Prosperity 
We are committed to upholding a global order based on international law, including the fundamental principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity. We condemn in the strongest possible terms Russia's illegal and immoral invasion of Ukraine. Russia's war violates international law, including the UN Charter, and is driving global food and energy insecurity— the effects of which are reverberating in the Indo-Pacific region. We once again call on Russia to immediately, completely, and unconditionally withdraw its forces from within the internationally recognised borders of Ukraine. As part of our continuing, coordinated actions to impose costs on Russia for its appalling actions in Ukraine, Australia and the United States both imposed a further tranche of sanctions and trade measures on Russian entities and individuals on 19 May whilst at the G7 Summit.
We reiterate our commitment to the global non-proliferation regime, including the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, as the cornerstone of the non-proliferation and disarmament regime. We reaffirmed our commitment towards the ultimate goal of a world without nuclear weapons.
Both leaders applauded Japan's hosting of the G7 Summit in Hiroshima, and its contribution to promoting an inclusive and rules-based international order.
The Quad Leaders' Summit in Hiroshima will demonstrate the Quad's enduring contribution to the development, stability, and prosperity of the Indo-Pacific through its positive, practical agenda. We look forward to the next Quad Leaders' Summit being held in India. We strongly support India's G20 presidency under the theme of 'One Earth, One Family, One Future' and its overarching focus on sustainable development, in addressing the most pressing global challenges together.
We are working through the Pacific Islands Forum and other long-standing Pacific regional institutions to listen to and partner with the countries of the Pacific to meet the region's needs. We intend to pursue joint financing to help modernise and secure infrastructure in the region, including by working with regional organisations and mechanisms like the Pacific Region Infrastructure Facility and other initiatives such as the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment that promote and maintain high standards, including on labour and environmental practices. Australia welcomes the US commitment to explore new grant funding for infrastructure projects in the Pacific, and its intent to further develop sovereign financing capacity to meet critical infrastructure needs in the Pacific. Australia welcomes the US commitment through USAID to pre-position disaster response stores with Australia's managed supplies in Brisbane and Papua New Guinea to improve response times.
The United States Coast Guard plans to deploy a US Coast Guard Cutter to the Pacific in early 2024, to provide an enduring humanitarian presence in the region, complementary to Australia's Pacific Support Vessel. We welcome the growing partnership between the United States Coast Guard, the Australian Defence Force, and Australian Border Force with Pacific partners to enhance the maritime security of the Blue Pacific and address the challenge of illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing. This includes through the delivery of training coordinated with Australia's Pacific Maritime Security Program. We are committed to exploring options to support enhanced US Coast Guard engagement in the region, including logistics.
We reiterate our enduring commitment to deepen our respective engagement with Southeast Asia. As Comprehensive Strategic Partners of ASEAN, we reaffirm our commitment to ASEAN centrality and ASEAN-led regional architecture. We express our strong support for Indonesia's priorities as the 2023 ASEAN Chair, including its leadership of the East Asia Summit in Jakarta this year. We look forward to furthering trilateral cooperation with regional partners, including both Japan and the Philippines.
We emphasise the importance of all states being able to exercise rights and freedoms in a manner consistent with international law as reflected in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, including freedom of navigation and overflight. We strongly oppose destabilising actions in the South China Sea, such as the militarisation of disputed features, the dangerous use of coast guard vessels and maritime militia, and efforts to disrupt other countries' offshore resource exploitation. We are also concerned about the People's Republic of China's excessive maritime claims that are inconsistent with international law and unilateral actions that may raise tensions in the region. We resolve to work with partners to support regional maritime security and uphold international law.
We reaffirm the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and our shared opposition to unilateral changes to the status quo. We call for the peaceful resolution of cross-strait issues through dialogue without the threat or use of force or coercion.
Building Cyber Capacity and Protecting Children Online 
The United States and Australia recognise the importance of supporting the Pacific to adopt and adapt to new digital technologies, and to manage the risks that accompany these, in order to ensure a more peaceful, prosperous, and resilient region. We commit to working together on cyber security capacity building objectives, approaches, and policies in the Pacific, and to listen to Pacific partner countries' priorities to inform future cooperation.
Online child sexual exploitation and abuse is increasingly prevalent, commodified, organised, and worsened by the speed, scale, and scope of digital technologies. We are steadfast in combatting all forms of child exploitation and abuse in our communities, online and internationally. For this reason, we have decided to take steps to establish the Australia-United States Joint Council on Combatting Online Child Sexual Exploitation. The Council will develop and facilitate the implementation of a joint, multidisciplinary work plan which includes cooperation in the Indo-Pacific; driving a trauma-informed and victim and survivor-centred approach; research and development; operational opportunities; policy and legislation; prevention, awareness, and outreach; and Safety by Design.
Fostering Free and Fair Trade and Strengthening Economic Resilience 
We are committed to the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the shared values upon which it is based, including fair competition, openness, transparency and the rule of law. We intend to work together to improve the system through reform, including so that it can better achieve the WTO's foundational objectives and help address global challenges. We reaffirm the commitment of Ministers at the Twelfth Session of the WTO Ministerial Conference to work towards necessary reform of the WTO to improve all of its functions, including to conduct discussions with the view to having a fully- and well-functioning dispute settlement system accessible to all members by 2024.
We also plan to work with the Pacific to help maintain access to enduring banking services, including correspondent banking relationships which are vital to facilitate trade, remittances, and investment.
We reaffirm our ongoing efforts to strengthen our shared economic security, including via the Australia-United States Strategic Commercial Dialogue, which will convene in Detroit later this week. We look forward to seeing one another again in San Francisco this November for the APEC Economic Leaders' Week, to advance sustainable and inclusive economic growth in the region. We also look forward to working together to deliver tangible benefits under the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity by the end of this year.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/joint-statement-president-biden-and-prime-minister-anthony-albanese-australia-alliance-for
Joe Biden,"May 20, 2023",Joint Statement by Group of Seven (G-7) Nations Leaders on Economic Resilience and Economic Security,"Fostering mutually beneficial partnerships and supporting resilient and sustainable value chains remains our priority to reduce risk both for our economies, as well as globally, and ensure sustainable development for all. Recent events have highlighted vulnerabilities in economies around the world to natural disasters, pandemics, geopolitical tensions and coercion. Recalling our commitment from the 2022 G7 Elmau Summit, we are taking additional steps today to enhance our ongoing strategic coordination on economic resilience and economic security by reducing vulnerabilities and countering malign practices that exploit and reinforce them. This complements the corresponding steps we are taking to enhance supply chain resilience as laid out in the G7 Clean Energy Economy Action Plan. We underline the importance of cooperating both within the G7 as well as with all our partners to enhance global economic resilience, including by supporting a more significant role for low and middle-income countries in supply chains in a way that also promotes their diversification and local value creation and benefits local workers and communities everywhere. We will address non-market policies and practices designed to reinforce dependencies, and will counter economic coercion. We will continue to ensure that the clearly defined, narrow set of sensitive technologies that are crucial for national security or could threaten international peace and security are appropriately controlled, without unduly impacting broader trade in technology. We affirm that our cooperation to strengthen economic resilience and economic security will be rooted in maintaining and improving a well-functioning international rules-based system, in particular the multilateral trading system with the WTO at its core. To these ends, we will work and coordinate through the G7 framework to make year-on-year progress in a holistic manner.
Enhancing global economic resilience
Building resilient supply chains 
The COVID-19 pandemic and Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine has laid bare vulnerabilities in supply chains in countries around the world. Supply chain disruptions have had devastating impact for developing, emerging, and advanced economies alike. We recognize that transparency, diversification, security, sustainability, and trustworthiness and reliability are essential principles on which to build and strengthen resilient supply-chain networks among trusted partner countries both within and outside the G7. We encourage all nations to support these principles on resilient and reliable supply chains. We reaffirm our strong will to support the wider international community, particularly developing countries, in building their resilience, including through implementing the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment. Our partnerships honor international law, are free and fair, and foster mutually beneficial economic and trade relationships. Drawing lessons from recent incidents of weaponizing energy and other economic dependencies, we stand firmly against such behavior. We will enhance resilient supply chains through partnerships around the world, especially for critical goods such as critical minerals, semiconductors and batteries. We will step up our efforts to strengthen channels of communication to address supply disruptions and share insights and best practices, including from respective scenario-based stress testing.
Building resilient critical infrastructure
We emphasize the importance of cooperating on enhancing security and resiliency in critical infrastructure particularly in the digital domain. We welcome projects that strengthen the resilience of the ICT ecosystem including mobile, satellite and core networks, submarine cables, components and cloud infrastructure. We support an innovative and competitive digital ecosystem of trustworthy vendors, welcome supplier diversification efforts, and continue to discuss market trends towards open, interoperable approaches, alongside secure, resilient and established architectures in a technology neutral way. Under the Japanese G7 Presidency and against the background of early deployments of Open RAN, we will continue to exchange views on open architectures and security-related aspects and opportunities. We support open, global, market-driven, and inclusive multi-stakeholder approaches for the development of technical standards for telecommunications equipment and services to enable openness and interoperability in a technology neutral way. We discussed that such infrastructure requires a rigorous evaluation of equipment, consistent with existing measures such as those outlined in the Prague Proposals, and the EU's 5G toolbox. We reaffirm the need to assess political, economic, and other risks of a non-technical nature posed by vendors and suppliers. We will continue our work to build resilient critical infrastructure by sharing information and best practices gained through our respective efforts.
Responding to harmful practices that undermine international rules and norms
Responding to non-market policies and practices to secure global economic resilience 
We express renewed concerns about comprehensive strategies to use a range of non-market policies and practices such as pervasive, opaque, and harmful industrial subsidies, market distortive practices of state owned enterprises, and all forms of forced technology transfers, as well as other practices to create strategic dependencies and systemic vulnerabilities. Addressing non-market policies and practices can therefore be an integral aspect in enhancing economic resilience and thereby economic security. In light of increased use of non-market policies and practices to reinforce vulnerabilities, we reaffirm the need to make effective use of existing means while developing new tools as appropriate. We will continue to actively develop stronger international rules and norms to tackle non-market policies and practices that distort the level playing field, and strengthen efforts at the WTO to better address these issues.
Addressing economic coercion 
The world has encountered a disturbing rise in incidents of economic coercion that seek to exploit economic vulnerabilities and dependencies and undermine the foreign and domestic policies and positions of G7 members as well as partners around the world. We will work together to ensure that attempts to weaponize economic dependencies by forcing G7 members and our partners including small economies to comply and conform will fail and face consequences. We express serious concern over economic coercion and call on all countries to refrain from its use, which not only undermines the functioning of and trust in the multilateral trading system, but also infringes upon the international order centered on respect for sovereignty and the rule of law, and ultimately undermines global security and stability. At our respective domestic levels, we will use our existing tools, review their effectiveness and develop new ones as needed to deter and counter the use of coercive economic measures. Recognizing the importance of existing joint efforts including at the WTO, we will enhance collaboration by launching the Coordination Platform on Economic Coercion to increase our collective assessment, preparedness, deterrence and response to economic coercion, and further promote cooperation with partners beyond the G7. Within this Coordination Platform, we will use early warning and rapid information sharing, regularly consult each other, collaboratively assess situations, explore coordinated responses, deter and, where appropriate, counter economic coercion, in accordance with our respective legal systems. We will also coordinate, as appropriate, to support targeted states, economies and entities as a demonstration of solidarity and resolve to uphold the rule of law.
Countering harmful practices in the digital sphere 
We express concern about regulations that unjustifiably require companies to localize data or those that allow governments to access data without appropriate safeguards and protections. As a result of geopolitical and geo-economic upheavals, global business value and supply chains, especially those of our critical infrastructure, are exposed to risks. We will therefore deepen our strategic dialogue to seek to counter malicious practices in the digital sphere to protect global value and supply chains from illegitimate influence, espionage, illicit knowledge leakage, and sabotage.
Cooperating on international standards setting 
We recognize the importance of technical standards in the global economy and reaffirm our commitment to collectively support the development of open, voluntary and consensus-based standards that will shape the next generation of technology. These should be based on inclusive multi-stakeholder approaches in line with our common democratic values and principles. Reflecting on shared values and principles, we will identify and address issues related to international standards setting, where they arise, through information sharing and engagement in the established standards setting processes. We will deepen our cooperation through information sharing including with wider public and private stakeholders in international standards setting activities, and support effective standards setting. To this end, we reaffirm our continued collaboration including through the Framework for G7 Collaboration on Digital Technical Standards.
Addressing shared concerns regarding threats to international peace and security
Protecting international peace and security by preventing leakage of critical and emerging technologies 
As we deepen research and development among G7 partners on critical and emerging technologies, we affirm our shared responsibility and determination to coordinate on preventing the cutting-edge technologies we develop from being used to further military capabilities that threaten international peace and security. To that end, we will share, as appropriate, information and experiences to further develop common understanding of such risks and the policy tools needed to address them, and take further actions where necessary, including those related to export and investment, corresponding to the circumstances of each country. We will further strengthen multilateral efforts to cooperate in the field of export controls to ensure gaps in our dual use technology protection ecosystem cannot be exploited. We have a common interest in preventing the narrow set of technological advances that are assessed to be core to enhancing the military and intelligence capabilities of actors who may use these capabilities to undermine international peace and security, from being fueled by our companies' capital, expertise, and knowledge. We recognize that appropriate measures designed to address risks from outbound investment could be important to complement existing tools of targeted controls on exports and inbound investments, which work together to protect our sensitive technologies from being used in ways that threaten international peace and security. As we continue to work to make our economic security toolkits fit for today's challenges, we will provide clarity to the private sector regarding these common goals. We will also continue to coordinate, share lessons, and seek to align our approaches where feasible to maximize the effectiveness of our efforts.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/joint-statement-group-seven-g-7-nations-leaders-economic-resilience-and-economic-security
Joe Biden,"June 08, 2023",Joint Statement—The Atlantic Declaration: A Framework for a Twenty-First Century United States-United Kingdom Economic Partnership,"Today the United States and the United Kingdom are announcing the Atlantic Declaration for a Twenty-First Century U.S.-UK Economic Partnership to ensure that our unique alliance is adapted, reinforced, and reimagined for the challenges of this moment.
Over the last century, the essential partnership between the United States and the United Kingdom has enabled us to lead together on issues of global importance. Since the signing of the Atlantic Charter in 1941, we have worked together to shape an open and rules-based international order based on our enduring support for shared values. In the New Atlantic Charter signed in 2021, we underscored and refreshed this vision. Together, we also designed an international economic architecture that has underpinned our economic strength and helped to lift millions around the world out of poverty. Our essential bilateral relationship is underpinned by the closest cooperation on defense and security, a thriving economic relationship, leadership in science and technology, and deep ties between our people and civil societies.
U.S.-UK cooperation and joint leadership is as essential today as ever—both internationally and for the security and prosperity of our people at home. To achieve this, we must keep pace with changes in the world around us and adapt our alliance to them. The global economy is undergoing one of the greatest transformations since the Industrial Revolution. Breakthroughs in innovation offer enormous potential if we can harness them to work for, not against, our democracies and security. The transition to the clean energy economies of the future is an opportunity to improve jobs and livelihoods and deepen the resilience of our economies. At the same time, the nature of national security is changing. Technology, economics, and national security are more deeply intertwined than ever before. We face new challenges to international stability—from authoritarian states such as Russia and the People's Republic of China (PRC); disruptive technologies; non-state actors; and transnational challenges like climate change.
Over the past year, we have taken steps to deepen our unrivalled defense, security, and intelligence relationship across every theater in the globe in which we cooperate, recognizing the indivisibility of security in the Euro-Atlantic and the Indo-Pacific and other regions. We have energized our traditional alliances and built new and innovative partnerships based on deeper cooperation on technology, trade, and security. We have stood shoulder to shoulder in our resolve to support Ukraine for as long as it takes in the face of Russia's illegal, unjustifiable, and unprovoked war of aggression and to preserve a free, independent, and sovereign Ukraine. We are committed to continuing to strengthen NATO's ability to deter further attempts to undermine Alliance security, in support of NATO's new Strategic Concept.
We have taken significant steps to implement AUKUS, including announcing our plans to support Australia acquiring conventionally armed, nuclear-powered submarines. Through our deeper engagement in the Indo-Pacific we are working more closely than ever before with our partners to support a free and open region. Through the U.S.-UK Indo-Pacific Dialogue we will continue to find new opportunities to coordinate our approaches, to support ASEAN and ASEAN centrality, to partner with the Pacific Islands, to coordinate on economic and technological advancement, and to contribute to regional peace and stability, including through AUKUS and expanded joint exercises and planning, including trilaterally.
Today, we are announcing the Atlantic Declaration for a Twenty-First Century U.S.-UK Economic Partnership to build on that partnership in the economic sphere. The United States and the United Kingdom resolve to partner to build resilient, diversified, and secure supply chains and reduce strategic dependencies. We remain committed to continuing to lead in the technologies of the future and advance the closest possible coordination on our economic security and technology protection toolkits to ensure that emerging technologies work for, not against, our democracies and security. And as democratic and open societies we resolve to work together to ensure the safety, prosperity, and security of our nations and peoples while driving growth in living standards across the world.
The Atlantic Declaration and accompanying Action Plan form the basis of a new type of innovative partnership across the full spectrum of our economic, technological, commercial and trade relations; a first of its kind that has never been tried before, and which demands our joint leadership and imagination to realize in full.
It will constitute a new economic security framework covering ever-closer cooperation on critical and emerging technologies and stronger protective toolkits. It will support the United States and the United Kingdom in our efforts to harness the energy transition and technological breakthroughs to drive broadly shared growth, create good jobs, and leave no community behind. It will explore ways to deepen our trade and investment relationship. And it will strengthen our alliance across defense, science, health security, and space—allowing us to explore increased cooperation in other areas for mutual economic benefit.
These are the pressing economic issues of our time. These are the issues that demand the United States and the United Kingdom to lead together.
Action Plan for a Twenty-First Century U.S.-UK Economic Partnership (ADAPT) 
Deep economic ties between the United States and the United Kingdom have long been a source of mutual strength. The U.S.-UK bilateral investment relationship is the largest in the world, with over $1.5 trillion in stock [£1.2 trillion] supporting more than 2.7 million jobs in both countries. As we evolve our unparalleled economic relationship to reflect today's challenges, we have an opportunity to exemplify what a twenty-first century economic partnership should look like. Together the United States and the United Kingdom can lead in building a new form of economic partnership that advances economic growth and competitiveness, that builds capacity, resilience, and inclusiveness, and works for our workers and communities. A partnership that works for our hard-working businesses, works for our climate, and works for our national security.
As the first steps in this new partnership, we are today announcing and taking concrete and coordinated actions to deepen this partnership across five pillars, by:
ensuring U.S.-UK leadership in critical and emerging technologies,
advancing ever-closer cooperation on our economic security and technology protection toolkits and supply chains,
partnering on an inclusive and responsible digital transformation,
building the clean energy economy of the future, and
further strengthening our alliance across defense, health security, and space.
Senior White House and Downing Street representatives will convene biannually under the Atlantic Declaration Action Plan (ADAPT) to develop and drive forward concrete progress across the Atlantic Declaration Action Plan and ensure increasing ambition over the next months and years.
1. Ensuring U.S.-UK Leadership in Critical and Emerging Technologies
A handful of critical and emerging technologies are forming the backbone of new industries and shaping our national security landscape. These technologies include semiconductors, quantum technologies, artificial intelligence, cutting-edge telecommunications, and synthetic biology. As the home of world-leading companies and academic institutions, we are committed to ensuring the United States and the United Kingdom continue to lead across these sectors. We intend to do so by collaborating on tangible research and development joint efforts, deepening public-private dialogue across our priority technologies, jointly mobilizing private capital towards strategic technologies and by improving reciprocal talent flows. These long term initiatives are the initial steps in a long-term partnership and will fall under existing U.S.-UK frameworks, including the U.S.-UK Agreement on Scientific and Technological Cooperation, the U.S.-UK Comprehensive Dialogue on Technology and Data, and additional forums as applicable, through which we will develop and deliver a shared workplan on critical and emerging technologies, to be updated and taken forward within the next twelve months.
Launching collaborative work on priority technologies. We intend to explore joint efforts and collaborative R&D in a range of critical and emerging technologies and pursue a set of initial activities, including the following: 
Pursuing a range of quantum technologies initiatives to address fundamental research questions in quantum science and other initiatives to reduce barriers to U.S.-UK collaboration, such as increasing researcher and student mobility, and exploring workforce development activities to foster the exchange of people and ideas. 
Cementing leadership by the United States and the United Kingdom in cutting-edge telecoms by setting out a joint vision, taking forward joint R&D projects, and deepening cooperation on technical activity in innovative 5G and 6G solutions, including more ambitious cooperation to accelerate Open RAN to market, and to increase the diversity and resilience of critical supply chains. 
Deepening cooperation on synthetic biology with a view to concluding a joint workplan to drive public and private cooperation, exchanges, and joint research, developing novel applications and promoting our economic security through improved supply chain pathways for biomanufacturing and biotechnologies. 
Exploring collaborative R&D in areas that support advanced semiconductor technologies, such as advanced materials and compound semiconductors, beginning in the next twelve months, and facilitating collaboration among our national research institutes. 
Accelerating our cooperation on AI with a focus on ensuring the safe and responsible development of the technology. 

Mobilising private capital towards strategic technologies. We intend to support the growth of companies in both countries across these critical and emerging technologies. We intend to work together to crowd in private capital to ensure companies in these areas have the ability to emerge and scale. To this end, we commit to set up a U.S.-UK Strategic Technologies Investor Council within the next twelve months. We will use this newly formed Council to bring leading investors from both sides of the Atlantic together with national security experts to analyze where funding gaps currently exist and unlock new private investment in critical and emerging technologies. 
Facilitating reciprocal talent flows. We recognize the need for a skilled workforce across our technology sectors. As part of meeting this objective, we leverage expertise from across the public sector, industry, and academia to advise on how we best improve U.S.-UK reciprocal talent flows. The United States welcomes funding from the United Kingdom for expansion of Marshall and Fulbright scholarships focused on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics subjects, to deepen the wider exchange of talent between our two countries.
2. Advancing Ever Closer Cooperation on Technology Protection, Economic Security Toolkits and Supply Chains 
Many of our technology protection tools were designed for a different time, a different set of threats, and a different set of technologies. We recognize that our current regulatory frameworks related to export controls, investment screening, sanctions, and research and development security are essential tools that should correspond to a changing geostrategic and technological environment. We intend to take concrete steps to update and more closely align our respective toolkits across all these areas to prevent the leakage of sensitive and dual-use emerging technologies, and other export-controlled commodities and technologies. We will work to enhance our information-sharing mechanisms on threat information with relevant stakeholders in the policy and intelligence communities, including deepening our cooperation on investment security.
Addressing the national security risks posed by certain types of outbound investment. As allies with a close and long-standing defense partnership, and as global leaders in critical and emerging technologies, we have a shared objective in preventing our companies' capital and expertise from fueling technological advances that will enhance the military and intelligence capabilities of countries of concern. We are taking steps to ensure that our respective toolkits are adequate to meet our shared objective. The United States is working to develop a targeted set of controls on outbound investments in sensitive technologies with a core national security nexus. The United Kingdom intends to complement this by swiftly engaging a range of business and financial stakeholders to develop an evidence base to assess and inform how the UK can best calibrate its actions to respond effectively to these risks and meet our shared objective. As we act according to our own respective timelines, we will communicate clearly to the private sector regarding our joint resolve and shared objectives in this area. 
Ensuring flexible and coordinated export controls. Against the backdrop of a rapidly shifting and ever more sophisticated technological landscape, our toolkits must address evolving challenges. We will therefore work together to enable our respective toolkits to work in a complementary way, implementing export controls related to certain sensitive technologies, including targeting end-uses of concern, and considering our approach to tackling the challenge of intangible transfers. The United Kingdom has enhanced its capability in this area by expanding the scope of its Military End Use Controls (MEUC) regime and is progressing work—due to complete by the autumn—to understand its impact. The United Kingdom will consult later this year on updating its export control regime and consider how best to flexibly and rapidly tackle sensitive technology transfers. The United Kingdom will also consult on the targeting of end uses and end-users of concern. Building on our existing cooperation and recognising that the multilateral system faces challenges in accommodating new realities and that creative solutions are necessary, both sides will advance work and bilateral consultations in the coming months to enable deeper collaboration and ensure both our export control systems are able together to tackle the identified threats. 
Strengthening our world-leading partnership across sanctions strategy, design, targeting, implementation and enforcement. We will continue to coordinate our work to tackle sanctions evasion and intend to jointly target those facilitating Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine in Russia, Belarus, and in third countries, including those who help Russia acquire goods and technology that support Russian aggression. We intend to enhance our ability to collect, analyze, and share information and data with a financial sanctions nexus from our financial institutions and businesses, including for identification of companies and individuals financially supporting or facilitating payments to Russia's war machine. We further intend to work closely together to protect humanitarian activity from unintended impacts of sanctions, building on our significant cooperation on the landmark UN Security Council Resolution 2664. We have implemented exceptions for humanitarian activities in our UN programs. The United States has implemented these exceptions in its autonomous sanctions programs, and the United Kingdom will take this further in its autonomous sanctions programs as appropriate. We will also continue joint work to underline that food supplies are not the target of our sanctions. 
Reducing our vulnerabilities across critical technology supply chains. Recent events have shown that our supply chains need to be made more resilient to geopolitical incidents, natural disasters, third country policies, economic coercion, and other possible shocks. The United Kingdom and United States recognize the strategic and shared imperative of building resilient semiconductor and other critical technology supply chains and are putting in place robust strategies to minimize disruptions. In order to further this cooperation, the United States and the United Kingdom will work bilaterally to share analysis, develop, and deepen our channels for coordination and timely consultation during critical technology supply chain disruptions and crises.
3. Partnering on an Inclusive and Responsible Digital Transformation 
As we promote the critical and emerging technology ecosystems in our countries, we will work together to shape the policy environment around technology and enable further responsible innovation.
Enhancing cooperation on data. The trusted and secure flow of data across our borders is foundational to efforts to further innovation. To that end, we have committed in principle to establish a U.S.-UK Data Bridge to facilitate data flows between our countries while ensuring strong and effective privacy protections. We are working to finalize our respective assessments swiftly to implement this framework. We also intend to coordinate to further promote trust in the digital economy, including through support for the Global Cross-Border Privacy Rules (CBPR) Forum and the OECD's Declaration on Government Access to Personal Data Held by Private Sector Entities, and to build shared understandings on data security risks. 
Accelerating cooperation on AI. The United States and the United Kingdom recognize Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform our societies and economies and share a commitment to the role of government action to unlock the opportunities and mitigate the risks arising from the rapid development of these technologies. We will accelerate our cooperation on AI with a focus on ensuring the safe and responsible development of the technology. Both nations welcome ongoing activity internationally including at the OECD, UN, Global Partnership for AI, Council of Europe, and International Standards Organisations, as well as the G7 Hiroshima AI Process, and recognize the need to go further particularly with respect to the risks and opportunities AI presents. The United States welcomes the Prime Minister's plans to launch the first Global Summit on AI Safety, to be hosted in the United Kingdom this year, and commits to attend at a high level. This effort, which fits with the United Kingdom's comprehensive and balanced approach to AI risks and opportunities, will bring together key countries, as well as leading technology companies and researchers, to drive targeted, rapid international action focused on safety and security at the frontier of this technology, including exploring safety measures to evaluate and monitor risks from AI. The United States has taken strong action to promote responsible innovation and is undertaking a process to advance a comprehensive approach to AI-related risk and opportunities, including comprehensive engagement with companies, research, civil society, and our allies and partners. 
Deepening collaboration on Privacy Enhancing Technologies. To maximize the responsible use of data, we intend to launch a Collaboration on Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) that will allow us to gain more valuable insight from data and train responsible AI models, enabling economic and societal benefits, while protecting individuals' privacy and our democratic principles.
4. Building the Clean Energy Economy of the Future 
The United States and the United Kingdom are both committed to meeting our goals under the Paris Agreement, building a clean energy economy, strengthening resilient supply chains, and investing in our industrial bases. We share a belief that building a clean energy economy is one of the most significant opportunities to create good jobs with high labor standards. We affirm that bold investment and strategic public funding are necessary to achieve these goals. We are committed to deepening cooperation to develop and strengthen clean energy supply chains, including building diverse, resilient, and secure critical mineral and battery supply chains that reduce unwanted strategic dependencies to meet our defense, economic, energy security, and climate goals. As we pursue our national strategies, we will work to align our approaches wherever possible to make clean energy technologies more affordable for all nations and help drive a global, just, and secure energy transition for workers and communities that will leave no one behind. We are committed to making the 2020s the decisive decade for climate action, implementing our respective ambitious 2030 nationally determined contributions under the Paris Agreement, and meeting our 2050 net zero emission goals.
Launching negotiations on a Critical Minerals Agreement. With congressional consultation, we intend to immediately begin negotiations on a targeted critical minerals agreement covering the five relevant critical minerals most important for electric vehicles—cobalt, graphite, lithium, manganese, and nickel—that are extracted or processed in the United Kingdom count toward sourcing requirements for clean vehicles eligible for the Section 30D clean vehicle tax credit of the Inflation Reduction Act. We intend to use these focused negotiations to ensure the consistency of our approaches on supply chain diversification and robust labor and environmental standards to support the creation of well-paying jobs with a free and fair choice to join a labor union on both sides of the Atlantic. Through our strong U.S.-UK partnership we will work towards increasing our respective and collective clean energy industrial capacity, boosting electric vehicle production and deployment, and expanding access to sustainable, secure, high-standard critical mineral and battery supply chains. 
Partnering on a Joint Clean Energy Supply Chain Action Plan. Today we are announcing the launch of a one-year Joint Clean Energy Supply Chain Action Plan. Through the U.S.-UK Joint Action Group on Energy Security and Affordability (the JAG), the United States and the United Kingdom will, by the end of 2023, identify and decide on near-term actions our two countries can take in parallel and together to accelerate the buildout of capacity in our countries and third countries sufficient to meet the clean energy demands of the future. We intend to conduct public-private consultations across key clean energy supply chains, including offshore wind and electric vehicle batteries, and conduct rapid stress-test exercises across key clean energy supply chains, which could form a model for future work on supply chain resilience. 
Launching a Civil Nuclear Partnership. Building on our unique economic and security relationship, and recognizing our complementary capabilities, we are launching a civil nuclear partnership overseen by senior officials in both governments. The JAG will also be mobilized to set near-term priorities for joint action to encourage the establishment of new infrastructure and end-to-end fuel cycle capabilities by 2030 in both continents, and substantially minimize reliance on Russian fuel, supplies, and services. Our joint activity and leadership will support and facilitate the safe, secure, and sustainable international deployment of advanced, peaceful nuclear technologies, including small modular reactors, in accordance with the highest non-proliferation standards and consistent with a 1.5 degree Celsius limit on global warming. These priorities will form the basis of a Joint Standing Committee on Nuclear Energy Cooperation (JSCNEC), which is designed to deliver on shared commitments by the end of the year and serve as an enduring bilateral forum to advance shared policy goals across existing engagement mechanisms, including near-term actions identified through the JAG, and facilitate exchanges on new and evolving technical and policy developments regarding nuclear energy.
5. Strengthening our Alliance Across Defense, Health Security, and Space 
We are further strengthening the U.S.-UK alliance in emerging areas with critical nexuses to economic resilience and economic security.
Continuing to optimize our longstanding defense cooperation. We continue to optimize our longstanding defense cooperation and ensure that defense and technology trade and exports between our countries are as frictionless as possible, particularly as part of our efforts to enable collaboration in and between AUKUS nations. To this end, the President plans to ask the United States Congress to add the United Kingdom as a ""domestic source"" within the meaning of Title III of the Defense Production Act. Doing so would deepen industrial base collaboration, accelerate, and strengthen AUKUS implementation, build new opportunities for United States investment in multiple strategic sectors, and support our efforts to increase our respective and collective industrial capacity across both clean energy and key technology sectors. Together the U.S. and the UK are taking steps to streamline defense trade between our nations, including the U.S. proposal to Congress to modernize export control laws to enhance collaboration between and among AUKUS nations. The UK is also examining its export control regime to streamline the flow of defense trade among the AUKUS partners. 
Strengthening bilateral cooperation on biological and health security. Building on the New Atlantic Charter, we commit to strengthening bilateral collaboration between our two nations on biological security, reflecting our shared ambition to bolster future heath and economic resilience against a growing and diverse spectrum of biological threats (deliberate, accidental, or natural), including drug-resistant infections. To this end, we will increase our collaboration to overcome the market failures that prevent vital research and development of anti-microbial vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics—via mechanisms such as the Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria Biopharmaceutical Accelerator (CARB-X). We will enhance our cooperation on tackling emerging infectious disease threats with pandemic or epidemic potential and promote biosafety, biosecurity, and responsible innovation in the biotechnology and life science sectors domestically and internationally to realize the full potential of the growing bioeconomy. We reaffirm our commitment to strengthen global norms against the misuse of biology and prohibitions on the development of biological weapons. 
Looking to the future and deepening our partnership across all sectors of space cooperation. We recognize recent bilateral innovation in commercial space launch and are committed to further strengthening bilateral commercial space cooperation, including in the field of deep space communications. We are committed to taking tangible steps to deepen our collaboration on space sustainability and our respective regulations. The United States welcomes the close partnership with the United Kingdom on heliophysics missions and the United Kingdom's contribution to the NASA Helioswarm mission in particular. The United States welcomes potential participation by the United Kingdom in future commercial space station concepts. The United States and the United Kingdom are committed to studying opportunities for cooperation on space nuclear power and propulsion in accordance with their respective domestic laws and consistent with international obligations and commitments.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/joint-statement-the-atlantic-declaration-framework-for-twenty-first-century-united-states
Joe Biden,"June 13, 2023",Statement on the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index Report for May,"Today's report is good news for hard-working families. It shows continued progress tackling inflation at the same time that unemployment remains at historic lows. Annual inflation is now at the lowest level since March 2021, and less than half of what it was last June. After gas and grocery prices increased rapidly last year due to the war in Ukraine, inflation has fallen for 11 months in a row.
While there is more work to do, the plan that I laid out a year ago to bring down the cost of living and sustain stable and steady growth is working. We have taken action to bring down the cost of gas at the pump, prescription drugs, and health insurance premiums. At the same time, the unemployment rate has remained below 4 percent for the longest stretch in more than 50 years, helping to support wage gains over the last year, even after accounting for inflation. More Americans are in the workforce than in decades. And earlier this month, I brought Democrats and Republicans together around a bipartisan agreement that protects our historic economic progress and reduces the deficits by nearly $1 trillion over the next decade.
We are just getting started. My ""Investing in America"" agenda is rebuilding our infrastructure, manufacturing, and supply chains here at home, and creating good-paying jobs. Under my administration, private sector companies have invested over $470 billion in manufacturing, and America is seizing leadership in the industries that will be critical to our economic security for decades, like semiconductors and clean energy. I've never been more optimistic that our best days are ahead of us.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-the-bureau-labor-statistics-consumer-price-index-report-for-may-0
Joe Biden,"June 20, 2023",Statement on World Refugee Day,"On World Refugee Day, we join nations around the world in honoring the bravery and resilience of millions of refugees forced to flee violence and oppression. Together, as we celebrate their diverse contributions to the fabric of our communities, we renew our support to citizens and organizations who step up to provide them with critical care, services, and assistance.
Today, nearly 110 million people have been forced to leave their homes around the world, more refugees than at any other time in history. Russia's brutal and unjust assault of Ukraine forced millions to seek safety in other countries at a rate not seen since World War II. Meanwhile, men, women, and children who have been displaced for years—from Syria, Venezuela, Afghanistan, Somalia, South Sudan—have little hope for a solution to their displacement.
That is why my administration has worked hard to rebuild the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program. The United States plans to welcome 125,000 refugees next year, a level not achieved in three decades. We have also strengthened the U.S. resettlement program, including advancing opportunities for refugees to find work and contribute to our economy. In January, we launched the Welcome Corps, a new private sponsorship program that enables Americans to play a leading role in welcoming refugees as they build new lives in communities across the country. The United States continues to be the single largest provider of humanitarian assistance for refugees worldwide, including health care, clean water, and education, in partnership with international and nongovernmental partners, to tens of millions of refugees and the communities hosting them around the world.
But refugee protection is a shared, transnational challenge that requires shared solutions. That is why we are working with regional partners in our own hemisphere to provide protection and support for stabilization and integration to those in need, in alignment with the Los Angeles Declaration for Migration and Protection. We are working with the World Bank and the United Nations to strengthen refugee inclusion around the world, because when refugees are allowed to work, they contribute to the economy and strengthen the communities that host them.
Welcoming refugees is part of who we are as Americans; our Nation was founded by those fleeing religious persecution. When we take action to help refugees around the world and include them, we honor this past and are stronger for it. And together, we create a more hopeful and better future, one that embodies our highest values.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-world-refugee-day-8
Joe Biden,"June 20, 2023",Statement on United States Economic Sanctions Against Perpetrators of Conflict-Related Sexual Violence,"Yesterday nations around the world marked the International Day for the Elimination of Sexual Violence in Conflict, recognizing that this scourge continues to be widespread throughout the world, from Ukraine, to Ethiopia, to Haiti, to Sudan, and beyond. The United States is committed to doing all we can to end this blatant abuse of human rights. That's why today my administration is issuing historic sanctions targeting actors who perpetrate this abuse, marking the first time that a dedicated focus on conflict-related sexual violence has led to the imposition of U.S. sanctions.
Ending gender-based violence, wherever it occurs, and supporting survivors has been a high priority for me: as a Senator, Vice President, and since day one of my administration. Last November, I issued a Presidential memorandum to reinforce and strengthen our Government's use of financial, diplomatic, and legal tools to address conflict-related sexual violence. The sanctions issued today build off of this memorandum and designate two political and military targets from South Sudan who oversaw the rape and murder of civilians during the civil war and two ISIS terrorists responsible for the brutal rape and torture of Yazidi women and girls.
The United States stands in solidarity with survivors of sexual violence in conflict. And, together with our partners, we will continue to lead the effort to hold perpetrators accountable for this grave abuse of human rights.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-united-states-economic-sanctions-against-perpetrators-conflict-related-sexual
Joe Biden,"June 22, 2023",Joint Statement by President Biden and Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India,"1. President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. and Prime Minister Narendra Modi today affirmed a vision of the United States and India as among the closest partners in the world—a partnership of democracies looking into the 21st century with hope, ambition, and confidence. The U.S.-India Comprehensive Global and Strategic Partnership is anchored in a new level of trust and mutual understanding and enriched by the warm bonds of family and friendship that inextricably link our countries together. Together, we will build an even stronger, diverse U.S.-India partnership that will advance the aspirations of our people for a bright and prosperous future grounded in respect for human rights, and shared principles of democracy, freedom, and the rule of law.

Under this framework, both countries aspire to expand cooperation and collaboration to disrupt the illicit production and international trafficking of illicit drugs, including synthetic drugs, such as fentanyl and Amphetamine Type Stimulants and illicit use of their Precursors. Toward this end, they committed to a holistic public health partnership to prevent and treat illicit drug use, address workforce shortages and skilling requirements, and showcase a secure, resilient, reliable and growing pharmaceutical supply chain as a model for the world.
55. Prime Minister Modi conveyed his deep appreciation for the repatriation of antiquities to India by the United States. Both sides expressed strong interest in working quickly toward a Cultural Property Agreement, which would help to prevent illegal trafficking of cultural property from India and enhance cooperation on the protection and lawful exchange of cultural property.
56. The Leaders welcomed the establishment of the Tamil Studies Chair at the University of Houston and reinstating the Vivekananda Chair at the University of Chicago to further research and teaching of India's history and culture.

58. Taken together, the leaders today affirmed that this document, in its breadth and depth, represents the most expansive and comprehensive vision for progress in the history of our bilateral relationship. Still, our ambitions are to reach ever greater heights, and we commit both our governments and our peoples to this endeavor, now and into the future.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/joint-statement-president-biden-and-prime-minister-narendra-modi-india
Joe Biden,"June 26, 2023",Statement on International Day in Support of Victims of Torture,"Torture is prohibited everywhere and at all times. It is illegal, immoral, and a stain on our collective conscience. Today, on the International Day in Support of Victims of Torture, I reaffirm the United States opposition to all forms of inhumane treatment and our commitment to eliminating torture and assisting torture survivors as they heal and in their quests for justice.
Torture destroys lives, families, and communities. Yet, every day, people around the world are subjected to this horrific violation of their human rights and human dignity. In Ukraine, we have seen evidence of appalling brutality by members of Russia's forces. Patterns of abuse included torture to compel cooperation with occupation authorities and during interrogations, such as through beatings, electrical shock, mock executions, and use of sexual violence. Inside Russia itself, reports of torture in places of detention are commonplace, including against activists and critics of government policies. In Syria, tens of thousands of Syrians remain forcibly disappeared and subject to torture, with families often never knowing the fate and whereabouts of their loved ones. In North Korea, there are widespread credible reports of torture and other forms of cruel, inhumane, and degrading punishment by the government, including in political prison camps, and against women specifically, such as sexual violence, forced abortion, and forced sterilization. We see reports of torture from every region of the world: No country is immune.
It is our firm belief as a nation that we must hold ourselves to the same standards to which we hold others. This is why we continue to ensure that torture remains prohibited in all of its forms, without exception. This is also why the United States will continue to be the world's largest contributor to the U.N. Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture, which has provided desperately needed assistance to survivors of torture and their families from around the world as they undertake the long process of physical, psychological, economic, and social recovery. It is why we are providing the largest ever funding amount for the U.S. Survivors of Torture Program in the Office of Refugee Resettlement at HHS, and have requested even more funding in coming years, to help survivors and their families build new lives in the United States. It is why we work to promote justice for victims and survivors around the world. And it is why we must take this opportunity to reaffirm our commitment as a nation to ending the practice of torture once and for all.
I call on all nations around the world to join me in supporting rehabilitation and justice for torture survivors and in taking action to eliminate torture and inhumane treatment for good.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-international-day-support-victims-torture
Joe Biden,"July 09, 2023","Interview with Fareed Zakaria of CNN's ""Global Public Square""","ZAKARIA, CNN ANCHOR: This is GPS, the GLOBAL PUBLIC SQUARE. Welcome to all of you in the United States and around the world. I'm Fareed Zakaria.
ZAKARIA (voice-over): We have an important program for you today. With the president of the United States, Joseph R. Biden. I sat down with the president in the Roosevelt Room of the White House on Friday for an exclusive interview.
President Biden is headed to Europe for a trip that will take him to Vilnius, Lithuania for NATO's annual summit.
THE PRESIDENT: Holding NATO together is really critical.
ZAKARIA: It has been 500 days since Russia invaded Ukraine. Is there any sign of an end to this war? And will NATO offer Ukraine membership?
Also, is there a foreign relations with China or are we going to see an even more intense rivalry? And when can Bibi Netanyahu expect an invitation to the White House? All of this in a special interview with America's 46th president.
THE PRESIDENT: I think we have enormous opportunities and I just want to finish the job.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
ZAKARIA: I'll bring you my take later in the show but first President Biden is headed to Europe today for a five-day, three-country tour. The main focus of which will be a stop in Vilnius, Lithuania for NATO's annual summit.
NATO leaders had hoped to be celebrating Sweden joining the alliance at the summit this week but Turkey has blocked the process. Meanwhile, today marks 500 days of Russia's war in Ukraine and the Ukrainian counteroffensive continues. It is an important moment for NATO and an important moment for President Biden on the world stage.
I sat down with the president in the Roosevelt Room of the White House on Friday for a wide-ranging interview about his foreign policy.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
ZAKARIA: Mr. President, an honor to have you on the program.
THE PRESIDENT: Good to be with you. Thanks for having me.
ZAKARIA: When you go to the NATO summit, the big strategic issue is that Ukraine wants membership in NATO. Should it get membership in NATO?
THE PRESIDENT: I don't think it's ready for membership in NATO. But here's the deal. I spent, as you know, a great deal of time trying to hold NATO together because I believe Putin has had an overwhelming objective from the time he launched 185,000 troops into Ukraine, and that was to break NATO. He was confident, in my view and many in the intelligence community, he was confident he could break NATO.
So holding NATO together is really critical. I don't think there is unanimity in NATO about whether or not to bring Ukraine into the NATO family now, at this moment, in the middle of a war. For example, if you did that, then, you know, and I mean what I say, we're determined to commit every inch of territory that is NATO territory as a commitment that we've all made no matter what.
If the war is going on, then we're all in a war. You know, we're in a war with Russia if that were the case. So I think we have to lay out a path for the rational path for Russia, for -- excuse me, for Ukraine, to be able to qualify to get into NATO. And we have -- when the very first time that I met with Putin two years ago in Geneva and he said I want commitments on no Ukraine and NATO, I said we're not going to do that because it's an open-door policy. We're not going to shut anybody out.
NATO is a process that takes some time to meet all the qualifications and -- from democratization to a whole range of other issues. So in the meantime, though, I've spoken with Zelenskyy at length about this, and one of the things I indicated is the United States would be ready to provide while the process was going on, and it's going to take a while, while that process was going on to provide security ala the security we provide for Israel, providing the weaponry and the needs, capacity to defend themselves if there is an agreement, if there is a cease-fire, if there is a peace agreement.
And so I think we can work it out, but I think it's premature to say to call for a vote now because there is other qualifications that need to be met, including democratization and some of those issues.
[10:05:08]
ZAKARIA: The short-term issue at the NATO summit is Sweden. Will Sweden -- do you think, are you optimistic that Sweden will be invited to join NATO relatively soon?
THE PRESIDENT: I am. I am. I have met recently with the Swedish prime minister here. Sweden is a -- has the same value set that we have in NATO. A small nation but has the capacity to defend itself. They know how to fight and they're -- and I think they should be a member of NATO. You know better than anyone, the holdup is Turkey. Turkey and Sweden is making adjustments in their law to relate to whether or not these people burning the Quran.
Well, they aren't Swedes that are burning the Quran. They are migrants who are burning the Quran. And that puts -- that gives an excuse and/or it puts Erdogan in a tough spot at home. And so they're moving to stop that, number one. Number two, there is a -- Turkey is looking for modernization of F-16 aircraft. And Mitsotakis in Greece is also looking for some help. And so what I'm trying to quite frankly put together is a little bit of a consortium here where we're strengthening NATO in terms of the military capacity of both Greece as well as Turkey, and allow Sweden to come in. But it's a -- it's in play. It's not done.
ZAKARIA: But you're hopeful.
THE PRESIDENT: I'm hopeful. As a matter of fact I'm optimistic.
ZAKARIA: You have news -- the news is that the administration is going to provide cluster munitions to the Ukrainians. These are weapons that 100 nations banned, including some of our closest NATO allies. When there was news that the Russians might be using it admittedly against civilians your then press secretary said this might be constitute war crimes. What made you change your mind and decide to give them these weapons?
THE PRESIDENT: Two things, Fareed. I know it's a very difficult decision in my part. And by the way, I discussed this with our allies, discussed this with our friends up on the Hill, and we're in a situation where Ukraine continues to be brutally attacked across the board by munitions, by these cluster munitions that are -- have dud rates that are very, very low, I mean, very high that are a danger to civilians, number one.
Number two, the Ukrainians are running out of ammunition. The ammunition that they used to call them 155-millimeter weapons. This is a war relating to munitions, and they are running out of that ammunition and we're low on it. And so what I finally did, I took the recommendation of the Defense Department to, not permanently, but to allow for in this transition period where we have more 155 weapons, these shells for the Ukrainians, to provide them with something that has a very low dud rate. It's about -- I think it's 1.50, which is the least likely to be blown.
And it's not used in civilian areas. They're trying to get through those trenches and stop those tanks from rolling. And so -- but it was not an easy decision. And it's not -- we're not signatories of that agreement. But I -- it took me a while to be convinced to do it. But the main thing is they either have the weapons to stop the Russians now from their -- keeping them from stopping the Ukrainian offensive through these areas, or they don't. And I think they needed them.
(END VIDEOTAPE) ZAKARIA: Next on GPS, America's secretary of the Treasury just wrapped up a visit to China on the heels of a similar visit by the secretary of State. Is this a sign of a thawing of relations or will tensions between two the great powers continue to rise?
I'll ask President Biden about his China policy when we come back.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
[10:13:38]
ZAKARIA: Today Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen wrapped up a four-day trip to Beijing that was designed to ease U.S.-China tensions. That comes on the heel of Secretary of State Antony Blinken's trip to China last month. Despite this flurry of high-level diplomacy, the relationship has rarely been more tense. Each side is sparring over technology. Conflict over Taiwan remains a dangerous possibility and President Biden has enraged Beijing with statements indicating the U.S. would come to Taiwan's aid in a confrontation.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SCOTT PELLEY, CBS ""60 MINUTES"": Would U.S. forces defend the island?
THE PRESIDENT: Yes.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
ZAKARIA: Where does the relationship go from here? I asked President Biden.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
ZAKARIA: Let me ask you about China policy. Recently there have been announcements of new restrictions on Chinese companies relating to cloud computing. The Chinese are now beginning to make -- put restrictions in place on critical materials relating to semiconductors.
When I travel around the world, the sense I get is people are wondering, where is this going? Is this a ratchet where the United States will keep doing things like this, the Chinese will start responding and this goes on, or do you think there is a kind of stable point here where U.S.-China relations can be, as you have often said, competitive but also when necessary cooperative?
[10:15:04]
THE PRESIDENT: The answer is I think there is a stable point. But, look, if you don't mind my saying, just before going on air we talked about things are changing in the world. China is influx right now as well. China has enormous potential capacity but enormous problems as well. And so there is two things that I have tried to do in terms of our China policy. And by the way, I have met first the person with Xi Jinping more than any other world leader. 68 hours alone he and I with an interpreter back when I was vice president all the way through because as you remember it was clear he was going to be president and it wasn't inappropriate for the president of the United States, Barack Obama, to be traveling the world with him.
But I traveled 17,000 miles with him when I was vice president in China. And so we understand each other I think fairly well, number one. Number two, everything is changing. You know, you heard me say it before. The world is an inflection point. No matter what was happening, China is in a different place right now internally. Internally. I'll give you an example. He often says to me -- not often, on two occasions, called me and said why am I criticizing what's going on with western China and slave labor, et cetera.
And I said, remember, you told me that for China to be able to be secure, it needs to have one leader, a united China from Taiwan to the Tibetan Plateau, and that's when China has always done, we're going all the way back to the time when we have (INAUDIBLE). And I said -- and so for me not to talk about -- and you told me for you not to talk about unity of China would be able to lead. I said, well, the United States is the most unique nation in the world. We are organized based on an idea, for real. And not only idea. We hold these truths to be self-evident, all men and women are created equal, et cetera.
And we live up to it, we never walked away from it. And for me, for an American president to remain silent on slave labor would be totally inconsistent. And so I think -- well, I guess what I'm trying to say is -- I'm sorry to go on so long, is that I think there is a way to resolve -- to establish a working relationship with China that benefits them and us. And the last thing I'll tell you on this, is I also called him after he had that meeting with the Russians about this new relationship, et cetera.
And I said, this is not a threat, this is an observation. I said, since Russia went into Ukraine, 600 American corporations have pulled out of Russia. And you've told me that your economy depends on investment from Europe and the United States. And be careful. Be careful. And so he --
ZAKARIA: What did he say?
THE PRESIDENT: He listened and he didn't argue. And if you notice, he has not gone full bore in Russia. He is -- he talks about nuclear war being a disaster. You know, there is such a thing as security that is needed. Anyway, so, I think there is a way we can work through this and that's why I spent so much time beefing up -- I think if I told you three years ago, which I had written about in my notes, that I was going to get Japan deeply involved. Have them change their defense budget, have them work -- not that I've done it, but work with South Korea, work something out.
We're going to put together the Quad which is India, Australia, the United States and Japan. I got a call from him on that. He said why are you doing that. I said we're not doing that to surround you, we're doing that to maintain stability in the Indian Ocean and in the South China Sea. Because we believe the rules of the road about what constitutes international air space, international space and the water should be maintained. And so I just think it's going to take a little time. But, and where
it goes, depends a lot on what he's able to do internally in terms of his economy.
ZAKARIA: Do you think he wants China to replace the United States as the leading power, the defining power --
THE PRESIDENT: Oh, yes, I think he does. I mean, you know, I'm confident he wants to have the largest economy in the world and have us -- the largest military capacity in the world.
ZAKARIA: Rewrite the rules of the international order?
THE PRESIDENT: I think so. Not all of them, but he says, he pointed out to me, he said we weren't there when those rules were written about international air space and so on.
[10:20:05]
And, but I don't think he wants -- he's looking for war conflict, expansion of territory. And he, look, I sometimes say to my colleagues, I've spent over 180 hours talking with my NATO colleagues and European colleagues in person or around Zoom, I say to them, do you know anybody, any world leader who'd trade places with Xi Jinping? OK. I'll take their problems and you take mine. I don't know anybody would. Because it's not that he's a bad guy or a good guy, the circumstances are enormously complicated.
For example, you know, the whole notion of, you know, this new ring road that's going to put around -- going to invest in other nations. Well, it's ended up producing (INAUDIBLE). You know, these countries are in real trouble. And so, but it requires us to be more responsible. The West. I've been pushing very hard to get our European colleagues to invest in infrastructure in Africa, in South America, and to generate the kind of growth that they should have and could have because we're the ones that caused the environmental problems.
We clear-cut everything. And now we're telling them, no, everybody slow up. But I guess what I'm saying is I think there are positive answers to the dilemmas that exist without worrying about whether or not China is going to rule the world.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
ZAKARIA: President Biden has taken the unusual step of urging Israel's Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu to walk back his controversial judicial overhaul. Has Bibi done enough to get an invitation to the White House? I will ask the president.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
[10:26:11]
ZAKARIA: Late last month, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu revealed that he had been invited to visit China. That invitation underscores the absence of a similar one from the United States. In March, after sharp rare criticism of Netanyahu, for his proposed judicial overhaul, the U.S. president Joe Biden said that the prime minister would not receive a White House invitation in the near term. Months later, he has shown no sign of relenting.
So where do matters between the two leaders and their countries stand? I'm back with Joe Biden.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
ZAKARIA: Mr. President, what will it take for Bibi Netanyahu to get an invitation to the White House?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, first of all the Israeli president is going to be coming, we have other contacts. I've been, I think it is fair to say, an unyielding supporter of Israel for over -- I've only been around a couple of years, but for as long as I've been around. And Bibi, I think is trying to work through how he could work through his existing problems in terms of his coalition. He has -- I'm one of those that believes Israel is almost a security risk for a two-state solution.
I think it's a mistake to think that as some members of his cabinet and this is one of the most extremist members of cabinets that I've seen. I go all the way back to Golda Meir and, you know, not that she was extreme but I go back to that era. I think that the fact that the Palestinian Authority has lost its credibility, not necessarily because of what Israel has done, just because it is just lost its credibility, number one.
And number two, created a vacuum for extremism among the Palestinians. They are -- there are some very extreme elements. So it's not all Israel now in the West Bank, all Israel's problem. But they are a part of the problem. And particularly those individuals in the cabinet who say, they have no right -- we could settle anywhere we want, they have to right to be here, et cetera. And I think we -- we're talking with them regularly, trying to tamp down what is going on and hopefully Bibi will continue to move toward moderation and changing the (INAUDIBLE).
ZAKARIA: You've had tough words about Saudi Arabia from the start about the Khashoggi killing and things like that. You talked about needing a kind of new relationship. They've been pretty unyielding when you've asked them to pump more oil. They've slashed oil recently. Now Saudi Arabia wants a defense treaty from the United States promising that you will protect them and they want civilian nuclear capacity which again the U.S. would have to provide. And in return, they would recognize Israel. Are you going to do it?
THE PRESIDENT: We're a long way from there. We've got a lot to talk about. For example, that trip I went, which was criticized for my going, a number of things have happened on that trip. On that trip I was able to negotiate over flights so Israeli could know -- Israeli aircraft could now over fly Saudi Arabia, number one. Number two, the price of oil is actually down, not up, and it's not because they have done one thing or the other. But the world is changing, our policies relative to renewables are real.
[10:30:00]
THE PRESIDENT: Number three, we found ourselves in a circumstance where the war if Yemen is essentially for a year now been -- it's ended -- peace is being kept. So, we're making progress in the region. And it depends upon the conduct and what is asked of us for them to recognize Israel. Quite frankly -- I don't think they have much of a problem with Israel, quite frankly. And whether or not we would provide a means by which they could have civilian nuclear power and/or be a guarantor of their security, that is -- I think that is a little way off.
ZAKARIA: Finally, Mr. President, you've often said when people ask you about your age, just watch me. And I think a lot of people do watch you and are impressed and they think you've been a great president. You've brought the economy back. You've restored relations with the world. But many of these people do say and these are hardened supporters of yours, the next thing he should do is step aside and let another generation of Democrats take the baton. Why are they wrong?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, let me just -- they're not right or wrong. It is -- look, to use the phrase again, I think we're at an inflection point. I think the world is changing and I think I -- there is one thing that comes with age, if you're being honest about it your whole life and that is some wisdom. I think we're on the cusp of being able to make significant positive changes in the world. Really honest to God do.
You've seen what we've done in Europe. Europe is more united than it has ever been since World War II -- end of World War II. You've seen what we've been able to do in the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea. We've united that part of the world including the 50 --basically 50 island nations that are participating, who will be here by the way shortly.
I think we're putting the world together in a way that is going to make things significantly -- how can I say it -- more secure for people. We're uniting democracies -- have a possibility of uniting democracies in a way that hadn't happened ever. And, so, I think that whether it is the far east, whether it is NATO, whether it is Europe, whether it is what is going on in Africa, I think we have enormous opportunities. And I think I just want to finish the job. And I think we can do that in the next six years.
ZAKARIA: Mr. President, it has been an honor. Thank you.
THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Appreciate it. Thanks.

Joe Biden,"July 27, 2023",Joint Statement by President Biden and Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni of Italy,"Today, the President of the United States, Joseph R. Biden, and the President of the Council of Ministers of the Italian Republic, Giorgia Meloni, met at the White House. They reaffirmed the unshakable alliance, strategic partnership, and deep friendship between the United States and Italy. The ties between Italy and the United States are rooted in history, cultural affinity, and economic cooperation. They are founded on our shared values and principles—democracy, freedom, respect for human rights—reinforced by the shared objective to promote peace and security, enhance prosperity, and advance sustainability all around the globe. The connections between our people are at the heart of this relationship. Both leaders highlighted the important role of the Italian-American community, whose contributions make the United States stronger, more prosperous, and more vibrant. Prime Minister Meloni also affirmed the key contributions of Italian communities abroad.
President Biden and Prime Minister Meloni both affirm that the NATO Summit in Vilnius demonstrated the unity and the strength of the transatlantic bond, and the Alliance's unique capacity to adapt its deterrence and defense posture to address challenges from all strategic directions, including NATO's Southern Flank. Both leaders also stand with Ukraine as it defends itself from Russia's illegal aggression. The United States and Italy will continue to provide political, military, financial, and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine for as long as it takes, with the aim to reach a just and lasting peace that fully respects the UN Charter and Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The United States and Italy also recognize the need to address the global consequences of the conflict, especially on vulnerable countries' stability, energy, and food security. They reaffirm the importance of enabling Ukraine to export food via the Black Sea and condemn Russia's unilateral withdrawal from the Black Sea Grain Initiative, which has been instrumental in reducing world food prices, and its attacks on Ukrainian grain storage and transport infrastructure. They welcome the progress on food systems transformation reported at the Stocktaking Moment of the UN Food Systems Summit held in Rome on 24-26 July. Both sides also commit to further coordination on Ukraine's reconstruction and recognized the role Italy will play in this effort, with Italy's presidency of the G7 in 2024 and hosting of the Ukraine Reconstruction Conference in 2025.
The United States and Italy note the vital importance of shared efforts to promote stability and prosperity in the wider Mediterranean region, including by addressing the root causes of instability, terrorism, and irregular migration flows. The United States and Italy affirm their support for the Tunisian people as Tunisia endures continued economic and political challenges. The United States and Italy also affirm their shared desire for a prosperous, secure, and democratic Tunisia. The United States welcomed the Conference on Migration and Development held on July 23 in Rome, as well as the establishment of the ""Rome Process"" to promote partnerships between countries of origin, transit, and destination of migration in the broader Mediterranean region, the Middle East and Africa. In this framework, the United States takes note of the Italian government's ""Mattei Plan"" for Africa.
The United States and Italy reaffirm their shared commitment to the security, stability, and prosperity of the Western Balkans and their longstanding support for the region's Euro-Atlantic integration. They determined to reinforce coordination to favor de-escalation and reconciliation and acknowledged the crucial role of the Quint. The United States welcomes the Italian government's commitment in the Western Balkans, including through the contribution of the Italian armed forces to KFOR, EULEX, and EUFOR Althea missions.
The United States and Italy are firmly committed to a free, open, prosperous, inclusive, and secure Indo-Pacific. The United States welcomes the increased presence of Italy in the region. The two sides reiterate the vital importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, which is instrumental to regional and global security and prosperity. The United States and Italy also commit to strengthen bilateral and multilateral consultations on the opportunities and challenges posed by the People's Republic of China.
The United States and Italy pledge to continue coordination, including within multilateral fora, on issues to advance global prosperity, inclusive growth, and peace and security. The United States looks forward to Italy's leadership of the G7 in 2024, where the G7 will increase efforts to accelerate the clean energy transition, and tackle pressing global challenges, including the climate crisis, poverty, food insecurity, economic security, critical mineral supplies, and migration, further engaging in dialogue and cooperation on all these issues with developing countries, and especially with African countries. The leaders are united in their commitment to raise the level of ambition and commitment to supporting developing counties hard hit by multiple crises and to accelerating progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
President Biden and Prime Minister Meloni committed to advance work to evolve the multilateral development banks to make them more responsive to shared global challenges like climate change, pandemics, and conflict and fragility, including through implementation of critical financial reforms begun under Italy's leadership in the G20 and a review of the climate finance architecture to make it more effective and efficient. In parallel, the leaders committed to work together toward a successful IDA 21 next year. The leaders also discussed ways to explore mobilizing more headroom and concessional finance to boost the World Bank's capacity to support countries addressing global challenges and provide strong support for the poorest countries.
The United States welcomes the participation of Italy in the Minerals Security Partnership and its intention to join the steering committee of the Blue Dot Network. Both sides also stress their support for the G7 Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment. Italy also confirms that the Italian Presidency of the G7 will support the Global Coalition to address synthetic drug threats. The United States also welcomes Italy's bid to host the World Expo in 2030, acknowledging the opportunity of using the Expo as an inclusive platform to find shared solutions to common challenges.
The United States and Italy share a mutual intent to enhance relations with Africa on the basis of a partnership among equals, and note the importance of mobilizing the private sector, our UN partners, multilateral development banks, and international financial institutions in support of these efforts. Both countries also renew the commitment to promote effective policies to fight terrorism in the framework of the D-ISIS Coalition.
The United States and Italy share a focus on the role of emerging technologies in shaping the global economy and influencing the future of the international system in the coming decades. Both sides recognize cybersecurity as a key component of resilience that enables societies to reap the benefits of industrial and technological cooperation and development. The United States and Italy commit to deepen bilateral and multilateral collaboration in these domains, along with intensified focus on the impact of artificial intelligence, including under Italy's Presidency of the G7 next year. Both sides welcome the Counter Ransomware Initiative and international coordination efforts, including the ""NATO Cyber Pledge Conference"" in Rome.
The United States and Italy recognize that economic resilience requires de-risking, diversifying, and reducing excessive dependencies to build resilient and secure supply chains. Both sides underline the importance of strengthening transatlantic economic cooperation, including through the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council and the U.S.-EU Energy Council, to improve security, cooperate to secure energy supplies and avoid fossil fuel dependencies, continue to secure supplies of critical minerals, and ensure that technologies work for—not against—democracies, and create opportunities for growth, jobs, and public welfare. The United States and Italy both reaffirm their commitment to continue the momentum from the G7 Hiroshima Summit related to strengthening economic resilience and economic security, including efforts under the G7 Coordination Platform on Economic Coercion to increase our collective assessment, preparedness, deterrence and response to economic coercion.
Free and fair trade remains a fundamental tool to foster the balanced growth of the global economy and to benefit our people. U.S.-Italy bilateral trade, amounting to $117 billion in 2022 and steadily growing, is a pillar of this expanding partnership. Bilateral investment between the United States and Italy supports hundreds of thousands of jobs across both countries. The United States and Italy commit to strengthen the economic partnership by increasing cooperation, co-investments, workforce development, and friend-shoring across different strategic sectors that will define not only the present, but our common future, including on emerging technologies, the clean energy transition, and the defense sector. The sides also commit to intensify bilateral judicial cooperation, in line with ongoing joint efforts to promote the rule of law and counter international organized crime, including human trafficking.
Both President Biden and Prime Minister Meloni affirm the existential threat posed by climate change and their commitment to taking decisive actions this decade to keep within reach their shared goal of limiting the global average temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Both recall the valuable contribution of the Net-Zero Government Initiative, launched by the United States and joined by Italy, inviting governments to lead by example and achieve net-zero emissions from national government operations by no later than 2050. The United States and Italy share an interest in working together to address emissions in developing countries, including methane. The two countries plan to continue enhanced cooperation and alignment on timely solutions towards achieving shared climate goals and an ambitious COP28 outcome, with the aim of ensuring social, economic and environmental sustainability.
The United States and Italy commit to strengthen space cooperation, including through the creation of a ""new space dialogue"" to promote industrial cooperation with government support. Both reaffirm their partnership on space exploration and express, as original signatories, support for the principles of the Artemis Accords. The United States and Italy recognize the importance of addressing space threats through norms, rules, and principles of responsible behaviors, and welcome innovative new commercial space partnerships, including to advance human spaceflight. Both sides look to encourage further space-related investments, and industrial collaboration, including on commercial space stations.
The leaders also commit to strengthen bilateral collaboration in science and technology research and development, anchored in values of democracy, equity, fair competition, freedom of inquiry, openness, research integrity and transparency. Both sides confirm their shared objective to foster high quality and equitable education, including through partnerships between respective high schools and universities and arrangements for joint or double degrees. Initiatives to promote the study of languages and cultures and broader people-to-people exchanges are especially important in this approach, including the flagship U.S.-Italy Fulbright Program, which celebrates its 75th anniversary in 2023. Both countries intend to develop new ways to enhance high level research and exchanges, including through the Italian Academy for Advanced Studies in America. The United States and Italy also commit to continue working together to protect and preserve cultural heritage, including within the framework of the U.S.-Italy bilateral cultural heritage agreement.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/joint-statement-president-biden-and-prime-minister-giorgia-meloni-italy
Joe Biden,"August 18, 2023","Joint Statement by President Biden, President Yoon Suk Yeol of South Korea, and Prime Minister Fumio Kishida of Japan—The Spirit of Camp David","We, the leaders of Japan, the Republic of Korea (ROK), and the United States, convened at Camp David to inaugurate a new era of trilateral partnership. We do so at a time of unparalleled opportunity for our countries and our citizens, and at a hinge point of history, when geopolitical competition, the climate crisis, Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine, and nuclear provocations test us. This is a moment that requires unity and coordinated action from true partners, and it is a moment we intend to meet, together. Japan, the Republic of Korea, and the United States are determined to align our collective efforts because we believe our trilateral partnership advances the security and prosperity of all our people, the region, and the world. In this spirit, President Biden commended President Yoon and Prime Minister Kishida for their courageous leadership in transforming relations between Japan and the ROK. With the renewed bonds of friendship—and girded by the ironclad U.S.-Japan and U.S.-ROK alliances—each of our bilateral relationships is now stronger than ever. So too is our trilateral relationship.
On this historic occasion, we commit to expand our cooperation trilaterally and raise our shared ambition to a new horizon, across domains and across the Indo-Pacific and beyond. We will strengthen our economies, provide resilience and prosperity, support the free and open international order based on the rule of law, and bolster regional and global peace and security, especially as current and incoming members of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). We will strengthen our coordination on promoting democracy and protecting human rights. And we will enhance strategic coordination between the U.S.-Japan and U.S.-ROK alliances and bring our trilateral security cooperation to new heights. As we embark together in this new era, our shared values will be our guide and a free and open Indo-Pacific, in which our half-billion people are safe and prosperous, will be our collective purpose.
***
Today, we declare openly that we are united in a common purpose to strengthen our shared region. Our mandate is to ensure Japan, the Republic of Korea, and the United States are aligned in our objectives and in our actions, generating the common capacity required to ensure that the Indo-Pacific is thriving, connected, resilient, stable, and secure. Ours is a partnership built not just for our people but for the entire Indo-Pacific.
We announce our governments' commitment to consult with each other in an expeditious manner to coordinate our responses to regional challenges, provocations, and threats that affect our collective interests and security. Through these consultations we intend to share information, align our messaging, and coordinate response actions. To this end we will improve our trilateral communication mechanism to facilitate regular and timely communication between our countries, including our national leadership. We will hold trilateral meetings between our leaders, foreign ministers, defense ministers, and national security advisors at least annually, complementing existing trilateral meetings between our respective foreign and defense ministries. We will also hold the first trilateral meeting between our finance ministers as well as launch a new commerce and industry ministers track that will meet annually. We will also launch an annual Trilateral Indo-Pacific Dialogue to coordinate implementation of our Indo-Pacific approaches and to continually identify new areas for common action. Recognizing the increased threat posed by foreign information manipulation and misuse of surveillance technology, we will also discuss ways to coordinate our efforts to counter disinformation. We welcome the trilateral development policy dialogue planned in October to advance concrete discussions for deepening development policy coordination. We are resolute in our determination to uphold regional security, strengthen Indo-Pacific engagement, and promote common prosperity.
We wholeheartedly reaffirm ASEAN centrality and unity and our support for the ASEAN-led regional architecture. We are committed to working closely with ASEAN partners to support robust implementation and mainstreaming of the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific. We are collectively working to support sustainable energy and promoting water security and climate resilience in the Mekong River Basin. We reaffirm, too, our support of Pacific Island countries and intend to work in genuine partnership with the Pacific in a transparent and effective manner, consistent with the Pacific Way, that strengthens individual countries and the Pacific region. We plan to coordinate regional capacity-building efforts to ASEAN and Pacific Island countries to ensure that they are mutually reinforcing and maximally beneficial to our valued partners, including through capacity building efforts in cybersecurity and financial integrity and our new Trilateral Maritime Security Cooperation Framework.
We share concerns about actions inconsistent with the rules-based international order, which undermine regional peace and prosperity. Recalling the publicly announced position of each of our countries regarding the dangerous and aggressive behavior supporting unlawful maritime claims that we have recently witnessed by the People's Republic of China (PRC) in the South China Sea, we strongly oppose any unilateral attempts to change the status quo in the waters of the Indo-Pacific. In particular, we steadfastly oppose the militarization of reclaimed features; the dangerous use of coast guard and maritime militia vessels; and coercive activities. In addition, we are concerned about illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing. We reiterate our firm commitment to international law, including the freedom of navigation and overflight, as reflected in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). The July 2016 award in the South China Sea arbitration sets out the legal basis for the peaceful resolution of maritime conflicts between the parties to that proceeding. We reaffirm the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait as an indispensable element of security and prosperity in the international community. There is no change in our basic positions on Taiwan, and we call for a peaceful resolution of cross-Strait issues.
Furthermore, we reaffirm our commitment to the complete denuclearization of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) in accordance with relevant UNSC resolutions and urge the DPRK to abandon its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. We call on all UN Member States to fully implement all relevant UNSC resolutions. We strongly condemn the DPRK's unprecedented number of ballistic missile launches, including multiple intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) launches and conventional military actions that pose a grave threat to peace and security on the Korean Peninsula and beyond. We express concern regarding the DPRK's illicit cyber activities that fund its unlawful WMD and ballistic missile programs. We announce the establishment of a new trilateral working group to drive our cooperation, including with the international community, to combat DPRK cyber threats and block its cyber-enabled sanctions evasion. Japan, the ROK, and the United States remain committed to reestablishing dialogue with the DPRK with no preconditions. We also commit to strengthening cooperation to promote respect for human rights in the DPRK and reaffirm a shared commitment to the immediate resolution of the issues of abductees, detainees, and unrepatriated prisoners of war. We express support for the goal of the ROK's Audacious Initiative and support a unified Korean Peninsula that is free and at peace.
The United States unequivocally reaffirms that its extended deterrence commitments to both Japan and the ROK are ironclad and backed by the full range of U.S. capabilities. Our three countries announce today that we intend to hold annual, named, multi-domain trilateral exercises on a regular basis to enhance our coordinated capabilities and cooperation. In mid-August, our three countries conducted a maritime ballistic missile defense warning test for the real-time sharing of missile warning data to demonstrate our ability to deter and respond to the DPRK's advancing nuclear and missile threats more effectively. By the end of 2023, we intend to operationalize our sharing of missile warning data on the DPRK in real-time in fulfillment of commitments reflected in the November 2022 Phnom Penh Statement, and our countries have taken initial steps to test our technical capabilities for real-time sharing of missile warning data. We are committed to pursuing enhanced ballistic missile defense cooperation to counter DPRK nuclear and missile threats. We reaffirm that achieving a world without nuclear weapons is a common goal for the international community, and we continue to make every effort to ensure that nuclear weapons are never used again.
Even as we deepen our security partnership, we will also maintain focus on building robust cooperation in the economic security and technology spheres, leveraging the unique capabilities that each of our countries brings to bear. In implementing our commitments in the Phnom Penh Statement, our national security teams have met twice under the auspices of the Trilateral Economic Security Dialogue to advance our shared objectives. We are now cooperating trilaterally on supply chain resilience, particularly on semiconductors and batteries, as well as on technology security and standards, clean energy and energy security, biotechnology, critical minerals, pharmaceuticals, artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, and scientific research.
Going forward, our countries are committed to working closely together to launch early warning system pilots to expand information sharing and enhance policy coordination on possible disruptions to global supply chains as well as to better prepare us to confront and overcome economic coercion. We will continue to develop the Partnership for Resilient and Inclusive Supply-chain Enhancement (RISE) to help developing countries play larger roles in the supply chains of clean energy products. We will also enhance cooperation on technology protection measures to prevent the cutting-edge technologies we develop from being illegally exported or stolen abroad. To that end, we will conduct inaugural exchanges between the U.S. Disruptive Technology Strike Force and Japanese and ROK counterparts to deepen information-sharing and coordination across our enforcement agencies. We will also continue to strengthen trilateral cooperation on export controls to prevent our technologies from being diverted for military or dual-use capabilities that could potentially threaten international peace and security.
In tandem with technology protection measures, we will bolster combined and collaborative scientific and technological innovation, including by pursuing new trilateral National Labs cooperation and expanding trilateral collaborative research and development and personnel exchanges, particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) sectors. In addition, we seek to expand trilateral cooperation on open radio access network (RAN) and further enhance trilateral dialogue on space security cooperation, particularly regarding threats in the space domain, national space strategies, and the responsible use of space. We acknowledge the crucial role of AI as a transformative technology and affirm our respective efforts to help shape international governance on AI and ensure safe, secure, and trustworthy AI, in line with our shared democratic values and as the basis for international discussions on frontier AI systems.
We are fully committed to continuing to eliminate barriers to economic participation and build diverse, accessible, and inclusive economies in which all our people—including women and marginalized groups—can succeed. We will work to further strengthen our people-to-people ties, including among our young people and students. We will continue our cooperation toward the successful conclusion of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) negotiations, and President Yoon and Prime Minister Kishida welcome the United States' hosting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum this year. President Yoon and President Biden applaud Japan's strong and principled leadership at the G7 Hiroshima Summit to respond to challenges that the international community is facing. Together, we are committed to accelerate the clean energy transition; mobilize financing for quality infrastructure and resilient supply chains, including through trilateral collaboration among our development finance institutions as well as through the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII); and promote sustainable economic growth and financial stability, as well as orderly and well-functioning financial markets. We will continue our ambitious agenda to evolve the multilateral development banks to make them more responsive to shared global challenges. The Leaders committed to explore delivering new World Bank Group concessional resources and headroom to fight poverty by addressing global challenges in line with its forthcoming concessionality framework and enhancing resources for the poorest countries, including crisis response.
We are united in our support for Ukraine. We reaffirm our commitment to stand with Ukraine against Russia's unprovoked and brutal war of aggression that has shaken the foundation of the international order. We commit to continue providing assistance to Ukraine, imposing coordinated, robust sanctions on Russia, and accelerating the reduction of dependency on Russian energy. We believe the lasting lesson from this catastrophic war of aggression must be the international community's abiding will to uphold the principles of territorial integrity, sovereignty, and the peaceful resolution of disputes. We reaffirm our view that when these foundational principles are rejected anywhere, they represent a threat to our region. We are unified in our intent to ensure that no such egregious acts are ever perpetrated again.
***
We depart Camp David with a shared resolve and optimism for the future. The opportunity that lies before us was not guaranteed—it was embraced. It is the product of a determination, fiercely held by each of us, that if we are to deliver a peaceful and prosperous future for our people, and the people of the Indo-Pacific, we must more often stand together. Today, we declare that a new chapter in our trilateral relationship has begun. We are aligned in our vision; undaunted in the face of our era's greatest challenges; and, most of all, united in our belief that Japan, the Republic of Korea, and the United States can meet those challenges together, now and in the future.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/joint-statement-president-biden-president-yoon-suk-yeol-south-korea-and-prime-minister
Joe Biden,"August 24, 2023",Statement on Ukraine's Independence Day,"Today the people of Ukraine are once more marking their Independence Day, while suffering the all-out assault of Putin's craven war for land and power. For 18 months, Ukrainian families have lived under the daily threat of Russian rockets and the reality of brutal attacks. But the people of Ukraine have refused to break.
On this Independence Day, as they have since Russia first invaded Ukraine in 2014, brave Ukrainian women and men are defending Ukraine from assaults on fundamental principles essential to every nation on the planet: sovereignty and territorial integrity. They are showing the world once more that freedom is worth fighting for.
Independence means the freedom to choose your own future. It's precious. Each year on July 4, Americans celebrate our Independence Day as a time to remember the price we paid for our freedom and all the blessings that flow from it. So today, as Putin continues his brutal war to erase Ukraine's independence and redraw the map of our world by force, Americans all across the country stand united with the people of Ukraine.
The United States will continue our work, together with partners all around the world, to support Ukraine's ability to defend itself against Russia's aggression, to uphold the foundational principles of the U.N. Charter, and to help the Ukrainian people build the secure, prosperous, and independent future they deserve.
Our commitment to Ukraine's independence is unwavering and enduring. That's why the United States and other G-7 nations issued a joint declaration in Lithuania last month pledging to help Ukraine maintain armed forces capable of deterring Russian aggression in years to come, a declaration which over 25 nations have now joined. Together with our partners in Europe, we are supporting Ukraine in their fight for freedom now, and we will help them over the long term.
We are also working with nations everywhere to hold Russian forces accountable for the war crimes and other atrocities they have committed in Ukraine. That includes the forcible removal of thousands of Ukrainian children to Russia. These children have been stolen from their parents and kept apart from their families. It's unconscionable. And today we are announcing new sanctions to hold those responsible for these forced transfers and deportations to account and to demand that Ukrainian children be returned to their families.
I sincerely hope that next year, Ukrainians will be able to celebrate their Independence Day in peace and safety, knowing how their extraordinary courage inspired the world. May Ukraine's Independence Day be a reminder that the forces of darkness and dominion will never extinguish the flame of liberty that lives in the heart of free people everywhere.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-ukraines-independence-day-0

Transboundary cooperation and sustainable development are crucial as the two countries jointly address new challenges and opportunities including food security and sustainable water management, supporting communities and their livelihoods, promoting economic connectivity, tackling non-traditional security issues, and working to provide opportunities for human resource development. Both sides welcomed the Mekong-U.S. Partnership and other Mekong-centered mechanisms such as the Mekong River Commission and the Ayeyawady-Chao Phraya-Mekong Economic Cooperation Strategy (ACMECS). The Leaders committed to working closely with other Mekong countries toward expanded collaboration within this framework, as well as in the Friends of the Mekong.
The Leaders stressed the importance of the full implementation of the ASEAN Five Point Consensus and echo ASEAN's calls for the immediate cessation of violence and de-escalation among all concerned parties in Myanmar in order to create conducive environment for the delivery of humanitarian assistance and inclusive national dialogue.
Both Leaders discussed other regional and international issues of mutual concern and underscored the importance of the peaceful resolution of all disputes in accordance with the United Nations Charter, seeking to ensure people's safety and the protection of infrastructure critical to their livings.
The United States and Vietnam reaffirmed support for the establishment of a durable peace on and the complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, and urged all parties concerned to fully and strictly fulfill their international obligations and commitments, including under relevant UN Security Council resolutions.
On Ukraine, the two leaders emphasized the need for establishing a comprehensive, just, and durable peace in accordance with the UN Charter and international law.
Since normalization of bilateral relations in 1995, the Vietnam-U.S. relationship has flourished vigorously and fruitfully, growing both in depth and substance. This new chapter will bring our partnership to new heights. Together, we will realize the aspirations of the people of our countries for a bright and dynamic future that contributes to the maintenance of peace, stability, cooperation and development across a crucial region and the world at large.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/joint-statement-elevating-united-states-vietnam-relations-comprehensive-strategic
Joe Biden,"September 14, 2023",Statement on the Appointment of Penny S. Pritzker as United States Special Representative for Ukraine's Economic Recovery,"Today I am proud to announce that I am appointing Penny Pritzker to serve as the new U.S. Special Representative for Ukraine's Economic Recovery.
As an accomplished public servant, former Secretary of Commerce, and transformative industry leader—with deep familial ties to Ukraine—Special Representative Pritzker brings decades of experience and expertise to this critical position. Working in lockstep with the Ukrainian Government, our allies and partners, international financial institutions, and the private sector, she will drive the United States efforts to help rebuild the Ukrainian economy. This includes mobilizing public and private investment, shaping donor priorities, and working to open export markets and businesses shut down by Russia's brutal attacks and destruction. Special Representative Pritzker will also work with Ukraine's other international partners, including via the G-7 coordination platform, to ensure that international efforts are complementary and mutually reinforcing, as well as to encourage international partners to keep stepping up their support for Ukraine's immediate economic recovery needs. Special Representative Pritzker will help the Ukrainian Government make reforms needed to strengthen its economy, and Special Representative Pritzker will work with Ukraine to help ensure that as Ukraine begins to rebuild, it rebuilds stronger.
As we take this next step to help Ukraine forge a stronger future, we remain steadfastly committed to helping it defend its freedom today. The brave people of Ukraine have inspired the world with their resilience and resolve, and as this announcement reaffirms, the United States remains committed to stand with them, for as long as it takes.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-the-appointment-penny-s-pritzker-united-states-special-representative-for
Joe Biden,"September 15, 2023",Statement on International Day of Democracy,"When I came into office, it was clear that one of the defining questions of our time was whether democracies could still come together to deliver for our people in a rapidly changing world. I believed then—as I do now—that the answer is yes. Democracy remains humanity's most enduring means to advance prosperity, security, and dignity for all. And over the last 2½ years, we've proved it.
Here at home, we've demonstrated that American democracy can tackle the challenges that matter most in peoples' lives. Through the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, we made a generational investment to deliver safe roads, clean water, and high-speed internet to communities across the country. We passed the Inflation Reduction Act, a historic law that lowers health care, prescription drug, and energy costs, and takes the most aggressive action to confront the climate crisis in history. I signed the CHIPS and Science Act, which positions U.S. workers to compete in manufacturing today and lead the industries of tomorrow. A year ago today, I hosted the first White House summit ever to counter hate-motivated violence and foster unity. In January, I signed the bipartisan Electoral Count Reform Act to protect the will of the people and the peaceful transition of power, democracy's threshold liberties. And I will remain vigilant in fighting to protect Americans' right to vote through free, fair, and secure elections.
Abroad, democracy has faced a test for the ages, and the United States and our partners and allies have stepped up. When Russia launched its brutal assault against Ukraine, the United States helped rally the world to stand with the brave people of Ukraine as they defend their liberty. We've revitalized the G-7's commitment to drive inclusive economic growth, including by launching the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, which aims to mobilize $600 billion for quality infrastructure projects in low- and middle-income countries by 2027. We've elevated partnerships like the Quad, which brings together four key democracies in the Indo-Pacific to deliver for people around the world. For the first time ever, we formally identified corruption—which erodes the ability of governments across the world to deliver for their people—as a threat to U.S. national security and launched the first U.S. Strategy on Countering Corruption. We've mobilized an unprecedented Governmentwide effort to counter the proliferation and misuse of commercial spyware that enables human rights abuses around the world. We have dedicated more resources than ever to digital and physical security training for journalists and launched a new fund with global partners to provide defense counsel to journalists facing legal threats meant to silence them—because a free press is essential to democracy. And at the second Summit for Democracy in March, we helped bring more than 100 countries together once again, catalyzing hundreds of commitments to support independent media, empower human rights activists, defend free and fair elections, advance rights-respecting technology, and counter authoritarianism.
Today we recommit to this important work. Because we know there is nothing inevitable about democracy, just as generations before us stepped up to defend it, we must answer the call to preserve democracy for generations to come. So together, let us continue to remember that government of the people, by the people, and for the people is our greatest strength. And let us continue to build a future of stronger human rights protection and freedom for all.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-international-day-democracy
Joe Biden,"September 25, 2023",Joint Statement—U.S.-Pacific Islands Forum Leaders Statement on Reaffirming U.S.-Pacific Partnership,"We—the governments of Australia, Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, French Polynesia, Kiribati, Nauru, New Caledonia, New Zealand, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Republic of the Marshall Islands, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, and the United States of America—meet on the occasion of the second U.S.-Pacific Islands Forum Summit, held at the White House in Washington, D.C. from 25-26 September 2023.
We reaffirm our support for the Declaration on U.S.-Pacific Partnership issued in Washington on September 29, 2022, which outlined our shared vision for a resilient Pacific region of peace, harmony, security, social inclusion, and prosperity, where individuals can reach their potential, the environment can thrive, and democracy can flourish.
We commit to working together in genuine partnership, rooted in mutual respect, consistent with the principles of the UN charter, and in the spirit of transparency and accountability.
Political Leadership and Regionalism 
1. We recognise and reaffirm the importance of strong and enduring political will and leadership in progressing regional priorities, in respect of Pacific cultures, values and traditions. We commit to partnering to support and nurture generations of leadership grounded in the Pacific Way with a commitment to gender equality and social inclusion.
2. We welcome the United States' renewed commitment to the Pacific Islands region and to strengthening both bilateral and regional cooperation in support of Pacific Islands' development aspirations and to enable a stable, secure, inclusive, and prosperous regional environment. We commit to working together to support the successful delivery and implementation of the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent (2050 Strategy).
3. We acknowledge the unique political relationship between the United States and the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of Palau, a cornerstone of U.S.-Pacific cooperation, and we underscore the paramount importance of the timely and successful completion of negotiations of, and the relevant domestic processes regarding agreements relating to, the Compacts of Free Association between the United States and these three Pacific Island States and their subsequent implementation. The United States plans to work expeditiously to meet the needs of the Republic of the Marshall Islands through ongoing Compact negotiations.
4. We reiterate the importance of upholding the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, as well as shared values enshrined in the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty (Rarotonga Treaty), and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. We reaffirm our commitment to the international nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament regime and its central role in maintaining international peace and security, including in the Pacific. States Parties to the Rarotonga Treaty reaffirmed their commitment to the maintenance of the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone and encouraged the United States to ratify the Treaty's protocols, as soon as possible.
5. We reaffirm the importance of the rules-based international order and the UN Charter, and condemn all wars of aggression, including Russia's brutal war against Ukraine and underscore the need to reach, as soon as possible, a comprehensive, just and lasting peace that respects Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, in line with the UN Charter and relevant UN resolutions.
6. We acknowledge the legacy of World War II and the nuclear legacy of the Cold War. We, too, acknowledge and welcome the United States' commitment to addressing legacy issues from World War II, including working with allies and partners to address the safe removal of unexploded ordinances. We, too, acknowledge the United States' commitment to addressing the Republic of the Marshall Islands' ongoing environmental, public health concerns, and other welfare concerns.
Partnership and Cooperation 
7. Recognising the importance of building and maintaining this partnership, we commit to holding the next U.S.-Pacific Islands Forum Summit in 2025 and intend to hold biennial political engagements thereafter. We intend to enhance U.S.-Pacific Partnership through regularised Ministerial and Senior Officials engagements, including the PIF Leaders Dialogue with Forum Dialogue Partners. We intend to strengthen our bilateral and regional cooperation on a range of shared priority issues impacting the Blue Pacific region, especially on the need for urgent and ambitious action to address climate change and disaster risk.
8. We acknowledge and respect the Pacific Islands Forum as the apex of the Pacific regional architecture and the driver of regional priority setting and resource allocation, and fully support the Blue Pacific Principles for Dialogue and Engagement. We intend to continue working through and in support of Pacific regional institutions and mechanisms, including the Council of Regional Organizations of the Pacific to advance the shared objectives outlined in the 2050 Strategy and the 2050 Strategy Implementation Plan. We acknowledge the United States' commitment to support Pacific priorities working with other partners.
9. We recognise the importance of enduring partnerships and cooperation and welcome further opportunities to strengthen reciprocal diplomatic representation, and noted the Leaders decision in 2023 to consider the establishment and operationalisation of a permanent Pacific Islands Forum Special Envoy Office in the United States of America, to manage coordination with the United Nations as well as Washington.
10. Recognising the value of public-private partnerships, we look forward to opportunities to convene the Pacific with U.S. businesses with the primary purpose of building investment partnerships, fostering innovation and technology, clean energy transformation, and entrepreneurship, and propelling progress in critical sectors.
Climate Change and Disasters 
11. We recognise that climate change is the single greatest existential threat facing the Blue Pacific, and we acknowledge the climate crisis that threatens the livelihoods, security and wellbeing of its people and ecosystems, recognising that Pacific Islands Forum Leaders have declared that the Pacific region is in a state of climate emergency.
12. We are redoubling efforts to promote and accelerate greater global ambition on climate action to limit the increase in global average temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius, and in this regard, emphasize the importance of both meaningful mitigation action, particularly from major emitters, and international financial support for meaningful mitigation action.
13. We commend the Pacific region for the development of the Pacific designed, led and owned regional financing initiative through the Pacific Resilience Facility (PRF). We welcome the United States' announcement to support the establishment of the PRF with initial funding of $2 million.
14. We underscore the importance of continued efforts to mobilise and simplify the process for timely access to finance to support Pacific Island countries' climate priorities, including through steps to operationalise the PRF.
15. We acknowledge the importance of further developing vulnerability measures, and considering such metrics in relevant international processes, including the potential use of a multidimensional vulnerability index, as criteria to access concessional finance. International institutions may consider incorporating the MVI into their assessment processes, where appropriate.
16. We stress the importance of continuing to strengthen disaster preparedness and response capacities in the Pacific to save lives and livelihoods when threatened by climate change and disaster risks. We recognise ongoing efforts to develop a Pacific Humanitarian Response Coordination Mechanism and welcome the support for the Pacific Humanitarian Warehousing capacities, to improve coordination and the efficiency of regional and national disaster response efforts.
17. We support the robust implementation of the Early Warnings for All initiative and its ambition to ensure that all Pacific people are protected from hazardous weather, water, and climate events through life-saving multi-hazard early warning systems, sharing lessons learned and supporting the Weather Ready Pacific Decadal Programme of Investment.
18. We will prioritize strengthening climate resilience in order to safeguard the wellbeing of populations, ecosystems, and economies against climate risk and continue to promote regional stability. We look to enhance climate adaptation by supporting the fresh water, sanitation, and hygiene sectors, strengthening food systems, expand agricultural, forestry, and infrastructure resilience through increasing climate-smart programming, better designs, and construction, combatting invasive species, and fostering regional collaboration to enhance climate resilience in the Blue Pacific region.
19. Consistent with the mandate from the 27th UN Climate Change Conference, we are committed to operationalizing loss and damage funding arrangements and in this context establishing a fund for responding to loss and damage whose mandate includes a focus on addressing loss and damage. We are working together to design an effective fund that assists developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change, including the Pacific Islands, respond to loss and damage in a way that supports country ownership and national solutions and programs that can respond flexibly to the evolving impacts of climate change.
Ocean and Fisheries 
20. We support the sustainable, inclusive, and equitable management and development of fisheries and other coastal and marine ecosystems and resources, which are essential to Pacific economies and food security.
21. We strive to enhance cooperation to understand, protect, safeguard, and conserve the health and sustainability of the Pacific Ocean and its resources, upon which our nations depend. We endeavor to sustainably manage our ocean resources, including fisheries, to optimize the benefits for the Pacific peoples.
22. We commit to securing the limits of the Blue Pacific Continent to promote the stability, security, certainty, and predictability of maritime entitlements irrespective of the impacts of climate change-related sea-level rise. Bearing in mind the Pacific Islands Forum Declaration on Preserving Maritime Zones in the Face of Climate Change-Related Sea-Level Rise, the United States will work with Pacific Island States and other countries toward the goal of lawfully establishing and maintaining baselines and outer limits of maritime zones and will not challenge such baselines and outer limits irrespective of the impacts of climate change-related sea-level rise.
23. We recognize the rights and entitlements of all States under the international law of the sea as reflected in United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and underscore the importance of compliance with international law, highlighting those obligations relating to protecting and preserving the marine environment.
24. We acknowledge the current work of the International Law Commission Study Group on sea-level rise in relation to international law, on issues relating to statehood and the protection of persons affected by sea-level rise. We are committed to working with each other and others on issues related to climate change-related sea-level rise and statehood.
25. We commit to working together to ensure the Agreement under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Marine Biological Diversity of Areas beyond National Jurisdiction secures the ratifications needed to enter into force as soon as possible.
Trade and Investment 
26. Through regular engagement under the U.S. Pacific Islands Trade and Investment Dialogue, we plan to continue to work together to promote new trade and investment opportunities and deepen trade ties, with a view toward creating durable trade relationships that advance sustainable and inclusive growth, including through discussions on enhanced access to finance for small and medium enterprises, improved business-enabling environments, correspondent banking access, and trade capacity.
27. We look forward to the prospect of the WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies entering into force by the 13th Ministerial Conference, and to its full implementation. To this end, we intend to work towards our respective acceptance of the Agreement, as necessary, and to accelerate progress toward the conclusion of negotiations to achieve a comprehensive agreement on fisheries subsidies, including through disciplines on certain forms of fisheries subsidies that contribute to overcapacity and overfishing, recognizing that appropriate and effective special and differential treatment for developing country members and least developed country Members should be an integral part of these negotiations.
28. We recognise that the Pacific Islands value the benefits offered by the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program and support the U.S. Congress' efforts to reauthorize the GSP.
29. We recognise the Pacific region's efforts to secure aid for trade to achieve its development aspirations and will work towards supporting components of the implementation of the Pacific Aid for Trade Strategy 2020-2025.
30. We plan to invest in safe and secure communications and access to information, through appropriate technology infrastructure and cybersecurity arrangements to enable business, education, and digital connectivity for Pacific peoples.
31. We welcome the progress made towards completing negotiations related to the Annexes of the Treaty on Fisheries between the Governments of Certain Pacific Island States and the Government of the United States of America (""South Pacific Tuna Treaty"") and the conclusion of negotiations on its related Economic Assistance Agreement, which has long served as a cornerstone for U.S-Pacific cooperation.
Peace & Security
32. We reaffirm our commitment to the Boe Declaration and working to address human security, environmental and resource security, transnational crime and cybersecurity.
33. We intend to work together on key law enforcement and justice sector challenges through new capacity building and operational efforts to promote the rule of law; strengthen border security and maritime law enforcement, including to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing; and tackle money laundering, cyber and financial crime, transnational organized crime, and the trafficking of humans, narcotics, and wildlife. We support strengthening institutional capacity to deter and disrupt all forms of corruption and support efforts by Pacific Islands Forum members to uphold and implement the commitments of the Teieniwa Vision and its implementation plan.
34. We seek to strengthen longstanding cooperation on combating illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing through new capacity building and technological initiatives, to supplement our existing bilateral agreements and regional arrangements in collaboration with the Forum Fisheries Agency.
35. We seek to strengthen national and regional good governance and democratic institutions across the Pacific, including through support for accountability, transparency, anti-corruption, civil society, human rights, and an independent and free media environment.
36. We are concerned that the climate crisis may exacerbate threats to international peace and security and worsen risks of current and future conflict and fragility. In this context, we urge the UN Secretary-General to consider appointing a Special Representative for Climate and Security.
People-Centered Development 
37. We commit to promoting inclusive, sustainable, and equitable development, including for women, children, youth, persons with disabilities, and members of marginalized racial, ethnic and Indigenous communities, so that no one is left behind.
38. We reaffirm a commitment to gender equality and social inclusion including the Pacific Leaders Gender Equality Declaration, recognising that no country can thrive if most vulnerable communities and marginalised groups are left behind.
39. We intend to promote regional health and health security, including through new Global Health Security partnerships, and build capacity to combat communicable and noncommunicable diseases, mindful of a One Health approach, so Pacific peoples can live long and healthy lives.
40. We intend to expand our longstanding people-to-people ties through increased training, capacity building and exchange programs, scholarships, diaspora outreach, sports diplomacy, cultural exchange promotion, such as the 13th Festival of Pacific Arts and Culture in 2024 hosted by Hawai'i and implementing new initiatives such as Sister City Partnerships. We intend to promote youth volunteer service across the region including through the return of the Peace Corps to the Pacific.
41. Above all, we reaffirm our commitment to translating our shared vision into common actions to ensure the continued growth, dynamism, resilience, inclusivity and stability of the people of the Blue Pacific Continent.
42. This statement is made in respect of the competences of the signatories and of the respective governments.

Joe Biden,"September 30, 2023",Statement on Congressional Passage of a Continuing Resolution To Fund Federal Government Operations,"Tonight bipartisan majorities in the House and Senate voted to keep the Government open, preventing an unnecessary crisis that would have inflicted needless pain on millions of hard-working Americans. This bill ensures that Active Duty troops will continue to get paid, travelers will be spared airport delays, millions of women and children will continue to have access to vital nutrition assistance, and so much more. This is good news for the American people.
But I want to be clear: We should never have been in this position in the first place. Just a few months ago, Speaker McCarthy and I reached a budget agreement to avoid precisely this type of manufactured crisis. For weeks, extreme House Republicans tried to walk away from that deal by demanding drastic cuts that would have been devastating for millions of Americans. They failed.
While the Speaker and the overwhelming majority of Congress have been steadfast in their support for Ukraine, there is no new funding in this agreement to continue that support. We cannot under any circumstances allow American support for Ukraine to be interrupted. I fully expect the Speaker will keep his commitment to the people of Ukraine and secure passage of the support needed to help Ukraine at this critical moment.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-congressional-passage-continuing-resolution-fund-federal-government-operations
Joe Biden,"October 06, 2023",Joint Statement by President Biden and President Frank-Walter Steinmeier of Germany on German-American Day,"President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. welcomed President Frank-Walter Steinmeier of Germany to the White House on October 6, 2023, to mark the occasion of German-American Day. The presidents underscored the strong ties between our countries and our people, including the over 40 million Americans who claim German heritage and strengthen the diverse fabric of the United States.
The American dream lived in the hearts of German immigrants long before the United States was founded. Since 1683, the story of German-Americans has been inextricable from the story of America: German-Americans fought in the Revolutionary War; members of the Continental Congress were known to have gathered and debated in German coffeehouses; a local German newspaper was the first to print the Declaration of Independence; and so much more. Generations after these trailblazers, Americans came to help Europe. They joined the Allies to free Europe from Nazi terror, gave Germany a new chance for freedom and prosperity with the Marshall Plan, and helped tear down the Berlin Wall. German-Americans continue to strengthen the United States' values and culture as leaders in every sector and community. Today's united and democratic Germany is unthinkable without the courage of Americans.
Building on our shared history, common values, and work together as NATO Allies, our partnership is essential to our efforts to address global challenges, from climate change and food insecurity to the defense of human rights and democracy. And our alliance is critical for our continuing efforts to support the people of Ukraine and their courageous defense of their country, their freedom, and their future.
On German-American Day, 340 years after German immigrants founded Germantown in Pennsylvania, President Biden and President Steinmeier celebrated the incredible legacy of millions of German-Americans and the unbreakable bonds of friendship between our two countries.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/joint-statement-president-biden-and-president-frank-walter-steinmeier-germany-german
Joe Biden,"October 15, 2023","Interview with Scott Pelley of CBS News ""60 Minutes""","THE PRESIDENT: I'm saying we're gonna do everything in our power to find those who are still alive and set them free. Everything in our power. And-- I'm not gonna go into the detail of that, but there's-- we're workin' like hell on it.
PELLEY: Why do you feel so strongly about speaking to these families personally on Zoom?
THE PRESIDENT: Because I think they have to know that the president of the United States of America cares deeply about what's happening. Deeply. We have to communicate to the world this is critical. this is not even hum-- human behavior. It's-- it-- it-- it's-- it's-- it's pure barbarism. And we're gonna do everything in our power to get them home if we can find them.
PELLEY: Is getting the American hostages back safely among your highest priorities now?
THE PRESIDENT: Of course, it is. But it's hard to-- hard to make distinctions. It's-- most important thing is ending this brutality and to hold those who committed it accountable.
PELLEY: Can you foresee U.S. troops in combat in this new Middle East war?
THE PRESIDENT: I-- I don't think that's necessary. Israel has one of the finest fighting forces in the country. I guarantee we're gonna provide them everything they need.
PELLEY: Because of what we're seeing in the Middle East, is the threat of terrorism in the United States increased?
THE PRESIDENT: Yes. I had a meeting this morning with the Homeland Security people, with the FBI, with-- for the Situation Room, for the better part of an hour to discuss how we make sure that we prevent a lone wolf and/or any cohi-- coordinated effort to try to do what was done in synagogues before, do what was done to Jews in the street. we're making a major effort to make sure that doesn't happen.
PELLEY: Certainly, about 1,200 Israeli civilians were killed in the initial attack, but now Hamas fighters and Palestinian civilians are being killed in the counterattack. Is it time for a ceasefire?
THE PRESIDENT: Look, there's a fundamental difference. Israel is going after a group of people who have engaged in barbarism that is as consequential as the Holocaust. And-- so I think Israel has to respond. They have to go after Hamas. Hamas is a bunch of cowards. They're hiding behind the civilians. They put their of—their—their—their headquarters where civilians are and buildings and the like. But to the extent they can separate out and avoi—I'm conf-- the Israelis are gonna do everything in their power to avoid the killing of innocent civilians.
Hamas is an Islamist terrorist group and the government of Gaza. Gaza is 25 miles long and averages 5 miles wide. Israel severely limits its economy so most Gazans are destitute. Now, Israel has cut off food, fuel, electricity and most water, and has ordered 1 million Gazans to evacuate to the southern half of Gaza. The U.N. warns of a humanitarian disaster.
PELLEY: There are about 2 million people in Gaza, as you know, Mr. President, 2 million people trapped. About half of them are children. Are you asking Israel to establish a humanitarian corridor in that area or get humanitarian supplies into it?
THE PRESIDENT: Yes, our team is talkin' to 'em about that. And-- whether there could be a safe zone. We're also talking to Egyptians-- whether there is an outlet to get these children and-- and women out--- into---out of that a that area at this moment. But it's-- it's c-- hard.
PELLEY: You would like to see a humanitarian corridor that allows some of the 2 million Gazans out of the area?
THE PRESIDENT: Yes.
PELLEY: You would like to see humanitarian supplies brought into Gaza?
THE PRESIDENT: Yes.
PELLEY: So you do not agree with the Israeli total siege of the Gaza Strip?
THE PRESIDENT: I'm confident that Israel is going to act under the measure-- the-- the rules of war. There-- there's-- standards that democratic institutions and countries w-- go-- go by. And so-- I'm-- I-- I'm confident that there's gonna be an ability for the innocents in Gaza to be able to have access to medicine and food and water. 
PELLEY: Would you support Israeli occupation of Gaza at this point?
THE PRESIDENT: I think it'd be a big mistake. Look, what happened in Gaza, in my view, is Hamas and the extreme elements of Hamas don't represent all the Palestinian people. And I think that...It would be a mistake to...for Israel to occupy...Gaza again. We...but going in but taking out the extremists the Hezbollah is up north but Hamas down south. Is a necessary requirement.
PELLEY: Do you believe that Hamas must be eliminated entirely?
THE PRESIDENT: Yes, I do. But there needs to be a Palestinian authority. There needs to be a path to a Palestinian state.
That path, called ""the two state solution,"" has been U.S. policy for decades. It would create an independent nation next to Israel for 5 million Palestinians who live in Gaza and on the West Bank of the Jordan River. 
PELLEY: And you believe Israel would pursue that after what's occurred--
THE PRESIDENT: Not now. Not now. Not now, but-- but I think Israel understands that a significant portion of Palestinian people do not share the views of Hamas and Hezbollah.
Hezbollah is a powerful Islamist militia to Israel's north which is armed and trained by Iran. Iran also supports Hamas. 
PELLEY: There's limited fighting already on the northern Israeli border, and I wonder what is your message to Hezbollah and its backer, Iran?
THE PRESIDENT: Don't. Don't, don't, don't.
PELLEY: Don't come across the border? Don't escalate this war?
THE PRESIDENT: That's right.
PELLEY: Is Iran behind the Gaza war?
President Biden: I don't wanna get into classified information. But to be very blunt with you, there is no clear evidence of that.
PELLEY: At this point, no evidence that Iran is behind any of this?
THE PRESIDENT: Correct. Now, Iran constantly supports Hamas and Hezbollah. I don't mean that. But in terms of were they-- w-- did they have foreknowledge; did they help plan the attack-- the-- there's-- there's no evidence of that at this point.
The president is asking for billions of dollars for Israel and Ukraine. But Congress is paralyzed. Hard-right Republicans are obstructing the election of a speaker of the house.
PELLEY: Does the dysfunction that we've seen in Congress increase the danger in the world?
THE PRESIDENT: Yes. Look, this is not your father's Republican Party. Thirty percent of it's made up of these MAGA Republicans who are maybe-- democracy is something I don't-- they don't look at the same way you and I look at democracy.
PELLEY: Are the wars in Israel and Ukraine more than the United States can take on at the same time?
THE PRESIDENT: No. We're the United States of America for God's sake, the most powerful nation in the history-- not in the world, in the history of the world. The history of the world. We can take care of both of these and still maintain our overall international defense.
Russia's unprovoked invasion occupies nearly 20% of Ukraine. Hundreds of thousands have been killed or wounded. In an interview last month, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told us he could lose without U.S. aid. 
PELLEY: How do these wars in Israel and Ukraine relate to the safety of the American people?
THE PRESIDENT: Overwhelmingly, they relate. For example, in Ukraine one of my objectives was to prevent Putin, who has committed war crimes himself, who-- from bein' able to occupy an independent country that borders NATO allies and is on the Russian border. Imagine what happens now if he were able to succeed. Have you ever known a major war in Europe we didn't get sucked into? We don't want that to happen. We want to make sure those democracies are sustained. And Ukraine is critical in making sure that happens.
Mr. Biden told us images of October 7th reminded him of the Holocaust—which he has studied-- taking his family to the Dachau death camp in Germany. This is 2015, the man in the wheelchair is a Dachau survivor. Behind Mr. Biden is the president's granddaughter. 
THE PRESIDENT: I want my children and grandchildren to fully understand exactly what happened and why you couldn't deny the carnage going on if you were living in Germany and in Europe.  
PELLEY: Why do you feel so strongly? What does Israel mean to you?
THE PRESIDENT: The Jews have been subject to abuse, prejudice, and-- and-- attempt to wipe them out for, oh, God, over a th-- thousand years. For me, it's about decency, respect, honor. it's just simply wrong. Wrong, wrong, wrong. It violates every religious principle I have and every way-- and every single principle my father taught me.
As we spoke to the president, his secretary of state was in Israel, his secretary of defense was in a NATO meeting on Ukraine. America's oldest president seemed tired from directing all of this. But he was very clear on what he stood for and how his policies, in his view, would see America through. 
PELLEY: Mr. President, given these two wars and the dysfunction in Congress, are you sure that you want to run again?
THE PRESIDENT: Yes ..because.. I'm sure. Look, when I ran, I said, ""The world's at an inflection point."" The world's changing, but we have an opportunity to make it-- so, imagine if we were able to succeed in getting the Middle East put in place where we have normalization of relations. I think we can do that. Imagine what happens if we, in fact, unite all of Europe and Putin is finally put down where he cannot cause the kind of trouble he's been causing. We have enormous opportunities, enormous opportunities to make it a better world.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-scott-pelley-cbs-news-60-minutes-0
Joe Biden,"October 20, 2023","Joint Statement by President Biden, President Charles Yvon Michel of the European Council, and President Ursula von der Leyen of the European Commission","1. The United States and the European Union and its Member States, representing nearly 800 million citizens, united by our values and bound together by the most dynamic economic relationship on earth, reaffirm our commitment to a transatlantic partnership that delivers for all our people. Since the last U.S.-EU Summit in June 2021, the world has changed in unprecedented ways, and we have taken ambitious steps in response. Together, we are working to secure peace, stability, and prosperity regionally and across the world, including in our steadfast support for Ukraine. We are deepening our cooperation to reflect the pressing challenges and opportunities of our time—strengthening our economic security; advancing reliable, sustainable, affordable, and secure energy transitions in our economies and globally; reinforcing multilateralism and international cooperation; and harnessing digital technologies to work for, not against, our shared values of democracy and respect for human rights and the rule of law. We are more united than ever.
A. TOWARD A MORE SECURE AND STABLE WORLD 
Situation in the Middle East 
2. We condemn in the strongest possible terms Hamas and its brutal terrorist attacks across Israel. There is no justification for terrorism. We affirm Israel's right to defend itself against these heinous attacks, in line with international law, including international humanitarian law. We will work closely with partners in the region to stress the importance of protecting civilians, supporting those who are trying to get to safety or provide assistance, and facilitating access to food, water, medical care, and shelter. We are concerned by the deteriorating humanitarian crisis in Gaza. It is crucial to prevent regional escalation. We call for the immediate release of all hostages and emphasize our shared view that a two-state solution remains the viable path to lasting peace
Russia's War against Ukraine and Support for Regional Stability 
3. The United States and the European Union remain unwavering in our long-term political, financial, humanitarian, and military support to Ukraine and its people as they defend themselves against Russia's illegal and unprovoked war of aggression. We stand together in calling for Russia to end its brutal war and to withdraw its military forces and proxies and military equipment immediately, completely, and unconditionally from the entire internationally recognized territory of Ukraine. We are committed to achieving the widest possible international support for the key principles and objectives of Ukraine's Peace Formula. Any initiative for a comprehensive, just, and lasting peace in Ukraine must be based on full respect for Ukraine's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity, within its internationally recognized borders and uphold all the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter.
4. We are committed to supporting Ukraine for as long as it takes to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity. We recognize the urgency of ensuring that Russia does not succeed in collapsing the Ukrainian economy and of intensifying our efforts to help ensure assistance meets Ukraine's highest priority needs. As co-chairs, along with Ukraine, of the Multi-agency Donor Coordination Platform, we are working together with Ukraine as it develops its Ukraine Plan, embedded in its European path, to incorporate a common set of near-term priority economic, rule-of-law, and democratization reforms and a prioritized and well-coordinated approach to recovery and reconstruction assistance and investment. The United States and the European Union, together with other international donors, will continue to provide Ukraine with financing to help achieve these objectives, including to defend, repair, and rebuild its energy sector aligned with EU standards. We acknowledge Ukraine's commitment and progress in their reform efforts, and underline the strategic importance of its EU accession process.
5. Russia must cease its aggression and must bear the legal consequences of all its internationally wrongful acts, including compensation for the damage caused to Ukraine. We are united in our determination to ensure full accountability. In light of the urgency of disrupting Russia's attempts to destroy the Ukrainian economy and Russia's continued failure to abide by its international law obligations, the United States and the European Union, together with our allies, are convening our experts to explore options to compensate Ukraine in a timely manner for the loss, injury, and damage resulting from Russia's aggression. We are exploring all possible avenues to aid Ukraine, consistent with our respective legal systems and international law. We are also working together with the global community to address the energy, economic, and food security challenges caused by Russia's war of choice, which are particularly acute in the most vulnerable developing countries. We condemn Russia's attempts to block food exports and its attacks on Ukraine's grain storage and shipment facilities since its withdrawal from the Black Sea Grain Initiative. The EU's Solidarity Lanes remain instrumental in bolstering global food security.
6. As part of our efforts to aid Ukraine, in the short term, we will explore how any extraordinary revenues held by private entities stemming directly from immobilized Russian sovereign assets, where those extraordinary revenues are not required to meet obligations towards Russia under applicable laws, could be directed to support Ukraine and its recovery and reconstruction in compliance with applicable laws.
7. We will deepen our joint work to undermine Russia's ability to wage its war, and maintain and expand its defense industrial base and capacity. Those who help Russia acquire items or equipment for its defense industrial base are supporting actions which undermine the territorial integrity, sovereignty, and independence of Ukraine. This includes companies supplying certain critical raw materials and high-priority items to Russia, as well as the financial institutions and other entities facilitating such transfers. We will target third-country actors who materially support Russia's war. We will continue to vigorously and jointly enforce our sanctions and export control measures to disrupt circumvention and backfill. Our joint implementation of the G7+ price cap for seaborne Russian-origin crude oil and petroleum products supports energy market stability while diminishing Russia's ability to finance its illegal war. We intend to act, consistent with our respective legal authorities, where we have evidence indicating violations or deceptive practices related to the price cap policy.
8. We reaffirm our support for the Republic of Moldova's territorial integrity and sovereignty. The European Council decided in June to grant the status of candidate country to the Republic of Moldova. We will continue to support Moldova in addressing the challenges it faces as a consequence of the Russian aggression against Ukraine and in reform efforts on its European path. We remain fully committed to supporting Georgia's territorial integrity and sovereignty, and its European perspective. We reaffirm our shared commitment to stability in the Western Balkans and our support to the EU perspective of the region. All partners should continue making the reforms required to progress on their European path. We note the need for Kosovo and Serbia to urgently de-escalate tensions and to swiftly and unconditionally implement the agreement on the path to normalization of their relations and return to the EU-facilitated Dialogue. We remain committed to advancing a lasting peace between Armenia and Azerbaijan based on mutual recognition of sovereignty, inviolability of borders and territorial integrity. We urge Azerbaijan to ensure the rights and security of those who remain in Nagorno-Karabakh as well as for those who wish to return to their homes. We also call for all parties to adhere to the principle of non-use of force and threat of use of force.
Africa 
9. The United States and the European Union share a common interest in a thriving, peaceful, democratic, and resilient Africa, and welcome the accession of the African Union as a permanent member of the G20. We will work together to continue to enhance synergies in our cooperation with all our African partners. We are committed to promoting the security, stability and prosperity of North Africa. We reaffirm our commitment to tackle common security challenges in the Sahel, including the fight against terrorism, in cooperation with ECOWAS.
Partnerships in the Indo-Pacific 
10. We reiterate our shared commitment to enhancing coordination and cooperation in support of a free and open Indo-Pacific with the aim of contributing to the stability, security, prosperity and sustainable development of the region, based on the promotion of democracy, rule of law, human rights and international law. Consistent with our respective Indo-Pacific strategies, we will seek opportunities to enhance practical cooperation in the Indo-Pacific, including through the biannual U.S.-EU Indo-Pacific Consultations. This includes expanding maritime domain awareness, encouraging cooperation on connectivity, responding to foreign information manipulation and interference, increasing coordination on cyber cooperation, and encouraging ongoing efforts to uphold fundamental freedoms and human rights. We reaffirm our unwavering support for ASEAN centrality and unity and our commitment to promoting cooperation in line with the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific. We also reaffirm our partnership with Pacific Island countries and reiterate the importance of supporting their priorities and needs in accordance with the Pacific Islands Forum's 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent.
11. We reiterate our support for international law, in particular as reflected in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), and for the peaceful settlement of disputes in accordance with international law, including under UNCLOS dispute settlement mechanisms.
China 
12. The United States and European Union recall our discussions in other fora, including the G7, on the principles that underpin our relations with China. We stand prepared to build constructive and stable relations with China, recognizing the importance of engaging candidly with and expressing our concerns directly to China. It is necessary to cooperate with China, given its role in the international community and the size of its economy, on global challenges as well as areas of common interest. We call on China to engage with us, including in international fora, on areas such as the climate and biodiversity crisis, addressing vulnerable countries' debt sustainability and financing needs, global health and pandemic preparedness, and macroeconomic stability.
13. With a view to enabling sustainable economic relations with China, we will push for a level playing field for our firms and workers. We are not decoupling or turning inwards. At the same time, we recognize that economic resilience requires de-risking and diversifying. In this context, we will invest in our own economic vibrancy and reduce critical dependencies and vulnerabilities, including in our supply chains. We also recognize the necessity of protecting certain advanced technologies that could be used to threaten global peace and security, without unduly limiting trade and investment. We will foster resilience to economic coercion. We will address challenges posed by non-market policies and practices.
14. We remain seriously concerned about the situation in the East and South China Seas and strongly oppose any unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force or coercion. We underscore the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, and encourage the peaceful resolution of cross-Strait issues. There is no change in the one China policy of the United States or of the European Union.
15. We will keep voicing our concerns about the human rights and forced labor in China, including in Tibet and Xinjiang. With respect to Hong Kong, we call on China to honor its previous commitments with respect to Hong Kong under the Sino-Joint Declaration and the Basic Law.
16. We call on China to press Russia to stop its war of aggression, and immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw its troops from Ukraine. We encourage China to support a comprehensive, just and lasting peace based on territorial integrity and the principles and purposes of the UN Charter, including through its direct dialogue with Ukraine.
Strengthening Cooperation on Security and Defense 
17. We will further strengthen and deepen EU-U.S. cooperation and engagement on security and defense. This could include enhancing practical cooperation in operational theatres of mutual interest. NATO remains the foundation of collective defense for its Allies and essential for Euro Atlantic security. We recognize the value of a stronger and more capable European defense that contributes positively to global and transatlantic security and is complementary to, and interoperable with NATO. We welcome the signature of the Administrative Arrangement between the United States Department of Defense and the European Defense Agency.
Partnering with Emerging Economies and Developing Countries 
18. The United States and the European Union are committed to accelerating progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals and to mobilizing additional financing for development. To this end, we are committed to advancing reforms for better, bigger, and more effective multilateral development banks to address global challenges and countries' core development needs. This includes the implementation of critical financial reforms and a review of the climate finance architecture to make it more effective and efficient. We commit to raising the level of ambition to deliver more headroom and concessional finance to boost the World Bank's capacity to support low- and middle-income countries addressing global challenges, with a clear framework for the allocation of scarce concessional resources, and to provide strong support for the poorest countries. The United States and the European Union will step up efforts to deliver substantial contributions to this end.
19. Given the massive scale of need, greater private capital mobilization must play a significant role in meeting our objectives. We will continue to champion efforts to unlock private capital and will work with G7 partners through respective actions, to scale the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, including the European Union's Global Gateway strategy, and mobilize $600 billion in quality infrastructure investments in low- and middle-income countries by 2027. Building on the discussions on U.S.-EU collaboration on the Trans-African Corridor and the India-Middle East-Europe Corridor, we are working towards identifying additional regional economic corridors to cooperate on to unlock inclusive and sustainable economic growth.
20. The United States and the European Union will also continue their efforts to promote digital inclusion and trustworthy information and communication technology and services supply chains around the world and pursue cooperation to develop a common vision and industry roadmap on research and development for 6G wireless communication systems.
B. STRENGTHENED U.S.-EU ECONOMIC COOPERATION 
21. The U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council (TTC) is the key forum for our cooperation on trade and technology matters. We commend the progress made and encourage advancing joint work in the run up to the upcoming TTC ministerial meeting later in 2023.
22. The United States and the European Union are committed to strengthening the transatlantic marketplace to support decent jobs and economic opportunities with an emphasis on mutually beneficial resilience and sustainability of our supply chains. We will advance the implementation of the Transatlantic Initiative on Sustainable Trade focusing on facilitating mutually beneficial trade across the Atlantic of products and technologies that underpin the transition to a climate-neutral economy.
Building the Sustainable and Resilient Economies of the Future 
23. The United States and the European Union are deepening our collaboration to address the urgent and interdependent crises of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution, and urge ambitious action by all other major players. We will work expeditiously to implement the Paris Agreement, halt and reverse the loss of biodiversity globally and protect the ocean. We will intensify our outreach to third countries, notably in view of the 28th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP28), making every effort to keep a 1.5 degree Celsius limit on global temperature warming within reach. We are committed to working together and with others for COP28 to reach bold commitments to dramatically increase global renewable energy capacity and energy efficiency while supporting a global shift away from unabated fossil fuels, including an end to new unabated coal fired power plants. We will continue to lead efforts to cut methane to support achieving the Global Methane Pledge and look forward to a robust Methane Finance Sprint announcement at COP28.
24. Together, we will work to build climate neutral, circular, resource efficient and resilient economies, to promote internationally recognized labor rights, and to improve the resilience and sustainability of critical supply chains. We will continue our work to advance the energy transition to climate neutrality and bolster energy security through the Joint Energy Security Task Force and U.S.-EU Energy Council.
25. We are making bold public investments in our respective economies, and will continue to also expand research collaboration, to ignite a clean industrial revolution and, with it, good jobs, and make our industries more sustainable and competitive. We will continue ongoing cooperation toward this end, and work openly and transparently against zero-sum competition to maximize clean energy deployment, including through our Clean Energy Incentives Dialogue.
26. We have made progress toward a targeted critical minerals agreement for the purpose of expanding access to sustainable, secure, and diversified high-standard critical mineral and battery supply chains and enabling those minerals extracted or processed in the European Union to count toward requirements for clean vehicles in the Section 30D clean vehicle tax credit of the Inflation Reduction Act. We look forward to continuing to make progress and consulting with our respective stakeholders on these negotiations in the coming weeks.
Expanding Technology Cooperation and Exchanges 
27. The United States and the European Union are stepping up our joint efforts to promote an open, free, global, interoperable, reliable, secure, innovative, and competitive digital ecosystem. We are cooperating to manage the risks and harness the benefits of artificial intelligence (AI), working alongside our partners in the G7, OECD, and other multilateral fora. We affirm our continued work through the TTC Joint Roadmap on Trustworthy AI and Risk Management to further guide the development of tools, methodologies, and approaches to AI risk management and trustworthy AI. We confirm our joint intention to endorse a code of conduct for organizations developing advanced AI systems as part of the G7 Hiroshima process in the near term. We confirm our commitment to use AI for Public Good, particularly in the areas of agriculture, extreme weather prediction, emergency management and response, electric grid optimization, and health and medical research. As new and more advanced AI systems emerge, we plan to build on work done to promote responsible AI and work with industry, civil society, academia, and other stakeholders to enable trustworthy development and uptake of those technologies, and to advance our shared vision of responsible innovation in line with our shared democratic values. We recognize the importance of expanding research collaboration between the European Union and the United States for critical and emerging technologies such as AI, quantum, renewable energy, and other key areas, including by enabling transatlantic research funding activities that allow for both U.S. and EU researcher leadership while considering reciprocity in access to respective U.S. and EU research programs and ensuring symmetry in managing intellectual property. We commit to working together to finalize an agreement on quantum-related items for the upcoming TTC meetings.
28. We aim to build a more secure cyberspace together. We endeavor to cooperate to promote high cybersecurity standards to protect consumers and business and decrease vulnerability to cyberattacks. To that end, we commit to work together on achieving mutual recognition for our government-backed cybersecurity labeling programs and regulations for Internet-of-things devices aiming at a Joint CyberSafe Products Action Plan. We will work for consumers in Europe and the United States to have an easy and reliable way to assess whether devices they bring into their homes, offices, and schools are secure.
Promoting Rules-Based Trade and Countering Unfair Competition 
29. The United States and the European Union have a shared interest in reforming the WTO so that Members can better achieve the WTO's foundational objectives and address modern-day imperatives. We will work towards substantial WTO reform by MC13 in 2024 including by conducting discussions with the view to having a fully and well-functioning dispute settlement system accessible to all WTO Members by 2024.
30. On 31 October 2021, we announced that we would negotiate within two years an arrangement—known as the Global Arrangement on Sustainable Steel and Aluminum (Global Arrangement)—to address non-market excess capacity and emissions intensity of the steel and aluminum industries, including to foster undistorted transatlantic trade. Throughout these two years, we have made substantial progress to identify the sources of non-market excess capacity. We have also achieved a better understanding of the tools to address the emissions intensity of the steel and aluminum industries. We look forward to continuing to make progress on these important objectives in the next two months.
Strengthening Economic Resilience and Economic Security 
31. The United States and the European Union are continuing to cooperate to enhance the resilience of our economies and advance our economic security interests, underpinned by a rules-based system, while preserving an open economy and a global level playing field. We will de-risk and diversify where we assess there are risks through proportionate, precise and targeted measures to address economic security challenges. We will continue working together to reduce excessive dependencies in critical supply chains, in close cooperation with partner countries. We share concerns about the challenges posed by, among other issues, economic coercion, the weaponization of economic dependencies, and non-market policies and practices. We will continue this work through inter alia the TTC, and with the G7 and other partners to diversify our supply chains and increase our collective preparedness, assessment, deterrence, and response to economic coercion.
32. We have a shared interest in protecting those advanced technologies that could be used to undermine global peace and security, and are developing our respective economic security toolkits to ensure our companies' capital, expertise, and innovations will not be used to do so. Recognizing that outbound investment measures are necessary to complement its existing economic security toolkit, the President of the United States has issued an Executive Order to address risks from outbound investment and is consulting stakeholders on the U.S. rules. The European Union and its Member States are similarly exploring, based on a risk assessment, whether outbound investment measures could complement its existing toolkit. Export control regimes are central to maintain international security and stability, and necessitate cooperation between actors—including in multilateral fora—to ensure our dual-use technology protection ecosystem is continuously improved upon and cannot be exploited. We will cooperate and share lessons as we work to maximize the effectiveness of our economic security toolkit to achieve our shared interest.
33. Foreign information manipulation and interference is a borderless threat that poses a risk to democratic values, processes, and stability. We will expand collaboration based on common principles, such as dedicated strategies, internal organizational structures, capacity, civil society and multilateral engagement. This cooperation should aim to support like-minded partners in countering foreign information manipulation and interference, including via U.S. and EU coordinated activities, while safeguarding freedom of expression together with partner countries.
Expanding People-to-People Contacts 
34. To preserve the strength and longevity of our transatlantic relationship, the United States and the European Union also endeavour to increase vital people-to-people exchanges. We will work to achieve visa-free travel between all EU Member States and the United States. Together, the United States and the European Union intend to provide additional resources to increase the number of transatlantic academic exchanges. The European Union will increase its funding to the Erasmus+ programme, and will double EU support to the Fulbright-Schuman programme, and across all Fulbright Commissions in EU Member States. The United States plans to increase its funding to all Fulbright Commissions in EU Member States, including the Fulbright-Schuman programme. This collective support will significantly increase the number of transatlantic academic exchanges between our citizens over the next five years.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/joint-statement-president-biden-president-charles-yvon-michel-the-european-council-and
Joe Biden,"October 25, 2023",Joint Statement by President Biden and Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of Australia—Building an Innovation Alliance,"We, President Biden and Prime Minister Albanese, inaugurated a new era of U.S.-Australia strategic cooperation during the Prime Minister's Official Visit and State Dinner in Washington, D.C., today.
Our nations are inseparably linked by our common democratic values and the three pillars of our alliance: defense, economic, and climate and clean energy cooperation. As our alliance cooperation reaches new heights, we are expanding our partnership into new domains to reflect the evolution of our relationship and the growing complexity of global and regional challenges. At the core of our cooperation is a shared commitment to a peaceful, open, stable, and prosperous Indo-Pacific. We reaffirm our commitment to work with Indo-Pacific partners and institutions to respond to shared challenges and ensure a region that is thriving, connected, resilient, and secure. These commitments are based on respect for international law, including as it pertains to the protection and promotion of human rights, and the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states.
Today we announce the pursuit of new areas of cooperation on science and critical and emerging technologies so that we can build an ""Innovation Alliance."" These initiatives will augment and complement our robust economic cooperation and trade; our foundational security and defense ties; our newly inaugurated cooperation on climate, critical minerals, and clean energy; and our enduring people-to-people connections.
Steadfast in these values, we condemn in the strongest possible terms Hamas' heinous terrorist attack on Israel. The terrorist actions of Hamas can have no justification, no legitimacy, and must be universally condemned. We call for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages. Hamas offers nothing but terror and bloodshed. It does not represent the Palestinian people, nor their legitimate needs and aspirations.
Our countries will support Israel as it defends itself and its people against such atrocities. We affirm Israel's inherent right to defend itself. In doing so, in line with the values we share as democracies, we call on all parties to act consistent with the principles of international law and to protect civilians as an utmost priority. We are concerned at the humanitarian situation in Gaza and call on all actors to ensure the provision of humanitarian supplies to populations in need.
Our two countries support equal measures of dignity, freedom, and self-determination for Israelis and Palestinians alike and we mourn every civilian life lost in this conflict. We continue to support Palestinian aspirations for a state of their own and consider a two-state solution as the best avenue towards a lasting peace.
Promoting Advanced Technology and Space Cooperation 
We welcome the announcement of a $3 billion investment in Australia by Microsoft, which will expand the company's data center and Artificial Intelligence (AI) infrastructure in Australia over the next two years, train more than 300,000 Australians with the skills required for a cloud and AI-enabled economy, and create the Microsoft-Australian Signals Directorate Cyber Shield to harden Australia from cyber-threats to individuals, businesses, and governments. We also welcome the close partnership between the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) and Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), including bilateral cooperation through the NSF's Global Centers initiative with up to $16.3 million for climate and clean energy research, and an AI partnership supported by a combined $6.2 million in grants to drive ground-breaking research. Additionally, the development of a Memorandum of Understanding between Los Alamos National Laboratory and the Australian National University intends to strengthen cooperation in research and education between the United States and Australia.
Our focus on innovation also extends to space, where we look forward to tomorrow's signing of a space Technology Safeguards Agreement that creates the potential for new space-related commercial opportunities while providing the legal and technical framework to protect sensitive U.S. space launch technology and data in Australia consistent with our shared non-proliferation goals. We also welcome progress in negotiations of a bilateral space framework agreement, and encourage further joint commercial investment across all sectors, including space situational awareness and commercial space stations.
Building Clean Energy Supply Chains and Addressing the Climate Crisis 
In May, we launched the historic Australia-United States Climate, Critical Minerals, and Clean Energy Transformation Compact (the Compact), which affirmed our shared determination to make climate and clean energy cooperation the third pillar of our alliance and counter the threat to global security and prosperity posed by climate change. We recognize that achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement will require rapid deployment of clean energy and decarbonization technologies, and increased electrification in our countries this decade, alongside the phasedown of unabated coal power.
Under the Compact, we convened the ministerial-level United States-Australia Clean Energy Dialogue between the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and Australia's Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water. As part of our enhanced cooperation, we plan to collaborate on clean energy supply chains with the intent to leverage our comparative advantages and sovereign capabilities, beginning with a battery supply chain working group to explore the deepening of both countries' manufacturing capability and work on battery technology research and development. We also announced our intention for a Memorandum of Understanding between the U.S. DOE Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations and Australian entities. Australia and the U.S. DOE intend to establish the Australia-United States Clean Energy Industry Council, which will draw on the expertise of business and public finance leaders to advise our governments on clean energy industry development and cooperation.
Recognizing that climate change poses the single greatest threat to the livelihoods, security, and wellbeing of people and ecosystems in the Indo-Pacific, we announce today that the United States and Australia are working to jointly develop an Indo-Pacific Net-Zero Transition bond series to mobilize funding for small-medium sized enterprises with a focus on clean energy transition.
The United States and Australia intend to work to enhance access to the resources of the Green Climate Fund, and other relevant multilateral funds, especially for those most vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change, including least developed countries (LDCs) and small island developing states (SIDS). This effort will be advanced, including through targeted bilateral technical assistance from USAID to LDCs and SIDS, and in coordination with DFAT's program of support to Pacific Island countries
Recognizing the central role of critical minerals in the clean energy transformation, we also applaud the successful launch of the U.S.-Australia Critical Minerals Taskforce, led by the U.S. National Security Council in partnership with the U.S. Department of Commerce, and Australia's Department of Industry, Science and Resources. Leveraging the growing economic connections between both countries, the Taskforce identified areas in which the U.S. and Australian Governments can take joint action to increase investment in critical minerals mining and processing projects in our respective countries and enhance market transparency in this sector. A new Memorandum of Understanding between CSIRO and the United States Geological Survey around critical minerals aims to deepen relationships between U.S. and Australian researchers, including on minerals processing.
Prime Minister Albanese reiterated his support for President Biden's request of Congress to add Australia as a ""domestic source"" within the meaning of Title III of the U.S. Defense Production Act, which would streamline technological and industrial base collaboration and build new opportunities for United States investment in the production and purchase of Australian critical minerals, critical technologies, and other strategic sectors. Taken together, these initiatives will further our efforts to build more diverse and resilient supply chains.
Recognizing the imperative to address non-CO2 pollutants as a key driver of global climate change, we intend to continue to take strong action at home on methane mitigation and consider opportunities to support developing countries in the Indo-Pacific with capacity building assistance on methane mitigation. The United States commends Australia's robust action underway at home to address all greenhouse gases, including methane, as demonstrated in its comprehensive reporting of its climate policies and measures in its upcoming climate change statement. Under the Climate Compact, we plan to strengthen our cooperation on non-CO2 gases in the coming years. Together, we are committed to supporting the Montreal Protocol Multilateral Fund's work to enhance support for early action to reduce HFC consumption and for improved energy efficiency for the HCFC phase-out and HFC phase-down in order to maximize the climate benefits of Montreal Protocol implementation.
Advancing Prosperity and Resilience in the Pacific and Southeast Asia 
We are working through existing regional architecture, including the Pacific Islands Forum as the pre-eminent institution for Pacific Island Countries, to help the region meet its needs and aspirations, including as articulated in the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent. Australia welcomes the U.S.-Pacific Islands Forum Summit held in Washington, D.C. last month. Signifying that commitment, today we announce that the United States and Australia plan to co finance critical maritime infrastructure projects in Kiribati, including the rehabilitation of Kanton Wharf and Charlie Wharf in Tarawa.
The U.S. Government, working with the U.S. Congress, and Australia through the Australian Infrastructure Financing Facility for the Pacific, intend to provide $65 million to finance future submarine cable connectivity for Pacific Island countries, to assist access to global markets and realization of regional connectivity goals. We plan to work collaboratively with commercial cable providers Google and Hawaiki Nui, in partnership with Pacific Island countries, to provide branching units for Federated States of Micronesia, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. Building on existing support to the region, this work will position all Pacific Island countries to achieve primary connectivity and for countries with existing access to secure options for critical redundancy.
Together, the United States and Australia will engage Pacific Island nations to develop and deploy a pilot initiative in the region to increase national cyber resilience, to include upgraded data services and cloud-based back-ups. Australia also welcomes the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) announcement at the U.S.-Pacific Islands Forum Summit to launch an up to $50 million Pacific Islands Microfinance Partnership that would facilitate lending for small businesses in the Pacific Islands region.
The United States and Australia remain committed to evolving multilateral development banks to better address global challenges as part of their contribution to reducing poverty, boosting sustainable and inclusive growth, and helping achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. We commit to raising the level of ambition to deliver more headroom and concessional finance to boost the World Bank's capacity to support low- and middle-income countries in addressing global challenges and to provide strong support for the poorest countries. The United States and Australia will step up efforts to this end. Both countries continue to cooperate through the World Bank and Asian Development Bank to promote transparent, high-quality investment, including use of competitive procurement focused on value for money and strong development outcomes, that creates more opportunities for local employment and skills development across the Indo-Pacific, particularly the Pacific Islands.
We also remain committed to working with Pacific Island countries to maintain access to enduring banking services. Today, we jointly launch a new Pacific Banking Forum, in consultation with Pacific Island countries, to bring together our public and private sectors to address the causes of de-risking, and we affirm our plan to provide new and additional technical assistance to improve the region's access to financial services. We further intend to work with the Pacific to address the costs and accessibility of correspondent banking relationships, including by addressing jurisdiction-specific challenges and exploring regional approaches to aggregate payment flows, as appropriate.
Australia welcomes the United States Coast Guard's decision to forward deploy a cutter to the Pacific in early 2024 to provide an increased presence and support regional organizations to address maritime security priorities, including illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing. Australia plans to support the Coast Guard's increased regional presence through logistical support during its periodic deployments to the region.
Recognizing the importance of greater cultural, business, and educational exchanges with the Indo-Pacific, the United States welcomes Australia's establishment of a new Pacific Engagement Visa, to respond directly to requests from Pacific Island countries and Timor-Leste for access to Australia.
We reiterate our enduring commitment to deepen our respective engagement with Southeast Asia. As Comprehensive Strategic Partners of ASEAN, we reaffirm our commitment to ASEAN centrality and ASEAN-led regional architecture, and to supporting the implementation of the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific. We express our gratitude for Indonesia's leadership of ASEAN during its 2023 ASEAN Chair year, including the East Asia Summit, and commit to support Laos as ASEAN Chair in 2024.
We also commit to work together, and with like-minded partners, to support Southeast Asia's economic, development, and security priorities. We resolved to align implementation of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework and Invested: Australia's Southeast Asia Economic Strategy to 2040 to boost investment in energy transition and other strategic sectors and build supply chain resilience. The United States and Australia also plan to support cooperation with regional countries to promote a fair, open, inclusive, and sustainable digital economy. Recognizing the importance of regional food security, the U.S. and Australia plan to support ASEAN's efforts to build long-term resilient, inclusive, and sustainable agrifood systems, including through strengthening regional agricultural research and development. We look forward to furthering joint cooperation in Southeast Asia with regional partners, including Japan and the Republic of Korea.
Enhancing Defense and Security Cooperation 
Recognizing the historic and strategically significant defense announcements made at AUSMIN 2023, we welcome the progress on the delivery of our ambitious trajectory for Enhanced Force Posture Cooperation, including the rotation of U.S. Army Watercraft in Australia commencing in July, and scoping of upgrades at key Australian bases in the north. We also welcome the completion of a new fuel facility at RAAF Base Darwin in support of Enhanced Air Cooperation between the United States and Australia. We strongly endorse the work under way to establish guided weapons co-production, as a first step towards higher volumes of industrial production for the alliance. We applaud the implementation of the Australia-Japan Reciprocal Access Agreement, which has already deepened exercise collaboration and capabilities integration, paving the way for Australia's first ever participation in Exercises YAMA SAKURA and KEEN EDGE in Japan. Today, we announce our intention to explore trilateral cooperation with Japan on Unmanned Aerial Systems. Our cooperation aims to enhance interoperability and accelerate technology transfer in the rapidly emerging field of collaborative combat aircraft and autonomy.
We also affirm our commitment to bilateral cooperation on collaborative combat aircraft. Our cooperation will enhance interoperability and accelerate technology transfer in the rapidly emerging field of Unmanned Aerial Systems. In addition, Australia welcomes the U.S. decision to acquire the E-7A Wedgetail, and continued U.S. cooperation with Australia to ensure we can jointly develop and operate advanced military capabilities.
We note the substantial progress being made to support Australia's acquisition of conventionally-armed, nuclear-powered submarines through the trilateral AUKUS partnership while ensuring that these activities set the highest nuclear non-proliferation standard and are consistent with the partners' international and domestic obligations and commitments. Since we stood together in San Diego and announced the pathway for Australia to acquire conventionally-armed, nuclear-powered submarines (SSNs) in March, the first Australian military personnel have graduated from U.S. nuclear power school, and the U.S.S. North Carolina has completed the first SSN port visit to Australia in support of AUKUS. We also strongly support our deepened cooperation on advanced capabilities under AUKUS. We continue to make progress across our current capability development programs, including holding the first demonstration of AUKUS artificial intelligence and autonomous capabilities. As our work progresses on these and other defense and security capabilities, we will seek opportunities to engage allies and close partners. Our efforts through AUKUS are one of the many ways we are working together to deter aggression and support a free and open Indo-Pacific that is secure and stable.
We welcome the momentum and significant steps underway to streamline defense trade controls and information sharing between our nations, as part of our shared commitment to maximizing the strategic and technological advantage of the Alliance and to maximize the full potential of AUKUS. Australia acknowledges the U.S. Administration's significant steps in this regard, including the Biden Administration's bold proposal to Congress that would transform export controls laws. Australia is also examining its export controls framework to streamline the flow of defense information and technology and is taking steps to realize this ambition. Collectively these actions are designed to enhance and expedite collaboration between and among AUKUS partners to help us maintain our capability edge, while strengthening our ability to protect the sensitive technologies that underpin our security. Furthermore, we reiterate our joint commitment to strengthening security standards to safeguard sensitive technology and information.
We also affirm the importance of strengthening our cyber security in response to increasing global threats. The United States and Australia have a shared interest in promoting a safer and more secure cyberspace bilaterally and in multilateral forums, including with the Partners in the Blue Pacific, the Quad, and the International Counter Ransomware Initiative.
At AUSMIN 2011, both governments recognized that in the event of a cyberattack that threatens the territorial integrity, political independence, or security of either of our nations, under the ANZUS Treaty, the United States and Australia would consult together and determine appropriate options to address the threat. Today, we reaffirm that international law applies in cyberspace and that a cyberattack on our nations could constitute an armed attack under Article IV of the ANZUS Treaty. A decision as to when such a cyberattack would lead to the invocation of Article IV would be made on a case-by-case basis through close consultations between the United States and Australia.
We affirm that States should take appropriate measures to ensure the responsible development, deployment, and use of their military AI capabilities, including those enabling autonomous functions and systems.
Strengthening our Economic Security and Resilience 
We affirm our intention to continue increasing cooperation to build our shared economic security and resilience, including by promoting open, fair, and rules-based trade, countering non-market policies and practices, and deterring and addressing economic coercion. We intend to increase our cooperation to address these practices, including with other partners and allies.
As we strengthen and integrate our innovation ecosystems, we have a shared interest in enhancing our technology protection toolkits to ensure sensitive advanced technologies critical to military modernization cannot be used to undermine international peace and security. Australia acknowledges the strategic rationale of the U.S. Executive Order to advance a targeted set of controls on outbound investments in sensitive technologies with a core national security nexus. Australia regularly reviews its investment settings to ensure they remain fit for purpose to deal with emerging risks. We intend to maintain close consultations and communicate clearly to the private sector regarding our joint resolve and shared objectives in this area, including our long-standing commitment to investment and open and fair trade.
The United States and Australia have a deep and long-standing trade and investment relationship, underpinned by the Australia-U.S. Free Trade Agreement. We continue to work together to promote diversified supply chains and fair and open, rules-based trade. We share a commitment to the rules-based multilateral trading system, with the World Trade Organization (WTO) at its core. We continue to work together to reform the WTO so that it is better equipped to achieve its foundational objectives and address modern day challenges, and remain committed to conducting discussions with a view to having a fully- and well-functioning dispute settlement system accessible to all members by 2024. We look forward to a successful Thirteenth WTO Ministerial Conference and will continue to work constructively to ensure positive outcomes, including on reform issues.
We are committed to delivering strong outcomes on the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF). Together with other IPEF partners, the United States and Australia are tackling new and emerging economic challenges, including by strengthening trade connectivity and regional supply chains, unlocking green trade and investment to support the clean energy transition, accelerating anti-corruption, and enhancing tax cooperation efforts in the region.
Throughout the U.S. host year of APEC, we continue to advance a free, fair, and open economic policy agenda that empowers our workers and benefits all our people. We look forward to a successful APEC Economic Leaders' Week next month in San Francisco, which will make further progress towards a more resilient, inclusive, and sustainable future for us all.
Promoting Global and Regional Peace and Stability 
We are committed to upholding a global order underpinned by international rules and norms, with the United Nations (UN) at its heart. The United States and Australia are steadfast in their commitment to upholding international law, including the United Nations Charter and call for all countries to uphold its purposes, principles, and obligations arising under the Charter, including refraining from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State.
We condemn in the strongest possible terms Russia's illegal and unprovoked war against Ukraine. Russia's war violates international law, including the UN Charter, and is driving global food and energy insecurity. We once again call on Russia to immediately, completely, and unconditionally withdraw its forces from within the internationally recognized borders of Ukraine. The United States and Australia are committed to supporting Ukraine to empower it to resolve this conflict on its own terms.
In addition to support to Ukraine, Australia responded to a request from the United States to deploy a Royal Australian Air Force E-7A Wedgetail aircraft to Germany, which starts operations this week. The Australian deployment will bolster the multilayered protection of the international flow of assistance to Ukraine by providing early warning of a threat against the gateway of assistance. The United States also welcomes Australia's recent announcement that it will provide an additional $13 million in military assistance to Ukraine, including counter-drone and demining equipment.
Furthermore, we reaffirm our commitment to the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. We strongly condemn the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's (DPRK) unprecedented number of ballistic missile launches, including multiple intercontinental ballistic missile launches, that pose a grave threat to peace and security on the Korean Peninsula and beyond. We reiterate our commitment to the global nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament regime and its cornerstone, the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. We reaffirm our commitment to practical efforts to reduce nuclear risks and to the ultimate goal of a world without nuclear weapons.
We reaffirm our steadfast commitment to the Quad and its shared vision of an open, stable, and prosperous Indo-Pacific. We will continue to deliver on the Quad's positive and practical agenda, guided by the priorities of regional countries and responding to the regions' needs. We reiterate the Quad's unwavering support and respect for regional institutions, including ASEAN, PIF, and the Indian Ocean Rim Association. The United States applauds the success of Australia hosting the 2023 Quad Leaders' Summit in Hiroshima and we look forward to the next Quad Leaders' Summit being held in India.
We emphasize the importance of all States being able to exercise rights and freedoms in a manner consistent with international law as reflected in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), including freedom of navigation and overflight. We strongly oppose destabilizing actions in the South China Sea, such as unsafe encounters at sea and in the air, the militarization of disputed features, the dangerous use of coast guard vessels and maritime militia, including to interfere with routine Philippines maritime operations around Second Thomas Shoal, and efforts to disrupt other countries' offshore resource exploitation. We also recognize that the 2016 South China Sea Arbitral Award is final and legally binding on the parties in that proceeding, and we are concerned about China's excessive maritime claims that are inconsistent with international law, as well as unilateral actions that may raise tensions and increase the risk of miscalculation in the region. We resolve to work with partners to support regional maritime security and uphold international law.
We reaffirm the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and our shared opposition to unilateral changes to the status quo. We call for the peaceful resolution of cross-Strait issues through dialogue without the threat or use of force or coercion.
We emphasize the importance for all countries of promoting open channels of communication and practical measures to reduce the risk of misunderstanding and miscalculation and to prevent conflict in the Indo-Pacific.
Strengthening People-to-People Ties 
We acknowledge the richly diverse cultures of Indigenous Peoples in the United States and Australia, and both Governments reiterate our commitment to working in partnership with Native Hawaiians, Native American Tribes, and First Nations Peoples.
The United States and Australia have a shared interest in ensuring that our trade and investment agenda delivers inclusive economic growth and benefits for everyone. Today we have also committed to work together, and in genuine partnership with Indigenous businesses and stakeholders from both the United States and Australia, to grow opportunities for our Indigenous Peoples to enjoy the economic prosperity created by our two-way trade and investment. We welcome the opportunities that will be created by the U.S. announcement of new funding that will work with Australian government programs to support ongoing dialogue, knowledge-sharing, and increased business opportunities for our Indigenous Peoples over the coming months and years.
The United States is pleased to begin initial discussions with its international partners, including Australia, to explore a U.S. Transportation Security Administration ""One Stop Security"" pilot program. ""One Stop Security"" would streamline security screening requirements and shorten transit times for covered passenger populations. We appreciate Australia's interest in this pilot opportunity and look forward to continuing conversations based on security commensurability.
We reaffirm our commitment to gender equality, including through achieving Sustainable Development Goal 5, promoting women's leadership, and advancing women's economic empowerment globally, as well as countering efforts to push back against women's and girls' human rights. We emphasize the importance of working with partners to combat all forms of gender-based violence—online and offline—and fully implement the Women, Peace and Security agenda, especially in the Indo-Pacific. We commit to reinforce this coordination through our annual bilateral strategic dialogue on gender equality and as founding members of the Women in the Sustainable Economy Initiative. We also recommit to working together to promote children's online safety, including through strengthening bilateral coordination to advance awareness, prevention, and response to child sexual exploitation and abuse online.
This visit serves to reaffirm the commitment of the United States and Australia to build on our existing cooperation to enhance an Innovation Alliance that will benefit our two countries and the entire Indo-Pacific.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/joint-statement-president-biden-and-prime-minister-anthony-albanese-australia-building
Joe Biden,"October 25, 2023",Statement on the Election of J. Michael Johnson as Speaker of the House of Representatives,"Jill and I congratulate Speaker Johnson on his election. As I said when this process began, whoever the Speaker is, I will seek to work with them in good faith on behalf of the American people.
That's a principle I have always held to, and that I've acted on: delivering major bipartisan legislation on infrastructure, outcompeting China, gun reform, and veterans care.
I restated my willingness to continue working across the aisle after Republicans won the majority in the House last year. By the same token, the American people have made clear that they expect House Republicans to work with me and with Senate Democrats to govern across the aisle: to protect our urgent national security interests and grow our economy for the middle class.
While House Republicans spent the last 22 days determining who would lead their conference, I have worked on those pressing issues, proposing a historic supplemental funding package that advances our bipartisan national security interests in Israel and Ukraine, secures our border, and invests in the American people. These priorities have been endorsed by leaders in both parties.
We need to move swiftly to address our national security needs and to avoid a shutdown in 22 days.
Even though we have real disagreements about important issues, there should be mutual effort to find common ground wherever we can. This is a time for all of us to act responsibly, and to put the good of the American people and the everyday priorities of American families above any partisanship.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-the-election-j-michael-johnson-speaker-the-house-representatives

The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and Indonesia's Ministry of Environment and Forestry signed a new joint forest and wildlife conservation partnership agreement aimed at mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, safeguarding vulnerable species, adapting to the negative effects of climate change, and ensuring sustainable livelihoods for residents of forest communities. Furthermore, the United States and Indonesia plan to work together through the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment and regional initiatives such as IPEF to mobilize public and private investment in infrastructure to support Indonesia's sustainable growth and decent work for all.
President Widodo welcomes continued collaboration with the United States on the development of Indonesia's new capital city, Nusantara. The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) intends to fund a trade mission to the United States focused on the development of the new capital city to promote U.S. exports in quality, sustainable infrastructure and innovative smart-city solutions. USTDA also plans to fund training for Indonesian officials on value-based procurement for designing, evaluating, and awarding tenders for the new capital city. This work builds on USAID's ongoing technical assistance to the Nusantara New Capital Authority to develop smart building guidelines—the first of its kind in Indonesia. The U.S. Department of Commerce plans to organize a Smart City Business Development Mission to further strengthen trade and investment on smart city development in Indonesia.
The two leaders recognize important bilateral efforts to enhance cooperation in the health sector through increased research and technical collaboration, investment in human capital development, and the sharing of best practices.

Joe Biden,"November 14, 2023",Statement on the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index Report for October,"Today we saw more progress bringing down inflation while maintaining one of the strongest job markets in history. At 3.2 percent, annual inflation is now down by 65 percent from the peak. Gas prices are below $3.40 per gallon, reflecting an average decline of $1.65 from the peak after Putin's invasion of Ukraine. Inflation has come down while the unemployment rate has been below 4 percent for 21 months in a row—the longest stretch in more than 50 years—while wages, wealth, and the share of working-age Americans with jobs are all higher now than before the pandemic.
I'm working to get results for the American people and it's happening, and I'm not going to let up for 1 second. I'm fighting every single day to continue lowering costs for hard-working families so they have more breathing room, from eliminating costly junk fees on air fares and event tickets, to cutting prescription drug costs and health care premiums, to reducing energy costs.

Joe Biden,"November 17, 2023","Statement on the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Economic Leaders Meeting in San Francisco, California","With regard to the war against Ukraine, we reiterated our respective positions as expressed in other fora, including the U.N. Security Council and the U.N. General Assembly, which, in Resolution No. ES-11/1 dated 2 March 2022 as adopted by majority vote deplores in the strongest terms the aggression by the Russian Federation against Ukraine and demands its complete and unconditional withdrawal from the territory of Ukraine. Most members strongly condemn the aggression against Ukraine and underscore the need to reach a just and lasting peace based on the principles of the United Nations Charter, including the territorial integrity, sovereignty, and political independence of Ukraine. The war in Ukraine has further aggravated the ongoing food security crisis around the world, especially in developing and least developed countries. We note with deep concern the adverse impact of the war in Ukraine and stress that it is causing immense human suffering and exacerbating existing fragilities in the global economy: constraining growth, increasing inflation, disrupting supply chains, heightening energy and food insecurity, and elevating financial stability risks. In this context, the use or threat of use of nuclear weapon is inadmissible.
We exchanged views on the ongoing crisis in Gaza. Leaders, including the United States, shared their respective positions. Some leaders also shared the united messages of the Joint Arab-Islamic Summit in Riyadh on 11 November 2023.

Millions of Ukrainians—men, women, and children—suffered and starved to death between 1932-1933 because of a man-made famine. Stalin and his regime systematically seized Ukraine's grain and farms and transferred Ukrainian grain to other parts of the U.S.S.R. as a tactic to repress Ukraine's national identity.
Today, Ukraine's agricultural infrastructure is once more being deliberately targeted, this time by Vladimir Putin as part of his drive for conquest and power. Russian forces seek to destroy Ukraine's economy and independence, deliberately damaging fields and destroying Ukraine's grain storage facilities and ports. It is not just an attack on Ukraine's economic security, it is a cynical assault on food security everywhere. Putin is hurting the world's most vulnerable communities, for Russia's profit.
On this anniversary, we remember and honor all those, both past and present, who have endured such hardship and who continue still to fight against tyranny. We also recommit ourselves to preventing suffering, protecting fundamental freedoms, and responding to human rights abuses whenever and wherever they occur. We stand united with Ukraine.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-honoring-the-victims-the-ukrainian-holodomor-0
Joe Biden,"December 06, 2023",Joint Statement—Group of Seven (G-7) Nations Leaders Statement,"We, the Leaders of the Group of Seven (G7), met virtually on December 6, 2023, to address global challenges and shape a course for a better future. We reaffirm our commitment made at the G7 Summit in Hiroshima, which is a city that suffered an atomic bombing and now has become a symbol of peace. We were joined by Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. We remain committed to upholding the rule of law, which protects all nations, especially the vulnerable, as well as global security and human dignity in all parts of the world. We are more united than ever in the pursuit of international peace, prosperity and sustainable development, and have strengthened our engagement with international partners beyond the G7. We thank the Japanese Presidency for their leadership across this year.
Ukraine 
For 650 days, the Ukrainian people have bravely resisted Russia's illegal aggression. We salute their courage and their resilience, and express our full sympathy and condolences for those suffering. We pay tribute to the sacrifices made by Ukraine to preserve its freedom and the values we share. Our steadfast commitment to supporting Ukraine's fight for its independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity will never waver. We are taking additional steps today to support Ukrainians in their pursuit of a comprehensive, just and lasting peace that will uphold all the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations (UN), including respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty.
We are determined to support an independent, democratic Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders. We continue to support Ukraine in further developing President Zelenskyy's Peace Formula. As stated in the Joint Declaration of Support for Ukraine on July 12, 2023, we are formalizing our enduring support to Ukraine through specific, bilateral, long-term security commitments and arrangements.
Our commitment remains to restrict exports of all items critical to Russia's military and industrial base, including those used on the battlefield and we call on third parties to take equivalent action. We repeat our call for third parties to immediately cease providing material support to Russia's aggression, or face severe cost. We will work to further curtail Russia's use of the international financial system to further its war in Ukraine, including Russia's efforts to use the international financial system to facilitate its expansion of its military industrial base. We will update our measures. We will step up our efforts against evasion and circumvention of our sanctions and export controls measures. We continue to take actions against third country actors who materially support Russia's war including by imposing additional measures on entities where appropriate in third countries. We are targeting Russian military procurement networks and those who help Russia acquire machine tools, equipment and key inputs.
We are limiting Russia's ability to fund its illegal war by taking steps to limit Russia's energy revenue and its future extractive capabilities. We have dramatically reduced our reliance on Russian energy and commodities. We are determined to accelerate work on this path so that Russia is no longer able to weaponize energy against us. We commit to tightening compliance and enforcement of the price cap policy on Russian oil, including by imposing sanctions on those engaged in deceptive practices and by updating our compliance rules and regulations as necessary. We will also continue efforts to curtail Russia's revenue from other relevant sectors. We will also continue efforts to reduce Russia's revenue from metals. We will introduce import restrictions on non-industrial diamonds, mined, processed, or produced in Russia, by January 1, 2024, followed by further phased restrictions on the import of Russian diamonds processed in third countries targeting March 1, 2024. To further the effectiveness of these measures, those G7 members who are major importers of rough diamonds will establish a robust traceability-based verification and certification mechanism for rough diamonds within the G7 by September 1, 2024, and we will continue to consult with partners, including producing and manufacturing countries on its design and implementation.
We will continue consultations among G7 members and with other partners including producing countries as well as manufacturing countries for comprehensive controls for diamonds produced and processed in third countries on measures for traceability.
As Russia seeks to use winter as a weapon against the Ukrainian people, we are increasing our efforts to provide humanitarian aid and critical energy assistance. We strongly condemn Russian attacks against critical and civil infrastructure across Ukraine. We are supporting Ukraine's recovery and reconstruction, including through the Multi-agency Donor Coordination Platform for Ukraine, and working to encourage further involvement of our private sector. We look forward to successful completion of the upcoming review of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) program for Ukraine and support Ukraine's continued reform agenda including the efforts for its European path. Decisive progress is needed to direct extraordinary revenues held by private entities stemming directly from Russia's immobilized sovereign assets to support Ukraine, consistent with applicable contractual obligations and in accordance with applicable laws. We reaffirm that consistent with our respective legal systems, Russia's sovereign assets in our jurisdictions will remain immobilized until Russia pays for the damage it caused to Ukraine.
It is not right for Russia to decide if or when it will pay for the damage it has caused in Ukraine. Russia's obligations under international law are clear: Russia must both end its illegal war of aggression and pay for the damage it has caused, which according to the World Bank to date, already exceeds $400 billion dollars. In light of the urgency of disrupting Russia's attempts to destroy the Ukrainian economy and failure to abide by its international law obligations, we will explore all possible avenues to aid Ukraine in obtaining compensation from Russia, consistent with our respective legal systems and international law. We direct our relevant ministers to continue working on this issue towards our next meeting.
We reiterate our commitment to holding those responsible to account consistent with international law, including by supporting the efforts of international mechanisms, such as the International Criminal Court (ICC) and the International Centre for the Prosecution of the Crime of Aggression against Ukraine (ICPA) at Eurojust and welcome ongoing discussions in the Core Group exploring the establishment of a tribunal for the prosecution of the crime of aggression against Ukraine.
Russia's irresponsible nuclear rhetoric, its posture of strategic intimidation and its undermining of arms control regimes are unacceptable. Threats by Russia of nuclear weapon use, let alone any use of nuclear weapons by Russia, in the context of its war of aggression against Ukraine are inadmissible. We deeply regret Russia's decision to withdraw its ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. We strongly support the International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) continued presence and call for unfettered access to all of Ukraine's nuclear sites.
We deplore Russia's systematic targeting of Ukrainian Black Sea ports, grain and grain infrastructure. We support all efforts, including those of the UN, to facilitate exports of Ukraine's grain and other agricultural products. We welcome the success of Ukraine's maritime corridor and the EU's Solidarity Lanes. The increasing levels of global food and nutrition insecurity are exacerbated by Russia's aggression against Ukraine.
Middle East 
We unequivocally condemn the horrific terror attacks across Israel by Hamas and others that began on October 7, 2023. We emphasize Israel's right to defend itself and its people against Hamas, in accordance with international law, as it seeks to prevent a recurrence of these traumatic events, which included murder, hostage-taking, sexual violence, and attacks on children. Hamas offers nothing but suffering to the Palestinian people, and it is an obstacle to a better future for them and for the region. We will continue to coordinate our efforts to isolate Hamas and ensure it cannot threaten Israel.
While welcoming the recent pause that allowed the release of hostages and vital humanitarian aid into Gaza, achieved by the leadership of the United States, Qatar, Egypt, and other countries in the region, we deeply regret that Hamas refused to release all of the female hostages and military operations have resumed. Hamas has shown that it still poses a security threat to Israel, as demonstrated by its continued rocket fire since October 7 and its public statements asserting that it will continue to attack Israel in the future. We urge the immediate release of all remaining hostages without preconditions. At the same time, more urgent action is needed to address the deteriorating humanitarian crisis in Gaza and minimize civilian casualties. We support and encourage further humanitarian pauses to enable this.
We are also deeply concerned with the devastating impact on the Palestinian civilian population in Gaza. More effective action must also be taken to prevent the displacement of additional people and protect civilian infrastructure. Every effort must be made to ensure unhindered and continued humanitarian assistance for civilians, including food, water, medical care, fuel, and shelter, and access for humanitarian workers. The population is increasingly vulnerable, and with winter approaching, we must continue to increase the flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza to meet fully the needs on the ground, including by opening additional crossings. We underscore the importance of conducting deconfliction, protecting civilians and compliance with international law, in particular international humanitarian law. Since October 7, 2023, we have announced more than $600 million for assistance to the Palestinian people, including through United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) and other UN agencies as well as other humanitarian actors. We call on the international community to fully fund the UN's flash appeal and are contributing to that effort.
We condemn the rise in extremist settler violence committed against Palestinians, which undermines security and stability in the West Bank, and threatens prospects for a lasting peace. Those who have committed crimes must be held to account. Regional actors must cease de-stabilizing activities: in particular, we call on Iran to refrain from providing support for Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, and other non-state actors, and to use its influence with those groups to de-escalate regional tensions. We, along with partners in the region, are working intensively to prevent the conflict from escalating further and spreading more widely. Emphasizing the global importance of maritime security, we call on all parties not to threaten or interfere with lawful exercise of navigation rights and freedoms by all vessels, and condemn the four attacks on December 3 against three separate commercial vessels, connected to fourteen separate nations, operating in international waters in the southern Red Sea. We especially call on the Houthis to immediately cease attacks on civilians and threats to international shipping lanes and commercial vessels. There are reasons to believe that attacks by the Houthis are enabled by Iran. We express our deep concern with the rise of hateful speech and acts across the world since the beginning of the conflict, and categorically reject antisemitism and Islamophobia in any form.
Israelis and Palestinians have an equal right to live in safety, dignity, and peace. We are committed to working closely with partners to assist in building the conditions for sustainable long-term solutions for Gaza. We also need to see a return to a broader peace process. We remain committed to a Palestinian state as part of a two-state solution that enables both Israelis and Palestinians to live in a just, lasting, and secure peace.
Indo-Pacific and the Region 
We remain determined that Iran must never develop a nuclear weapon and reiterate that Iran must cease its unabated escalation of its nuclear program, which has no credible civilian justification and brings it dangerously close to actual weapon-related activities. We call on Iran to fulfill its legal obligations and political commitments regarding nuclear non-proliferation with prompt action, including the full and unconditional cooperation with the IAEA.
Together with regional partners, including the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and its Member States, South Asian countries as well as the Pacific Island countries, we will continue our endeavors towards a free and open Indo-Pacific, which is inclusive, prosperous, secure, and based on the rule of law, and that protects shared principles.
Reconfirming the G7 Hiroshima Leaders' Communique, we stand together as G7 partners on the following elements, which underpin our respective relations with China:
We stand prepared to build constructive and stable relations with China, recognizing the importance of engaging candidly with and expressing our concerns directly to China. We act in our national interest. It is necessary to cooperate with China, given its role in the international community and the size of its economy, on global challenges as well as areas of common interest.
We call on China to engage with us, including in international fora, on areas such as the climate and biodiversity crisis and the conservation of natural resources in the framework of the Paris and Kunming-Montreal Agreements, addressing vulnerable countries' debt sustainability and financing needs, global health and macroeconomic stability.
Our policy approaches are not designed to harm China nor do we seek to thwart China's economic progress and development. A growing China that plays by international rules would be of global interest. We are not decoupling or turning inwards. At the same time, we recognize that economic resilience requires de-risking and diversifying. We will take steps, individually and collectively, to invest in our own economic vibrancy. We will reduce excessive dependencies in our critical supply chains.
With a view to enabling sustainable economic relations with China, and strengthening the international trading system, we will push for a level playing field for our workers and companies. We will seek to address the challenges posed by China's non-market policies and practices, which distort the global economy. We will counter malign practices, such as illegitimate technology transfer or data disclosure. We will foster resilience to economic coercion. We also recognize the necessity of protecting certain advanced technologies that could be used to threaten our national security without unduly limiting trade and investment.
We remain seriously concerned about the situation in the East and South China Seas. We strongly oppose any unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force or coercion.
We reaffirm the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait as indispensable to security and prosperity in the international community. There is no change in the basic positions of the G7 members on Taiwan, including stated one China policies. We call for a peaceful resolution of cross-Strait issues.
We will keep voicing our concerns about the human rights situation in China, including in Tibet and Xinjiang where forced labor is of major concern to us. We call on China to honor its commitments under the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law, which enshrine rights, freedoms and a high degree of autonomy for Hong Kong.
We call on China to act in accordance with its obligations under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the Vienna Convention on Consular relations, and not to conduct interference activities aimed at undermining the security and safety of our communities, the integrity of our democratic institutions and our economic prosperity.
We call on China to press Russia to stop its military aggression, and immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw its troops from Ukraine. We encourage China to support a comprehensive, just and lasting peace based on territorial integrity and the principles and purposes of the UN Charter, including through its direct dialogue with Ukraine.
There is no legal basis for China's expansive maritime claims in the South China Sea, and we oppose China's militarization activities in the region. We emphasize the universal and unified character of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and reaffirm UNCLOS's important role in setting out the legal framework that governs all activities in the oceans and the seas. We reiterate that the award rendered by the Arbitral Tribunal on July 12, 2016, is a significant milestone, which is legally binding upon the parties to those proceedings, and a useful basis for peacefully resolving disputes between the parties.
We reiterate our call for the complete, verifiable, and irreversible dismantlement of all North Korea's weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles. We urge all UN Member States to fully implement all relevant UN Security Council resolutions (UNSCRs). We strongly condemn continued ballistic missile launches, the recent launch using ballistic missile technology conducted on November 21, 2023 and arms transfers from North Korea to Russia, which directly violate relevant UNSCRs. We urge North Korea to respect human rights, facilitate access for international humanitarian organizations, and resolve the abductions issue immediately.
We welcome Japan's safe, transparent, and science-based process, including the continued monitoring of the situation, to responsibly manage the discharge of Advanced Liquid Processing System treated water from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station into the sea in proactively coordinating with scientists and partners, particularly across the Indo-Pacific region, as well as with the IAEA. We also welcome the IAEA's comprehensive report of July 4, 2023 as well as its continued monitoring. We acknowledge the importance of the IAEA's onsite presence during the process.
We support Indonesia initiating the accession process to become a full member of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) as well as further progress on ongoing accession processes more broadly.
Supporting Developing Economies and Strengthening International Financial Institutions 
We reiterate our steadfast commitment to the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We remain committed to partnering with developing countries, particularly low-income countries, in dealing with multiple and complex challenges, and in mobilizing finance for development from all sources. We reaffirm our commitment to mobilizing up to $600 billion by 2027 through the G7 Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) by scaling up public and private financing and investments through tailored country approaches and by developing key economic corridors.
We are working to deliver better, bigger, and more effective multilateral development banks (MDBs) by enhancing operating models, improving responsiveness and accessibility, and substantially increasing financing capacity to maximize development impact as well as by making MDBs work better as a system. We urge MDBs to continue their steadfast efforts to further implement the G20 Capital Adequacy Framework (CAF) recommendations. We urge the WBG to continue to implement operational and financial reforms. We will deliver on the G20 Leaders' commitment to collectively mobilizing more lending headroom and concessional finance to boost the World Bank's capacity to support low and middle-income countries that need help in addressing global challenges, with a clear framework for the allocation of scarce concessional resources, and to provide strong support for the poorest countries. The G7 has already announced planned contributions that will unlock more than $35 billion and will step up efforts to deliver substantial contributions to this end. We are committed to collectively securing an ambitious International Development Association (IDA) 21 replenishment next year. We will work together over the next year to encourage and support the MDBs in strengthening their efforts to mobilize private capital and domestic resources.
At the IMF, we support the work to ensure the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT) is on a sustainable footing to meet the growing needs of low-income countries. We welcome the approval by the IMF Executive Board on a proposal to the Board of Governors to conclude the 16th General Review of Quotas of the IMF with a quota increase by December 15, 2023. We welcome the achievement of the $100 billion Special Drawing Rights (SDR) channeling target and will further explore viable options for enabling the voluntary channeling of SDRs through MDBs while respecting national legal frameworks and the need to preserve the reserve asset character and status of SDRs.
We will work together and with partners to deliver further progress on this global agenda, including through the IMF, MDB boards and the G20, as well as the discussions following the Paris Pact for People and the Planet and the G20 Compact with Africa Conference in Berlin.
We will continue to provide developing countries support for strengthening their tax capacity to build sustainable tax revenue sources to help deliver the SDGs. We also emphasize the role this support can play in implementation of the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Two-Pillar Solution.
We reiterate the urgency of addressing debt vulnerabilities in low- and middle-income countries. This includes finalizing outstanding country cases, making future debt treatment more transparent and timely, and improving our toolkits to put countries tackling reforms on more sustainable footing before they fall into crisis. We welcome the finalization of Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on the debt treatment for Zambia and call for swift agreement on debt treatment for Ghana and Ethiopia. Following the recent agreement between Sri Lanka and its official creditors, we look forward to the swift resolution of the debt treatment of Sri Lanka. We welcome joint efforts by all stakeholders, including private creditors, to continue working towards enhancing debt transparency. We recognize the role that climate resilient debt clauses (CRDC) can play in enhancing the safety net for borrowers facing the impact of climate change.
Climate Change, Energy and Environment 
We remain steadfast in our commitment to the Paris Agreement, keeping a limit of 1.5°C global temperature rise within reach through scaled up action in this critical decade. We welcome the first global stocktake (GST), and will pursue ambitious outcomes at the ongoing 28th Session of the Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC-COP 28) in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and extend our full support to the UAE Presidency. We welcome the swift adoption of the decision on operationalization of the new funding arrangements.
While acknowledging various pathways according to each country's energy situation, industrial and social structures and geographical conditions, we reiterate that these should lead to our common goal of net zero by 2050 at the latest in order to keep a limit of 1.5°C within reach. We will contribute towards and support a global tripling of renewable energy capacity and a doubling of annual energy efficiency improvements by 2030 taking into consideration national circumstances, with currently 123 countries supporting those targets at COP 28. We will do this hand in hand with accelerating the phase out of unabated fossil fuels so as to achieve our climate ambition. We commit to prioritizing concrete and timely steps towards the goal of accelerating the phase out of domestic unabated coal power generation, and to ending the construction of new unabated coal fired power generation. Those G7 countries that opt to use nuclear energy recognize its potential to provide affordable low carbon energy that can reduce dependence on fossil fuels, to address climate crisis, and to ensure global energy security as the source of baseload energy and grid flexibility, and support a global aspirational goal of tripling nuclear energy capacity from 2020 by 2050 that was endorsed by a coalition of 23 countries in the margins of the COP28, recognizing the different domestic circumstances of each country.
We continue our implementation of our commitments to the developed country Parties' goal of jointly mobilizing $100 billion annually in climate finance by 2020 through to 2025, and welcome that the goal looks likely to have been met as of 2022 as stated in the Report by the OECD Secretary-General. We underscore the need to enhance international cooperation and coordination within the G7 and beyond. In this regard, recalling our determination to support developing countries' just energy transitions, we welcome progress achieved on Just Energy Transition Partnerships (JETPs) with partner countries and will continue our efforts for its implementation.
We reiterate our commitment to the swift and full implementation of the Kunming Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework and to achievement of each of its goals and targets. We are committed to ending plastic pollution, with the ambition to reduce additional plastic pollution to zero by 2040 including through an international legally binding instrument.
Economic Resilience and Economic Security 
Recalling the G7 Statement on Economic Resilience and Economic Security and recognizing that the weaponization of economic vulnerabilities is becoming a growing concern for G7 members and other countries, we are determined to continue making progress to enhance our strategic coordination on these issues, including through the G7's Coordination Platform on Economic Coercion. We will increase our collective assessment, preparedness, deterrence, and response to economic coercion, and further promote cooperation with partners beyond the G7. We will also coordinate, as appropriate, to support targeted states, economies and entities as a demonstration of solidarity and resolve to uphold the rule of law.
We have strengthened channels of communication to address supply disruptions and shared insights and best practices, including from respective scenario-based stress testing. We will further step up our collaboration based on the principles on resilient and reliable supply chains, including for critical minerals, semiconductors and batteries, which are now supported by a broader number of partners beyond the G7. We encourage all countries to support them. We welcome the successful launch of the ""Partnership for RISE (Resilient and Inclusive Supply-chain Enhancement)"" and continue to support its implementation with speed and quality.
We affirm our shared responsibility and determination to coordinate on preventing the cutting-edge technologies we develop from being used to further military capabilities that threaten international peace and security. To this end, we will share, as appropriate, information and experiences to further develop common understanding of such risks and the policy tools needed to address them, and take further actions where necessary, including those related to export and investment, corresponding to the circumstances of each country. We will further strengthen multilateral efforts to cooperate in the field of export controls to ensure gaps in our dual use technology protection ecosystem cannot be exploited. We have a common interest in preventing the narrow set of technological advances that are assessed to be core to enhancing the military and intelligence capabilities of actors who may use these capabilities to undermine international peace and security, from being fueled by our companies' capital, expertise, and knowledge. We recognize that appropriate measures designed to address risks from outbound investment could be important to complement existing tools of targeted controls on exports and inbound investments, which work together to protect our sensitive technologies from being used in ways that threaten international peace and security.
We will increase our efforts to implement risk-based policies and measures to promote research security and research integrity.
We reiterate our commitment to working and coordinating on economic resilience and economic security through the G7 framework to make year-on-year progress in a holistic manner.
Trade 
We underscore the need to pursue WTO reform to improve all its functions through an inclusive member driven process, and remain committed to conducting discussions with a view to having a fully and well-functioning dispute settlement system accessible to all members by 2024. We will continue to work towards concrete and ambitious outcomes at the upcoming 13th WTO Ministerial Conference.
Food Security 
We welcome progress on coordinated actions of the G7 with a wide range of stakeholders to strengthen global food security and nutrition. We recognize the continuing urgency and renew our commitment to working together with partners beyond the G7 to build resilient and sustainable agriculture and food systems and to progressively realize the right to adequate food and nutrition for all, in particular by ensuring open and fair agricultural trade, promoting resilient food supply chains and improving agricultural productivity in a sustainable manner. We also stress the need to improve availability, affordability and accessibility and promote efficient and responsible use of fertilizers, including through local fertilizer production.
We renew our commitment to developing and strengthening the global health architecture (GHA) for future health emergencies, achieving more resilient, equitable, and sustainable universal health coverage (UHC), and promoting health innovations.
We reaffirm our commitment to enhancing governance, international norms and regulations including through the negotiations on the future international agreement on pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response (PPR) (WHO CA+). We also commit to financing for PPR, including through the Pandemic Fund, enhanced manufacturing capacity globally, and the exploration of a rapid response financing framework.
We also continue to call for further domestic resource mobilization, as well as efficient use of existing resources, and private financing, including through ""Impact Investment Initiative (the Triple I) for Global Health.""
Building on the G7 Hiroshima Vision for Equitable Access to medical countermeasures (MCMs), we welcome the collaborative progress made on the MCM Delivery Partnership for equitable access (MCDP) and also commit to explore further means to coordinate and mobilize surge financing for production, procurement, and delivery of MCMs, including development financing solutions.
We will further promote comprehensive sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR).
Digital 
We renew our commitment to advancing international discussions on inclusive artificial intelligence (AI) governance and interoperability between AI governance frameworks, while we recognize that approaches and policy instruments to achieve the common vision and goal of trustworthy AI may vary across G7 members, to achieve our common vision and goal of safe, secure, and trustworthy AI, in line with our shared democratic values. We endorse the outcomes of the G7 Digital and Tech Ministers' Meeting on December 1, 2023, notably the Hiroshima AI Process Comprehensive Policy Framework and the Work Plan to advance Hiroshima AI Process. We welcome the Hiroshima AI Process Comprehensive Policy Framework. It represents the first successful international framework that includes guiding principles and the code of conduct to address the impact of advanced AI systems on our societies and economies. We call on AI actors to support the Hiroshima Process International Guiding Principles and the Hiroshima Process International Code of Conduct. The achievement of the Hiroshima AI Process under Japan's G7 Presidency shows that we can act quickly to lead the way in responsible innovation and in the governance of emerging technologies. We look forward to further advancing the Hiroshima AI Process in accordance with the work plan developed by relevant Ministers.
We welcome the UK hosted AI Safety Summit and look forward to the next international AI meetings to be hosted by the Republic of Korea and France. We reaffirm the importance of our close cooperation with the OECD and the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI).
We commit to working together for further advancing the Data Free Flow with Trust (DFFT), and welcome the concrete progress made in establishing the Institutional Arrangement for Partnership in cooperation with the OECD.
Conclusion 
As we look to the 2024 Italian G7 Presidency, and in our support to the Brazilian G20 Presidency, we will strive towards a peaceful and prosperous world, building on the outcomes achieved in Hiroshima.
Under the Italian Presidency, we will continue our support to Ukraine and will address other crises. We will promote mutually beneficial partnerships with developing and emerging countries, particularly in Africa. We will address key issues, such as economic security and resilience, sustainable development, food and energy security, gender equality, AI, irregular migration, and human trafficking.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/joint-statement-group-seven-g-7-nations-leaders-statement-1
Joe Biden,"December 13, 2023",Statement on House of Representatives Approval of a Resolution Authorizing an Impeachment Inquiry Into the President,"The American people need their leaders in Congress to take action on important priorities for the Nation and world.
On Tuesday, I met with the President of Ukraine, who is leading his people in a battle for freedom against Russian aggression. He came to America to ask us for help. Yet Republicans in Congress won't act to help.
The people of Israel are in a battle against terrorists, and they are waiting for our help. Yet Republicans in Congress won't act to help.
We have to address the situation at our southern border, and I am determined to try to fix the problem. We need funding to strengthen border security, but Republicans in Congress won't act to help.
We need to continue our progress on the economy and make sure inflation keeps going down and job growth keeps going up. That means avoiding self-inflicted economic crises like a Government shutdown, which Republicans in Congress are driving us toward in just a few weeks because they won't act now to fund the Government and critical priorities to make life better for the American people.
There is a lot of work to be done. But after wasting weeks trying to find a new Speaker of the House and having to expel their own Members, Republicans in Congress are leaving for a month without doing anything to address these pressing challenges.
I wake up every day focused on the issues facing the American people, real issues that impact their lives and the strength and security of our country and the world. Unfortunately, House Republicans are not joining me. Instead of doing anything to help make Americans' lives better, they are focused on attacking me with lies. Instead of doing their job on the urgent work that needs to be done, they are choosing to waste time on this baseless political stunt that even Republicans in Congress admit is not supported by facts.
The American people deserve better. I know what I am going to remain focused on. I would invite Republicans in Congress to join me.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-house-representatives-approval-resolution-authorizing-impeachment-inquiry-into
Joe Biden,"December 29, 2023",Statement on Russia's Aerial Assault on Ukraine,"Overnight, Russia launched its largest aerial assault on Ukraine since this war began. This massive bombardment used drones and missiles, including missiles with hypersonic capability, to strike cities and civilian infrastructure all across Ukraine. Strikes reportedly hit a maternity hospital, a shopping mall, and residential areas, killing innocent people and injuring dozens more. It is a stark reminder to the world that, after nearly 2 years of this devastating war, Putin's objective remains unchanged. He seeks to obliterate Ukraine and subjugate its people. He must be stopped.
In the face of this brutal attack, Ukraine deployed the air defense systems that the United States and our allies and partners have delivered to Ukraine over the past year to successfully intercept and destroy many of the missiles and drones. The American people can be proud of the lives we have helped to save and the support we have given Ukraine as it defends its people, its freedom, and its independence. But unless Congress takes urgent action in the new year, we will not be able to continue sending the weapons and vital air defense systems Ukraine needs to protect its people. Congress must step up and act without any further delay.
The stakes of this fight extend far beyond Ukraine. They affect the entirety of the NATO alliance, the security of Europe, and the future of the transatlantic relationship. Putin has not just attempted to destroy Ukraine, he has threatened some of our NATO allies as well. When dictators and autocrats are allowed to run roughshod in Europe, the risk rises that the United States gets pulled in directly. And the consequences reverberate around the world. That's why the United States has rallied a coalition of more than 50 countries to support the defense of Ukraine. We cannot let our allies and partners down. We cannot let Ukraine down. History will judge harshly those who fail to answer freedom's call.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-russias-aerial-assault-ukraine
Joe Biden,"February 04, 2024",Statement on the Bipartisan Senate Agreement for National Security Legislation,"For too long, going back decades, the immigration system has been broken. It's time to fix it. That's why over 2 months ago I instructed members of my administration to work with a bipartisan group of Senators to—finally—seriously address the issue. And that's what they've done, working around the clock, through the holidays and over weekends. Now we've reached an agreement on a bipartisan national security deal that includes the toughest and fairest set of border reforms in decades. I strongly support it.
It will make our country safer, make our border more secure, treat people fairly and humanely while preserving legal immigration, consistent with our values as a nation. It would give me, as President, a new emergency authority to shut down the border when it becomes overwhelmed. It will make our asylum process fairer and more efficient while protecting the most vulnerable. It will expedite work permits so that those who are here and qualify can get to work more quickly. It will create more opportunities for families to come together, through short-term visits as well as increased permanent lawful pathways. It ensures the most vulnerable, unaccompanied young children, have paid legal representation. And it will provide the resources I have repeatedly requested to secure the border by adding border patrol agents, immigration judges, asylum officers, and cutting-edge inspection machines to help detect and stop the flow of fentanyl. While this agreement doesn't address everything I would have wanted, these reforms are essential for making our border more orderly, secure, fair, and humane.
The bipartisan national security agreement would also address two other important priorities. It allows the United States to continue our vital work, together with partners all around the world, to stand up for Ukraine's freedom and support its ability to defend itself against Russia's aggression. As I have said before, if we don't stop Putin's appetite for power and control in Ukraine, he won't limit himself to just Ukraine and the costs for America will rise. This agreement also provides Israel what they need to protect their people and defend itself against Hamas terrorists. And it will provide lifesaving humanitarian assistance for the Palestinian people.
There is more work to be done to get it over the finish line. But I want to be clear about something: If you believe, as I do, that we must secure the border now, doing nothing is not an option. Working with my administration, the United States Senate has done the hard work it takes to reach a bipartisan agreement. Now House Republicans have to decide. Do they want to solve the problem? Or do they want to keep playing politics with the border?
I've made my decision. I'm ready to solve the problem. I'm ready to secure the border. And so are the American people. I know we have our divisions at home, but we cannot let partisan politics get in the way of our responsibilities as a great nation. I refuse to let that happen. In moments like these, we have to remember who we are. We're the United States of America, and there is nothing, nothing beyond our capacity if we do it together.
I urge Congress to come together and swiftly pass this bipartisan agreement. Get it to my desk so I can sign it into law immediately.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-the-bipartisan-senate-agreement-for-national-security-legislation
Joe Biden,"February 13, 2024",Statement on Senate Passage of Emergency National Security Supplemental Appropriations Legislation,"This bipartisan supplemental agreement is critical to advancing America's national security interests. It will allow the United States to continue our vital work, together with our allies and partners all around the world, to stand up for Ukraine's freedom and support its ability to defend itself against Russia's aggression. It will provide Israel with what it needs to protect its people against Hamas terrorists. Significantly, this agreement will provide lifesaving humanitarian assistance for the Palestinian people, the vast majority of whom have nothing to do with Hamas.
I applaud the bipartisan coalition of Senators who came together to advance this agreement, and I urge the House to move on this with urgency. We cannot afford to wait any longer. The costs of inaction are rising every day, especially in Ukraine. Already, we are seeing reports of Ukrainian troops running out of ammunition on the front lines as Russian forces continue to attack and Putin continues to dream of subjugating the Ukrainian people. There are those who say American leadership and our alliances and partnerships with countries around the world do not matter. They do. If we do not stand against tyrants who seek to conquer or carve up their neighbors' territory, the consequences for America's national security will be significant. Our allies and adversaries alike will take note. It is time for the House to take action and send this bipartisan legislation to my desk immediately so that I can sign it into law.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-senate-passage-emergency-national-security-supplemental-appropriations
Joe Biden,"February 23, 2024",Statement Ahead of the Second Anniversary of Russia's Assault Against Ukraine,"Two years ago tomorrow, shortly before dawn, Russian missiles began exploding near the capital city of Kyiv. Russian troops marched across the border into Ukraine. Vladimir Putin's vicious onslaught against Ukraine had begun.
He believed that he could easily bend the will and break the resolve of a free people; that he could roll into a sovereign nation, and the world would roll over; that he could shake the foundations of security in Europe and beyond.
Two years later, we see even more vividly what we've known since day one: Putin miscalculated badly. The brave people of Ukraine fight on, unbowed in their determination to defend their freedom and future. NATO is stronger, larger, and more united than ever. And the unprecedented 50-nation global coalition in support of Ukraine, led by the United States, remains committed to providing critical assistance to Ukraine and holding Russia accountable for its aggression.
The American people and people around the world understand that the stakes of this fight extend far beyond Ukraine. Ten years ago, Putin occupied Crimea, and created puppet regimes in Ukraine's Luhansk and Donetsk regions. Two years ago, he tried to wipe Ukraine off the map. If Putin does not pay the price for his death and destruction, he will keep going. And the costs to the United States—along with our NATO allies and partners in Europe and around the world—will rise.
Today I am announcing more than 500 new sanctions against Russia for its ongoing war of conquest on Ukraine and for the death of Aleksey Navalny, who was a courageous anticorruption activist and Putin's fiercest opposition leader. These sanctions will target individuals connected to Navalny's imprisonment as well as Russia's financial sector, defense industrial base, procurement networks and sanctions evaders across multiple continents. They will ensure Putin pays an even steeper price for his aggression abroad and repression at home.
We are also imposing new export restrictions on nearly 100 entities for providing backdoor support for Russia's war machine. We are taking action to further reduce Russia's energy revenues. And I've directed my team to strengthen support for civil society, independent media, and those who fight for democracy around the world.
Two years into this war, the people of Ukraine continue to fight with tremendous courage. But they are running out of ammunition. Ukraine needs more supplies from the United States to hold the line against Russia's relentless attacks, which are enabled by arms and ammunition from Iran and North Korea. That's why the House of Representatives must pass the bipartisan national security supplemental bill, before it's too late.
This bill provides urgent funding for Ukraine. It also invests in America's own defense industrial base. It passed overwhelmingly in the Senate, and there is no question that, if the Speaker called a vote, it would pass quickly in the House. Congress knows that by supporting this bill, we can strengthen security in Europe, strengthen our security at home, and stand up to Putin. Opposing this bill only plays into his hands.
History is watching. The failure to support Ukraine at this critical moment will not be forgotten. Now is the time for us to stand strong with Ukraine and stand united with our allies and partners. Now is the time to prove that the United States stands up for freedom and bows down to no one.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-ahead-the-second-anniversary-russias-assault-against-ukraine
Joe Biden,"February 24, 2024",Joint Statement by Group of Seven (G-7) Nations Leaders,"We the Leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) met today with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to reaffirm our unwavering support for Ukraine and salute once more the bravery and resilience of the Ukrainian people who have been fighting tirelessly for Ukraine's freedom and democratic future.
They have resisted for two years Russia's illegal, unjustifiable, and unprovoked full-scale invasion which constitutes a blatant violation of the UN Charter. They have proven their will to defeat President Putin's war machine, restore their nation's territorial integrity, and defend Ukraine's sovereignty and independence.
President Putin has failed to achieve his strategic objective of subjugating Ukraine. Instead, he is forcing his own people to pay a heavy price for his government's reckless actions each day. He has drained Russia's resources to fund an unnecessary war, torn Russian families apart, and claimed hundreds of thousands of Russian lives.
We remain convinced that we can ensure the people of Ukraine prevail in fighting for their future and help to forge a comprehensive, just and durable peace.
On this occasion, we also pay tribute to the extraordinary courage of Alexei Navalny and stand with his wife, children, and loved ones. He sacrificed his life fighting against the Kremlin's corruption and for free and fair elections in Russia. We call on the Russian government to fully clarify the circumstances around his death. We equally call on the Russian government to free all unjustly detained prisoners and to stop the persecution of political opposition and the systematic repression of Russians' rights and freedoms. We will hold those culpable for Navalny's death accountable, including by continuing to impose restrictive measures in response to human rights violations and abuses in Russia and taking other actions.
1. We will continue to support Ukraine's right to self-defence and reiterate our commitment to Ukraine's long-term security, including by concluding and implementing bilateral security commitments and arrangements, based on the Joint Declaration of Support for Ukraine we endorsed in Vilnius last July. We are stepping up our security assistance to Ukraine and are increasing our production and delivery capabilities, to assist the country.
Ten years after the Maidan protests, we stand with the Ukrainian government and people as they buttress the foundations of their democratic state through vital reforms, especially to reinforce their justice system and rule of law, and tackle corruption. These endeavours are part of Ukraine's path to Euro-Atlantic integration. We praise Ukraine's achievements to date and welcome the European Council's decision last December to open accession negotiations with Ukraine. We welcome Ukraine's progress towards meeting the IMF Extended Fund Facility programme's conditionality.
Russia must not succeed in wrecking Ukraine's economy to make up for its failures on the battlefield. We will help Ukraine meet its urgent financing needs, and assist other vulnerable countries severely affected by the impacts of Russia's war. We strongly welcome the EU's approval of the Ukraine Facility of EUR 50 billion. It will provide crucial financial support to Ukraine until 2027. We also welcome additional economic support others have approved as we seek to close Ukraine's remaining financing gap, as well as Japan's swift delivery of its budget support in the first quarter of 2024 and Canada's new funding. We urge the approval of additional support to close Ukraine's remaining budget gap for 2024.
Ukraine's reconstruction, starting with early recovery measures, remains a key priority. We will continue to work, with the Ukrainian authorities and International Financial Institutions through the Multi-agency Donor Coordination Platform for Ukraine and by leveraging private investments. We welcome the Platform's expansion to include the Republic of Korea, Norway, Sweden, and the Netherlands. Further to the successful Japan-Ukraine Conference for Promotion of Economic Growth and Reconstruction, we look forward to the Ukraine Recovery Conferences, to be hosted in Berlin in 2024 and in Rome in 2025.
2. We call on Russia to immediately cease its war of aggression and completely and unconditionally withdraw its military forces from the internationally recognized territory of Ukraine. We call on all countries to uphold international law and in no way validate or condone Russia's attempts to acquire territory by force. We will never recognise so-called ""elections"", past and future, held by Russia in the territories of Ukraine, nor their results. Russia's stated intention to hold votes for its Presidential elections in Ukrainian regions is an outrageous violation of Ukraine's sovereignty.
We strongly condemn Russia's continuous brutal attacks on civilians and critical civil infrastructure and war crimes committed by Russian forces in Ukraine, including sexual violence. We strongly condemn Russia's human rights violations in the territories Russia occupies. We remain committed to holding those responsible accountable for their atrocities against the people of Ukraine, in line with international law. We support investigations by the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, the Prosecutor-General of Ukraine, and other national prosecutors within their jurisdictions. We welcome ongoing discussions in the Core Group, exploring the establishment of a tribunal for the crime of aggression against Ukraine. We call on Russia to release all persons it has unlawfully detained and to safely return all civilians it has illegally transferred or deported, starting with thousands of children. We welcome the International Coalition for the Return of Ukrainian Children, launched by Ukraine and Canada. We also stress the importance of advancing towards an exchange of all prisoners of war and welcome efforts in this regard by other partner countries and actors. Finally, we will continue to support Ukrainian displaced persons and refugees and protect those in need. We reiterate our support for the Council of Europe Register of Damage for Ukraine.
As Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine continues to undermine global food security, we celebrate Ukraine's success in significantly expanding food exports through the Black Sea, which will help feed the world. Thanks to Ukraine's maritime corridor and the EU's solidarity lanes, Ukraine is on track to export all grain from its 2023 harvest despite Russia's attacks on Ukrainian ports and its withdrawal from the Black Sea Grain Initiative. We will continue to help Ukraine export its grain and agricultural products to the most vulnerable nations, including through the implementation of the Grain Verification Scheme that Ukraine will lead this year. We call on Russia to cease its efforts to weaponize food supply and support safe commercial navigation of the Black Sea.
Russia's irresponsible nuclear rhetoric, its posture of strategic intimidation and its undermining of arms control regimes are unacceptable. Threats by Russia of nuclear weapon use, let alone any use of nuclear weapons by Russia, in the context of its war of aggression against Ukraine are inadmissible.
3. We will continue to raise the cost of Russia's war, degrade Russia's sources of revenue and impede its efforts to build its war machine, as demonstrated by our recently approved sanctions packages. We remain committed to fully implementing and enforcing our sanctions on Russia and adopting new measures as necessary. We continue to counter, in close cooperation with third countries, any attempts to evade and circumvent our sanctions and export control measures. We will impose additional sanctions on companies and individuals in third countries who help Russia acquire weapons or key inputs for weapons. We will also impose sanctions on those who help Russia acquire tools and other equipment that aid Russian weapons production or military-industrial development.
We will continue to apply significant pressure on Russian revenues from energy and other commodities. We will continue to take steps to tighten compliance and enforcement of the oil price cap. While working to maintain supply stability, we will respond to price cap violations, including by imposing additional sanctions measures on those engaged in deceptive practices while transporting Russian oil and against the networks Russia has developed to extract additional revenue from price cap violations. We will continue taking steps to limit Russia's future energy revenues. We will continue to impede Russia's development of future energy projects and disrupt its development of alternatives for energy shipping and other services. We will continue efforts to reduce Russia's revenues from metals.
We will continue to take action against third-country actors who materially support Russia's war including by imposing additional measures on entities, where appropriate, in third countries. We call on financial institutions to refrain from supporting Russia's war machine and we will take appropriate steps, consistent with our legal systems, to deter this behaviour. Financial institutions and other entities that facilitate Russia's acquisition of items or equipment for its defence industrial base are supporting actions that undermine the territorial integrity, sovereignty, and independence of Ukraine. We strongly condemn North Korea's exports and Russia's procurement of North Korea's ballistic missiles in direct violation of relevant UNSCRs and call upon them to immediately cease such activities. We call upon Iran to stop assisting the Russian military and its war in Ukraine. We express our concern about transfers to Russia from businesses in the People's Republic of China of dual-use materials and components for weapons and equipment for military production.
It is not right for Russia to decide if or when it will pay for the damage it has caused in Ukraine. These damages now exceed USD486 billion, according to the World Bank. Russia's obligations under international law to pay for the damage it is causing are clear. We are determined to dispel any false notion that time is on Russia's side, that destroying infrastructure and livelihoods has no consequences for Russia, or that Russia could prevail by causing Ukraine to fail economically. Russia should not be able to indefinitely delay payment it owes. We recognize the urgency of disrupting Russia's attempts to destroy the Ukrainian economy and Russia's continued failure to abide by its international law obligations. We are determined to ensure full accountability and we support Ukraine in obtaining compensation for the loss, injury and damage resulting from Russia's aggression.
We welcome the adoption of the EU legal acts concerning extraordinary revenues of central securities depositories gained from Russia's immobilised sovereign assets and encourage further steps to enable their use, consistent with applicable contractual obligations and in accordance with applicable laws. We ask our ministers to continue their work and update ahead of the Apulia Summit on all possible avenues by which immobilized Russian sovereign assets could be made use of to support Ukraine, consistent with our respective legal systems and international law.
4. As we move forward, we continue our support to Ukraine in further developing President Zelenskyy's Peace Formula and commit ourselves to supporting a comprehensive, just and lasting peace consistent with the principles of the UN Charter, international law and respectful of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. As Ukraine enters the third year of this relentless war, its government and its people can count on the G7's support for as long as it takes.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/joint-statement-group-seven-g-7-nations-leaders
Joe Biden,"February 26, 2024","Interview with Seth Meyers on NBC's ""Late Night""","THE PRESIDENT: Hello, everybody.
MEYERS: Welcome back, Mr. President.
THE PRESIDENT: It's good to be back. Why haven't you invited me earlier?
MEYERS: Well, you know, you're a busy guy. Did you think when you were here in 2014, this show would make it 10 years?
THE PRESIDENT: No.
MEYERS: Yeah. We appreciate -- we appreciate the honesty, you know. Now, you guys actually -- you've been colleagues before. You worked together. You did an episode of Parks and Recreation. We talked about it back in 2000.
THE PRESIDENT: Are you kidding me? I bragged about that all for a long, long time.
AMY POEHLER: That was really fun.
MEYERS: That was -- before president, this was the best gig you ever had.
THE PRESIDENT: And maybe the best gig I ever had, period.
MEYERS: Yeah. How was -- Amy, how was -- how was the president as a scene partner?
POEHLER: Well, it was an awesome time to go to DC because we met with the then Mr. Vice President -- Mr. President Vice President President.
MEYERS: That is right.
POEHLER: I don't want to get it wrong.
THE PRESIDENT: No. No.
POEHLER: I don't want to get it wrong. But we met people from both sides of the aisle. And then if you remember, we did that scene together, and then you said to me, how should I act? And I said, just act like what is this lady doing here? And you nailed it.
MEYERS: There's something that I've been very -- it just speaks to the air we live in now. There's a Dark Brandon conspiracy meme, and this is something that you seem to have a lot of fun with. You've co-opted. You've co-opted Dark Brandon. This is a yard sign. And do you enjoy playing around with the Dark Brandon meme?
THE PRESIDENT: No, I resent the hell out of it.
MEYERS: OK. Now, I want -- my favorite one recently is there are 18% of Americans, according to recent polling, have believe that you and Taylor Swift are actually working in cahoots. And after the Kansas City Chiefs won the Super Bowl, you -- you posted this on social media and wrote -- you wrote ""Just like we drew it up."" Now, can you -- I have you on the hotspot here. Can you confirm or deny that there is an active conspiracy between you and Ms. Swift?
THE PRESIDENT: Where are you getting this information? It's classified.
MEYERS: It's classified information?
THE PRESIDENT: That's classified information.
MEYERS: You won't share it with us.
THE PRESIDENT: I'm not going to. But I will tell you, she did endorse me in 2020.
MEYERS: She did. You might be wondering -- might be wondering, you think it might come around again?
THE PRESIDENT: I told you, it's classified.
MEYERS: I'm going to -- I'm going to ask you another question because we mentioned Parks and Rec, and Parks and Rec was a show that was about how government could actually help people. And it was a really optimistic show. Real quick, though. Well, do you believe any conspiracy theories, Amy?
POEHLER: Oh, yeah. I do have one conspiracy. I think that octopus -- an octopus is an alien.
MEYERS: OK.
POEHLER: And the bottom of the sea floor is actually the top of the Earth.
MEYERS: He's leaving. He's got to go.
POEHLER: Wait. Wait. Hey.
MEYERS: I told you to stop telling people that.
POEHLER: So, if that's wrong, don't spoil it for me.
THE PRESIDENT: I'm not. I'm not.
MEYERS: All right. So, Parks and Rec was about optimism. You, I believe, are more optimistic about this country than certainly I am, than a lot of people are. Why do you continue to be optimistic about this nation despite everything that's happened in recent years?
THE PRESIDENT: Look, I tell every world leader, and I mean this sincerely, never underestimate the ability of the American people. There's nothing beyond our capacity. Nothing. Think about it. Every single crisis we've ever, ever, ever been in, we've come out stronger than we went in. Everyone. And folks, it's because of you, not because of your leaders. Because of you, really and truly. The American people are incredible. And we're the -- you know, I've told -- I asked -- I was asked by Xi Jinping about -- when I was in the Tibetan mountains with him, and he said can you define America for me? I said, yeah, one word, possibilities. America believes anything is possible. And by the way, people step up -- people here step up. And look what's happening. We've got the best economy in the world. Now, we've got a long way to go, but the best in the world now, and we're going to get it better.
MEYERS: Well, I have a lot more to ask you about what's coming up next. You, guys, that's President Joe Biden. That's Amy Poehler. We'll be right back with more from President Biden.
[commercial break]
MEYERS: Welcome back to Late Night. We're here with President Joe Biden. You mentioned some classified materials, some documents recently leaked, some classified documents. And this isn't a gotcha show, but I do want to ask about it that says you are currently 81 years old.
THE PRESIDENT: Who the hell told you that?
MEYERS: Yeah.
THE PRESIDENT: That's classified.
MEYERS: That's classified. All jokes aside, according to recent polling, this is a real concern for American voters. How do you address that concern going forward as you come up to the 2024 election?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, a couple of things. Number one, you got to take a look at the other guy. He's about as old as I am, but he can't even remember his wife's name.
MEYERS: Yeah.
THE PRESIDENT: And -- number one. Number two, it's about how old your ideas are. Look, I mean, this is a guy who wants to take us back. He wants to take us back in Roe v. Wade. He wants to take us back on a whole range of issues that are 50, 60 years. They've been solid American positions. And -- and I really mean this sincerely. The -- I think it's about -- about the future. And everything -- every single thing we've done, I think we've gotten some good things done. Everything -- and they told us we couldn't get them done because things were so divided. And -- but I think everything -- everything we've gotten done, he's just frontally stated he wants to do away with if he gets elected. And I really think his views on where to take America are older than -- anyway, I don't want to get called.
MEYERS: You talked about bipartisanship and that you could actually work across the aisle when you ran in 2020. I was one of the people who thought that was maybe a foolish proposition. But you have gotten things done: Infrastructure, CHIPS, Inflation Reduction Act, some gun safety. You even got an immigration bill that passed in the Senate but never got taken up in the House.
THE PRESIDENT: It will be.
MEYERS: And what do you would you want to do? What's your 2024 agenda? Because I feel like we live in such crazy times that that is one of the things I feel we hear less about.
THE PRESIDENT: Look, the 2020 agenda is to finish the job. For example, we're now in a position where we have the strongest economy of any major nation in the world, number one. We've got a way to go yet. Inflation is down, 880,000 manufacturing jobs. You know, we have some 14 million new jobs. The unemployment rate is the lowest it's been for the longest time. We're building wealth for people. But it really -- we have to do more. The first thing I have to do is stop it from being turned around. For example, you -- you talked about the border, it didn't pass. Well, guess what? We're going to pass that border. It's overwhelmingly -- overwhelmingly supported by Republicans and Democrats in the House and Senate. But because, I don't know this for a fact, but I was told that Trump was picking up the phone, calling the speaker of the House, saying don't let it pass. Why? Not because he doesn't think it's good. Because it will benefit Biden. That's no way to run a country. That's no way to deal. We didn't even -- when we had real divisions back when I was a young senator among Democrats and Republicans, that -- that -- that wasn't the way it worked. And look, I think -- let me put this, it's not your father's Republican Party. This is -- they got about 30% of the Republican Party controlling it all. And -- and I think it's -- we're going to break it.
MEYERS: One of the things about this is not your father's Republican Party, it must be for somebody who's been doing this as long as you have. You can't get aid for Ukraine passed. And it seemed like for a long time, the American people agreed that Russia was a threat. And all of a sudden, now, you see a Republican Party that is basically refusing to aid Ukraine in their fight. Again, it seems like Donald Trump is saying Russia can do whatever they want to NATO countries. Are you shocked?
THE PRESIDENT: Not seems like, that's what he is saying. He's been saying it all along. He'd been saying it when he ran the last time. Look, the idea that any American -- think about this, if I told you all there was going to be an American president who said to Putin, Putin, come do whatever you want and -- to -- to NATO if they don't -- if the other guys on our team don't pay up every single cent they promised to pay for. I mean, what are we talking about here? What in God's name? How -- the idea that the president of the United States is inviting Vladimir Putin to invade Eastern or Western countries is bizarre. Absolutely bizarre. And it's totally against our interests. And by the way, I've known every major foreign leader for the longest time, and I know all these guys extremely well. They're scared to death of what it means for them -- for them, what it means if we walk away. Madeleine Albright was right, the former secretary of state. She said we are the essential nation. We are the essential nation. We don't have people fighting in those areas, but we're providing the wherewithal for them to be able to protect themselves. And it's just outrageous what he's talking about.
MEYERS: He talked about how he wants to be a dictator on day one, but only on day one. You were someone who has dealt with dictators over the years. It does seem as though democracy in vague terms somehow is not easy for us to grasp. Having dealt with dictators, what do you see in a world where democracy is actually at risk in a way it might be in this election?
THE PRESIDENT: The first thing they do -- dictators do is they disregard whatever the rule of law is. They just disregard it. Here's the guy who says he wants to -- he thinks he can change the Constitution and ignore it. Just ignore portions of the Constitution. Here's the guy who talks about retribution. Here's the guy -- look, you have the guys -- the thousands of people who stormed the Capitol -- stormed the Capitol.
MEYERS: They're insurrectionists. Two cops died. Other people were badly hurt. And what did he say? They got convicted and/or they pled guilty, and he said they're patriots. God. Patriots? And he says he's going to forgive them all. He's going to -- and he's going to -- every one of them is going to be released.
THE PRESIDENT: What is -- I mean, that -- that's what happens in Eastern European countries. That's not what happens in America. We're -- and the idea that he thinks he can do that. The idea -- he talks about things like, for example, the idea that he said the Congress wants to pass an overwhelmingly a border provision that would allow us to control the border. The first bill I've ever introduced called for that. And here, they're saying, he's saying, no, don't do that because that'll help Biden. Help Biden? It's about -- not about Biden. It's about the United States of America. And look, it just -- I don't want to get started. I really don't.
MEYERS: Yeah. I get it. I get it.
THE PRESIDENT: Our Democracy is at stake. It literally is.
MEYERS: I want to ask about the situation right now in the Middle East. You have forcefully spoken about the horrible events of October 7th and how Hamas is continuing threat to the safety of the people who live in Israel. You've been negotiating -- trying to negotiate the release of the hostages. At the same time, you've said that the response in Gaza is too much and that the loss of an innocent life in Gaza is just as horrible as the loss of an innocent life in Israel. And yet, there have been calls for an immediate cease-fire. You have not supported those calls. Again, you seem like an optimistic person. You believe maybe there's a future for a two-state solution. But from where I'm sitting, it does seem like there doesn't seem to be any appetite for that right now. Do you see -- what is -- because again, we see this horrible -- every day, we see these horrible images out of Gaza. And is there a path forward? Is there a safe future for the people who live there?
THE PRESIDENT: There is a path forward with difficulty. But here's the path forward. Look, first of all, there are -- the hostages being held must be released. And then we've got -- and it's an in-principle agreement, there will be a cease-fire while that takes place. Ramadan is coming up, and there's been an agreement by the Israelis that they would not engage in activities during Ramadan as well in order to give us time to get all the hostages out. That gives us time to begin to move in directions that a lot of Arab countries are prepared to move in. For example, Saudi Arabia is ready to recognize Israel. Jordan is -- Egypt. There are six other states I've been working with. Qatar. And the bottom line is that I'm not -- I think the only way Israel ultimately survives, and I make no bones about it, I get criticized for having said a long time ago, you need not be a Jew to be a Zionist. I'm a Zionist. Where there's no Israel, there's not a Jew in the world who'll be safe. But here's the deal. They also have to make up -- take advantage of an opportunity to have peace and security for Israelis and Palestinians who are being used as pawns by -- by the -- by Hamas. And so, there's a process underway that I think if we get that -- that temporary cease-fire, we're going to be able to move in a direction where we can change the dynamic and not have a two-state solution immediately, but a process to get to a two-state solution. A process to guarantee Israel's security and the independence of the Palestinians, but without them being able to, for example, invite in a, you know, another country to provide their defenses. There's ways to do this, and I don't have time to go into it now. But -- and in the meantime, there are too many innocent people that are being killed. And Israel has slowed down the attacks in Rafah. They have to -- and they've made a commitment to me they're going to see to it that there's an ability to evacuate significant portions of Rafah before they go and take out the remainder of Hamas. But -- but it's a process. And look, Israel has had the overwhelming support of the vast majority of nations. If it keeps this up without this incredibly conservative government they have, and Ben-Gvir and others, most -- I've known every major foreign policy leader in Israel since Golda Meir. They're going to lose support from around the world, and that is not in Israel's interest.
MEYERS: Well, I wish you the best of luck with that because they are really horrifying scenes, and I'm happy to hear you agree with that as well. I do want to close by thanking you for something. When you were here in 2014, you gave me two gifts. First, you gave me an Amtrak whistle. And -- and it was 10 years ago. I didn't have kids yet. And I have kids now, and it's their favorite thing and they blow it all the time, and it's really irritating. So, I want to give it back. And --
THE PRESIDENT: I'm not going to take it back. We're going to give it to your kids.
MEYERS: It's covered with germs. I'll say you gave me this -- this conductor's hat and this meant the world to me because when I put it on, I realized that you didn't just buy this at a store. You obviously went out of your way. You got my hat size, because when I put it on, it was such a perfect fit. And --
THE PRESIDENT: Let's get moving.
MEYERS: Let's get moving. I really want to thank you so much for being here, Mr. President. It means the world to celebrate the anniversary with you. That's President Joe Biden, everybody. We'll be right back with more Late Night.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-seth-meyers-nbcs-late-night
Joe Biden,"February 29, 2024",Statement on Congressional Passage of Continuing Appropriations Legislation,"This bipartisan agreement prevents a damaging shutdown and allows more time for Congress to work toward full-year funding bills. That's good news for the American people. But I want to be clear: This is a short-term fix, not a long-term solution.
In the days ahead, Congress must do its job and pass full-year funding bills that deliver for the American people. And House Republicans must act on the bipartisan national security supplemental, which already passed the Senate with overwhelming bipartisan support and would pass the House if it was brought to a vote.
During my meeting with congressional leaders this week, we all agreed on the vital importance of supporting Ukraine. That understanding must now be backed with action. Every day that House Republicans refuse to hold a vote on the bipartisan national security supplemental, the consequences for Ukraine grow more severe.
In addition to arming Ukraine as they defend against Russian attacks every single day, this bill will help ensure that Israel can defend itself against Hamas and other threats. And it will provide critical humanitarian aid to the Palestinian people and those impacted by conflicts around the world. Because the truth is, the aid flowing into Gaza is nowhere near enough and nowhere fast enough. Innocent lives are on the line.
It is time for House Republicans to put our national security first and move with urgency to get this bipartisan bill to my desk.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-congressional-passage-continuing-appropriations-legislation
Joe Biden,"March 07, 2024",Statement on Sweden's Accession to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization,"Today I am honored to welcome Sweden as NATO's 32nd ally.
Seventy-five years ago, when the United States and 11 other nations came together to establish the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, President Truman said the alliance ""would create a shield against aggression and fear of aggression."" Today that shield—and transatlantic security—is stronger than ever with the formal addition of Sweden to NATO.
When Putin launched his brutal war of aggression against the people of Ukraine, he thought he could weaken Europe and divide NATO. Instead, in May 2022, Sweden and Finland—two of our close partners, with two highly capable militaries—made the historic decision to apply for full NATO membership. Alliance members ratified Finland's membership last year ahead of our historic summit in Vilnius. And, with the addition of Sweden today, NATO stands more united, determined, and dynamic than ever—now 32 nations strong.
Today we once more reaffirm that our shared democratic values—and our willingness to stand up for them—is what makes NATO the greatest military alliance in the history of the world. It is what draws nations to our cause. It is what underpins our unity. And together with our newest ally, Sweden, NATO will continue to stand for freedom and democracy for generations to come. I look forward to hosting all 32 allies for the 75th anniversary NATO summit this summer in Washington, DC.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-swedens-accession-the-north-atlantic-treaty-organization
Joe Biden,"March 29, 2024",Statement on Russia's Detention of United States Citizen Evan Gershkovich,"Today we mark a painful anniversary: 1 year of American journalist Evan Gershkovich's wrongful detention in Russia.
Journalism is not a crime, and Evan went to Russia to do his job as a reporter, risking his safety to shine the light of truth on Russia's brutal aggression against Ukraine. Shortly after his wholly unjust and illegal detention, he drafted a letter to his family from prison, writing: ""I am not losing hope.""
As I have told Evan's parents, I will never give up hope either. We will continue working every day to secure his release. We will continue to denounce and impose costs for Russia's appalling attempts to use Americans as bargaining chips. And we will continue to stand strong against all those who seek to attack the press or target journalists, the pillars of free society.
To Evan, to Paul Whelan, and to all Americans held hostage or wrongfully detained abroad: We are with you. And we will never stop working to bring you home.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-russias-detention-united-states-citizen-evan-gershkovich
Joe Biden,"April 04, 2024",Statement on the 75th Anniversary of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization,"Today we celebrate a historic milestone: the 75th anniversary of NATO.
This is the greatest military alliance in the history of the world. But it didn't happen by accident, nor was it inevitable. Generation after generation, the United States and our fellow allies have chosen to come together to stand up for freedom and push back against aggression, knowing we are stronger and the world is safer when we do.
We saw this during the cold war, as we stood united against the forces of Soviet totalitarianism. We saw it again when America was attacked on September 11, 2001, and our allies invoked NATO article 5—an attack against one, is an attack against all—for the first and only time in history. And we've seen it over the last 2 years, as allies have stepped up to support the brave people of Ukraine in the face of Russia's vicious invasion, the largest war in Europe since World War II.
Today, NATO is larger, stronger, and more determined than ever before. We've added Finland and Sweden to the alliance, two democracies, with two highly capable militaries. Over the past 3 years, our NATO allies have increased their own annual defense spending by almost $80 billion. As our adversaries have plotted to break our remarkable unity, our democracies have stood unwavering. And this July, the United States will host a Washington NATO summit, bringing together our allies to modernize our defense and deterrence.
Now, like generations before us, we must choose to protect this progress and build on it. We must remember that the sacred commitment we make to our allies—to defend every inch of NATO territory—makes us safer too and gives the United States a bulwark of security unrivaled by any other nation in the world. And like our predecessors, we must ask ourselves: What can we do—what must we do—to create a more peaceful future?
Seventy-five years ago today, after signing the treaty that brought NATO into existence, President Harry Truman said: ""If there is anything certain today, if there is anything inevitable in the future, it is the will of the people of the world for freedom and for peace."" I believe that will is stronger today than ever before, and in the years ahead, I know we'll prove it.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-the-75th-anniversary-the-north-atlantic-treaty-organization
Joe Biden,"April 10, 2024",Joint Statement by President Biden and Prime Minister Fumio Kishida of Japan—Global Partners for the Future,"Over the course of the last three years, the U.S.-Japan Alliance has reached unprecedented heights. We arrived at this historic moment because our nations, individually and together, took courageous steps to strengthen our collective capacity in ways that would have seemed impossible just a few years ago. Today, we, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. and Prime Minister KISHIDA Fumio, celebrate this new era of U.S.-Japan strategic cooperation during the Prime Minister's Official Visit and State Dinner in Washington, D.C.—and pledge that the United States and Japan will continue our tireless work, together and with other partners, to realize a free and open Indo-Pacific and world.
In this new era of U.S.-Japan cooperation, we recognize that global events affect the security and stability of the Indo-Pacific, and that developments in our shared region reverberate around the world. We are therefore working together, across all domains and at all levels, to build a global partnership that is fit for purpose to address the complex, interconnected challenges of today and tomorrow for the benefit of our two countries and the world. As our Alliance cooperation reaches new heights, we are expanding our engagement to reflect the global nature of our partnership.
At the core of our cooperation is a shared commitment to work with like-minded partners and multilateral institutions to address common challenges and to ensure a world that is free, open, connected, resilient, and secure. These joint efforts are based on our shared fundamental respect for international law, including the protection and promotion of human rights and dignity, the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all states, and the prohibition on acquisition of territory by force. Our purpose as partners is to uphold and bolster the free and open international order based on the rule of law that has allowed so many nations to develop and prosper, and to ensure our Alliance is equipped to tackle the challenges of the 21st century.
To advance our global partnership, today we announce several new strategic initiatives to strengthen our defense and security cooperation; reach new frontiers in space; drive technology innovation; bolster economic security; accelerate climate action; partner on global diplomacy and development; and fortify the ties between our peoples. Through our global partnership, we are also synchronizing our strategies, and our two nations have never been more united as we work together to address the most pressing challenges and opportunities of the future.
Strengthening our Defense and Security Cooperation 
The core of our global partnership is our bilateral defense and security cooperation under the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security, which is stronger than ever. We affirm that our Alliance remains the cornerstone of peace, security, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific. President Biden reiterated the unwavering commitment of the United States to the defense of Japan under Article V of the Treaty, using its full range of capabilities, including nuclear capabilities. Prime Minister Kishida reaffirmed Japan's unwavering commitment to fundamentally reinforce its own defense capabilities and roles, and to enhance its close coordination with the United States under the Treaty. President Biden also reaffirmed that Article V applies to the Senkaku Islands. We reiterated our strong opposition to any attempts by the People's Republic of China (PRC) to unilaterally change the status quo by force or coercion in the East China Sea, including through actions that seek to undermine Japan's longstanding and peaceful administration of the Senkaku Islands. We welcome the progress in optimizing Alliance force posture in areas including the Southwestern Islands to strengthen U.S.-Japan deterrence and response capabilities, and we confirm the importance of further advancing this initiative.
The United States welcomes the steps Japan is taking to fundamentally enhance its defense capabilities, including its plans to increase the budget for its defense capabilities and complementary initiatives to two percent of GDP in Japanese Fiscal Year (JFY) 2027 in accordance with Japan's National Security Strategy, its decision to possess counterstrike capabilities, and its plans to stand up the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) Joint Operations Command to enhance command and control of the JSDF. Together, these initiatives elevate our defense ties to unprecedented levels and launch a new era of U.S.-Japan security cooperation, strengthening our Alliance and contributing to stability in the Indo-Pacific.
Today, we announce several new strategic initiatives to further advance our Alliance. Recognizing the speed at which regional security challenges evolve and to ensure our bilateral Alliance structures meet these critical changes, we announce our intention to bilaterally upgrade our respective command and control frameworks to enable seamless integration of operations and capabilities and allow for greater interoperability and planning between U.S. and Japanese forces in peacetime and during contingencies. More effective U.S.-Japan Alliance command and control will strengthen deterrence and promote a free and open Indo-Pacific in the face of pressing regional security challenges. We call on our respective defense and foreign ministries to develop this new relationship through the Security Consultative Committee (our security ""2+2""). In support of this vision, we also reaffirm our goal to deepen Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance cooperation and Alliance information sharing capabilities, including through the Bilateral Information Analysis Cell.
We will also continue to implement efforts to strengthen our Alliance force posture, build high-end base capabilities, and increase preparedness that are necessary to deter and defend against threats. We resolve to deepen bilateral cooperation toward the effective development and employment of Japan's suite of counterstrike capabilities, including the provision of U.S. materiel and technological support to enhance Japan's indigenous stand-off programs. The United States expressed its commitment to start the training pipeline and ship modifications for Japan to acquire operational capability of the Tomahawk Land Attack Missile (TLAM) system. We also reaffirmed our pursuit of a Glide Phase Interceptor (GPI) cooperative development program to counter high-end, regional hypersonic threats.
As our countries strengthen our bilateral ties, we will continue to build our relationships with like-minded partners in the region. Today, we announce our vision to cooperate on a networked air defense architecture among the United States, Japan, and Australia to counter growing air and missile threats. Recognizing Japan's strengths and the close bilateral defense partnerships with the AUKUS countries, AUKUS partners—Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States—are considering cooperation with Japan on AUKUS Pillar II advanced capability projects. Continuing the momentum from the Camp David Summit, we welcome progress on establishing an annual multidomain exercise between the United States, Japan, and the Republic of Korea (ROK). Recognizing the commitments made in the Atlantic Declaration and the Hiroshima Accord, and as the Indo-Pacific and Euro-Atlantic regions become ever more interlinked, we welcome the announcement of regular U.S.-Japan-UK trilateral exercises, beginning in 2025, as we enhance our shared and enduring security. Building on the announcement at the Australia Official Visit in October to pursue trilateral cooperation with Japan on unmanned aerial systems, we are exploring cooperative opportunities in the rapidly emerging field of collaborative combat aircraft and autonomy.
The United States welcomes Japan's revision of the Three Principles on the Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology and its Implementation Guidelines, which bolsters cooperation through joint development and production to enhance our deterrence capabilities in the region. To leverage our respective industrial bases to meet the demand for critical capabilities and maintain readiness over the long term, we will convene a Forum on Defense Industrial Cooperation, Acquisition and Sustainment (DICAS) co-led by the U.S. Department of Defense and Japan's Ministry of Defense to identify priority areas for partnering U.S. and Japanese industry, including co-development and co-production of missiles and co-sustainment of forward-deployed U.S. Navy ships and U.S. Air Force aircraft, including fourth generation fighters, at Japanese commercial facilities, in coordination with relevant ministries. This forum, in conjunction with our existing Defense Science and Technology Cooperation Group, will better integrate and align our defense industrial policy, acquisition, and science and technology ecosystems. The DICAS will provide updates on progress to the foreign and defense ministers in the security ""2+2."" We also commit to establishing a working group to explore opportunities for future fighter pilot training and readiness, including AI and advanced simulators, and co-development and co-production of cutting-edge technologies such as common jet trainers to maintain combat-ready next-generation fighter airpower.
We reaffirm the critical importance of continuing to enhance U.S. extended deterrence, bolstered by Japan's defense capabilities, and will further strengthen bilateral cooperation. In this regard, we call on our respective foreign and defense ministers to hold in-depth discussions on extended deterrence on the occasion of the next security ""2+2"" meeting.
We continue to deepen our cooperation on information and cyber security to ensure that our Alliance stays ahead of growing cyber threats and builds resilience in the information and communication technology domain. We also plan on enhancing our cooperation on the protection of critical infrastructure.
Recognizing the importance of rapidly responding to frequent and severe climate change-related and other natural disasters, we plan to explore cooperation on the establishment of a humanitarian assistance and disaster relief hub in Japan.
In order to maintain deterrence and mitigate impact on local communities, we are firmly committed to the steady implementation of the realignment of U.S. forces in Japan in accordance with Okinawa Consolidation Plan, including the construction of the Futenma Replacement Facility at Henoko as the only solution that avoids the continued use of Marine Corps Air Station Futenma.
Reaching New Frontiers in Space 
Our global partnership extends to space, where the United States and Japan are leading the way to explore our solar system and return to the Moon. Today, we welcome the signing of a Lunar Surface Exploration Implementing Arrangement, in which Japan plans to provide and sustain operation of a pressurized lunar rover while the United States plans to allocate two astronaut flight opportunities to the lunar surface for Japan on future Artemis missions. The leaders announced a shared goal for a Japanese national to be the first non-American astronaut to land on the Moon on a future Artemis mission, assuming important benchmarks are achieved. The United States and Japan plan to deepen cooperation on astronaut training to facilitate this goal while managing the risks of these challenging and inspiring lunar surface missions. We also announce bilateral collaboration on a Low Earth Orbit detection and tracking constellation for missiles such as hypersonic glide vehicles, including potential collaboration with U.S. industry.
Leading on Innovation, Economic Security, and Climate Action 
The United States and Japan aim to maximally align our economic, technology, and related strategies to advance innovation, strengthen our industrial bases, promote resilient and reliable supply chains, and build the strategic emerging industries of the future while pursuing deep emissions reductions this decade. Building on our efforts in the U.S.-Japan Competitiveness and Resilience (CoRe) Partnership, including through the U.S.-Japan Economic Policy Consultative Committee (our economic ""2+2""), we intend to sharpen our innovative edge and strengthen our economic security, including by promoting and protecting critical and emerging technologies.
The United States and Japan welcome our robust economic and commercial ties through mutual investment, including Microsoft's $2.9 billion investment in Japan on AI and cloud infrastructure, workforce training, and a research lab; and Toyota's recent additional $8 billion battery production investment for a cumulative $13.9 billion investment in North Carolina. Japan is the top foreign investor in the United States with nearly $800 billion in foreign direct investment, and Japanese companies employ nearly 1 million Americans across all 50 states. Similarly, as a top foreign investor in Japan for many years, the United States is supporting Japan's economic growth, and as two of the world's largest financial sectors, we commit to strengthening our partnership to bolster cross-border investment and support financial stability. As robust and creative economies, we also plan to accelerate investment in our respective start-up environments to foster innovation through the ""Japan Innovation Campus"" in Silicon Valley and the ""Global Startup Campus"" to be established in Tokyo, and in companies that take actions toward sustainable value creation (SX). We welcome our new Japan-U.S. personnel exchange programs on startups and venture capital firms under the Global Innovation through Science and Technology (GIST) initiative.
We are committed to strengthening our shared role as global leaders in the development and protection of next-generation critical and emerging technologies such as AI, quantum technology, semiconductors, and biotechnology through research exchange and private investment and capital finance, including with other like-minded partners. We welcome our collaboration on AI for Science between Riken and Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) founded on the revised project arrangement.
We applaud the establishment of $110 million in new AI research partnerships—between the University of Washington and University of Tsukuba and between Carnegie Mellon University and Keio University—through funding from NVIDIA, Arm, Amazon, Microsoft, and a consortium of Japanese companies. We are committed to further advancing the Hiroshima AI Process and strengthening collaboration between the national AI Safety Institutes.
Building on our long history of semiconductor cooperation, we intend to establish a joint technology agenda for cooperation on issues such as research and development, design, and workforce development. We also welcome the robust cooperation between and with our private sectors, especially in next-generation semiconductors and advanced packaging. We also plan to work together along with like-minded countries to strengthen global semiconductor supply chains, particularly for mature node (""legacy"") semiconductors through information-sharing, coordination of policies, and addressing vulnerabilities stemming from non-market policies and practices. We also celebrate the signing of a Memorandum of Cooperation between Japan's National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) and the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as a first step in bilateral cooperation on quantum computing.
Building on the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) and our respective leadership of the G7 and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) last year, we continue to advance resilience, sustainability, inclusiveness, economic growth, fairness, and competitiveness for our economies. We applaud the recent entry into force of the IPEF Supply Chain Agreement. We will continue to seek cooperation on critical minerals projects, including those along the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment Lobito Corridor, and through the Minerals Security Partnership (MSP) as well as the Partnership for Resilient and Inclusive Supply-chain Enhancement (RISE). We are cooperating to deter and address economic coercion, through our bilateral cooperation as well as through our work with like-minded partners including the G7 Coordination Platform on Economic Coercion. We are working to uphold a free, fair and rules-based economic order; address non-market policies and practices; build trusted, resilient, and sustainable supply chains; and promote open markets and fair competition under the U.S.-Japan economic ""2+2"" and the U.S.-Japan Commercial and Industrial Partnership. We will advance our commitment to operationalize data free flow with trust, including with respect to data security. We will also discuss the promotion of resilient and responsible seafood supply chains.
The United States and Japan recognize that the climate crisis is the existential challenge of our time and intend to be leaders in the global response. Towards our shared goal of accelerating the clean energy transition, we are launching a new high-level dialogue on how we implement our respective domestic measures and maximize their synergies and impacts, including the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act and Japan's Green Transformation (GX) Promotion Strategy aimed at accelerating energy transition progress this decade, promoting complementary and innovative clean energy supply chains and improving industrial competitiveness. Today we announce Japan joins as the first international collaborator of the U.S. Floating Offshore Wind Shot. We intend to work together towards global ambition in line with the Wind Shot, taking into consideration national circumstances, through the Clean Energy and Energy Security Initiative (CEESI) to pursue innovative breakthroughs that drive down technology costs, accelerate decarbonization, and deliver benefits for coastal communities. The United States welcomes Japan's newly-launched industry platform, the Floating Offshore Wind Technology Research Association (FLOWRA), aiming to reduce costs and achieve mass production of floating offshore wind through collaboration with academia.
We are further leading the way in developing and deploying next generation clean energy technology, including fusion energy development through the announcement of a U.S.-Japan Strategic Partnership to Accelerate Fusion Energy Demonstration and Commercialization.
The United States remains unwavering in its commitment to support the energy security of Japan and other allies, including its ability to predictably supply LNG while accelerating the global transition to zero-emissions energy and working with other fossil energy importers and producers to minimize methane emissions across the fossil energy value chain to the fullest extent practicable.
We intend to advance widespread adoption of innovative new clean energy technologies, and seek to increase the globally available supply of sustainable aviation fuel or feedstock, including those that are ethanol-based, that show promise in reducing emissions.
We are also working to align global health security and innovation, including in such areas as pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response and promoting more resilient, equitable, and sustainable health systems. Today, we announce that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Japan's Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) intend to collaborate and exchange information on oncology drug products to help cancer patients receive earlier access to medications and to discuss future drug development and ways to prevent drug shortages. We welcome PMDA's future representative office in Washington, D.C., to facilitate this cooperation.
Partnering on Global Diplomacy and Development 
The challenges we face transcend geography. The United States and Japan are steadfast in our commitment to upholding international law, including the UN Charter, and call for all Member States to uphold the Charter's purposes and principles, including refraining from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State. We remain committed to reforming the UN Security Council (UNSC), including through expansion in permanent and non-permanent categories of its membership. President Biden reiterated support for Japan's permanent membership on a reformed UNSC.
We reaffirm our commitment made in Hiroshima last year and are determined to further promote our cooperation in the G7 and work together with partners beyond the G7.
We emphasize the importance of all parties promoting open channels of communication and practical measures to reduce the risk of misunderstanding and miscalculation and to prevent conflict in the Indo-Pacific. In particular, we underscore the importance of candid communication with the PRC, including at the leader level, and express the intent to work with the PRC where possible on areas of common interest.
We emphasize the importance of all States being able to exercise rights and freedoms in a manner consistent with international law as reflected in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), including freedom of navigation and overflight. We strongly oppose any unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force or coercion, including destabilizing actions in the South China Sea, such as unsafe encounters at sea and in the air as well as the militarization of disputed features and the dangerous use of coast guard vessels and maritime militia. The PRC's recent dangerous and escalatory behavior supporting its unlawful maritime claims in the South China Sea as well as efforts to disrupt other countries' offshore resource exploitation are inconsistent with international law as reflected in UNCLOS. We also emphasize that the 2016 South China Sea Arbitral Award is final and legally binding on the parties to that proceeding. We resolve to work with partners, particularly in ASEAN, to support regional maritime security and uphold international law.
We emphasize that our basic positions on Taiwan remain unchanged and reiterate the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait as an indispensable element of global security and prosperity. We encourage the peaceful resolution of cross-Strait issues.
We continue working together with partner countries to make concrete progress in strengthening the international financial architecture and fostering investment under the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment. We are committed to delivering better, bigger, more effective multilateral development banks including through our planned contributions that would enable more than $30 billion in new World Bank lending and securing ambitious International Development Association and Asian Development Fund replenishments. We also emphasize the importance of private sector investment in the Indo-Pacific. We welcome the announcement of Google's $1 billion investment in digital connectivity for North Pacific Connect, which expands the Pacific Connect Initiative, with NEC, to improve digital communications infrastructure between the United States, Japan and Pacific Island Nations. Building on the U.S.-Australia joint funding commitment for subsea cables last October, the United States and Japan plan to collaborate with like-minded partners to build trusted and more resilient networks and intend to contribute funds to provide subsea cables in the Pacific region, including $16 million towards cable systems for the Federated States of Micronesia and Tuvalu.
We reaffirm our steadfast commitment to the Quad and its shared vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific that is stable, prosperous, and inclusive which continues to deliver results for the region. We reiterate the Quad's unwavering support and respect for regional institutions, including ASEAN, the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF), and the Indian Ocean Rim Association. We also reaffirm our support for ASEAN centrality and unity as well as the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific. Southeast Asian countries are critical partners in the Indo-Pacific and the U.S.-Japan-Philippines trilateral aims to enhance trilateral defense and security cooperation while promoting economic security and resilience. Japan and the United States reaffirmed our intention to work to support the region's priorities as articulated through the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent, including through the PIF as the Pacific's preeminent institution as well as through the Partners in the Blue Pacific (PBP).
As we pursue our shared vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific, we continue to build strong ties between key, like-minded partners in the region. Building on the historic success of the Camp David Trilateral Summit, the United States, Japan and the Republic of Korea continue to collaborate on promoting regional security, strengthening deterrence, coordinating development and humanitarian assistance, countering North Korea's illicit cyber activities, and deepening our cooperation including on economic, clean energy, and technological issues. The United States and Japan also remain committed to advancing trilateral cooperation with Australia to ensure a peaceful and stable region.
We reaffirm our commitment to the complete denuclearization of North Korea in accordance with relevant UNSC resolutions. We strongly condemn North Korea's continued development of its ballistic missile program—including through launches of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) and space launch vehicles using ballistic missile technologies—which poses a grave threat to peace and security on the Korean Peninsula and beyond. We call on North Korea to respond to continued, genuine offers to return to diplomacy without preconditions. We call on all UN Member States to fully implement all relevant UNSC resolutions, especially in light of Russia's recent veto. We urge North Korea to cease illicit activities that generate revenue for its unlawful ballistic missile and weapons of mass destruction programs, including malicious cyber activities. President Biden also reaffirms U.S. commitment to the immediate resolution of the abductions issue, and the two sides commit to continuing joint efforts to promote respect for human rights in North Korea.
We continue to stand together in firm opposition to Russia's brutal war of aggression against Ukraine, its strikes against Ukraine's infrastructure and the terror of Russian occupation. We are committed to continuing to impose severe sanctions on Russia and provide unwavering support for Ukraine. Together, we reiterate our call on Russia to immediately, completely, and unconditionally withdraw its forces from within the internationally recognized borders of Ukraine. Any threat or use of nuclear weapons in the context of its war of aggression against Ukraine by Russia is unacceptable. We also express serious concerns about growing North Korea-Russia military cooperation, which is supporting Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine and threatens to undermine peace and stability in Northeast Asia as well as the global non-proliferation regime.
As the linkages between the Euro-Atlantic and the Indo-Pacific regions have become stronger than ever, our two countries look forward to continuing to work together to enhance Japan-North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and NATO-Indo-Pacific Four partnerships.
We once again unequivocally condemn the terror attacks by Hamas and others on October 7 of last year, and reaffirm Israel's right to defend itself and its people consistent with international law. At the same time, we express our deep concern over the critical humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip. We affirm the imperative of securing the release of all hostages held by Hamas, and emphasize that the deal to release hostages would bring an immediate and prolonged ceasefire in Gaza. We affirm the imperative of realizing an immediate and sustained ceasefire in Gaza over a period of at least six weeks as part of a deal that would release hostages held by Hamas and allow for delivery of essential additional humanitarian assistance to Palestinians in need. We underscore the urgent need to significantly increase deliveries of life-saving humanitarian assistance throughout Gaza and the crucial need to prevent regional escalation. We reiterate the importance of complying with international law, including international humanitarian law, as applicable, including with regard to the protection of civilians. We remain committed to an independent Palestinian state with Israel's security guaranteed as part of a two-state solution that enables both Israelis and Palestinians to live in a just, lasting, and secure peace.
We reaffirm the importance of supporting inclusive growth and sustainable development in Latin America and the Caribbean. We continue to enhance policy coordination in the region, in particular on Haiti and Venezuela. We also recognize that promoting the stability and security for Haiti is one of the most pressing challenges in the Western Hemisphere, and we continue to support Haiti in restoring democratic order.
We also support African aspirations for peace, stability, and prosperity based on the rule of law. We continue to work together to support the democratic process and economic growth through our respective efforts, including our cooperation with African countries, Regional Economic Communities, the African Union, and multilateral organizations.
The United States and Japan are resolved to achieve a world without nuclear weapons through realistic and pragmatic approaches. It is critical that the overall decline in global nuclear arsenals achieved since the end of the Cold War continues and not be reversed, and the PRC's accelerating build-up of its nuclear arsenal without transparency nor meaningful dialogue poses a concern to global and regional stability. We reaffirm the importance of upholding the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) as the cornerstone of the global nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime and for the pursuit of peaceful uses of nuclear energy. In promoting this universal goal of achieving a world without nuclear weapons, Japan's ""Hiroshima Action Plan"" and the ""G7 Leaders' Hiroshima Vision on Nuclear Disarmament"" are welcome contributions. The two leaders also welcomed the U.S. announcement to join the Japan-led ""Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty Friends"" initiative. We reaffirm the indispensable role of the peaceful uses of nuclear technology, committing to fostering innovation and supporting the International Atomic Energy Agency's efforts in upholding the highest standards of safety, security, and safeguards. President Biden commended Japan's safe, responsible, and science-based discharge of Advanced Liquid Processing System treated water at Tokyo Electric Power Company's Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station into the sea. Our two countries plan to launch the Fukushima Daiichi Decommissioning Partnership focusing on research cooperation for fuel debris retrieval.
To effectively address the myriad challenges outlined above, our global partnership is launching a Deputy Secretary of State/Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs-level dialogue involving our respective aid agencies to align our diplomatic and development efforts globally.
Fortifying People-to-People Ties 
People-to-people exchanges are the most effective way to develop the future stewards of the U.S.-Japan relationship. In this regard, we recognize the achievements of exchange programs between our two countries, including the Japan Exchange and Teaching (JET) Programme, KAKEHASHI Project, the Japan Foundation's programs, and the U.S.-Japan Council's TOMODACHI Initiative, and commit ourselves to providing more opportunities to meet today's needs, including through enhanced subnational exchanges on critical issues such as climate and energy. We also recognize the important role civil society has played in strengthening the U.S.-Japan relationship over the past 170 years, including the 38 Japan-America Societies across the United States, the Asia Society, and the 29 America-Japan Societies across Japan.
Building on the Memorandum of Cooperation in Education signed between us on the sidelines of the G7 Leaders' Summit in Hiroshima, today we announce our commitment to increase student mobility through the new $12 million ""Mineta Ambassadors Program (MAP)"" education exchange endowment administered by the U.S.-Japan Council for U.S. and Japanese high school and university students who will ""map"" the future of the relationship with support from Apple, the BlackRock Foundation, Toshizo Watanabe Foundation, and other founding donors. In this regard, we also welcome Japan's new initiative to expand scholarship for Japanese students through the Japan Student Servicers Organization.
We recognize the significant contributions made by the binational Japan-U.S. Educational Commission (Fulbright Japan) over the past 72 years. We welcome recent changes to upgrade the program by reopening scholarships to Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) fields for the first time in 50 years, with the first STEM students on track to participate in academic year 2025-26, as well as removing the tuition cap for Japanese Fulbright participants to attract the highest quality students and researchers.
Celebrating the 30th anniversary of the establishment of the Mansfield Fellowship Program, we honor the legacy of Ambassador Mansfield's contributions through the University of Montana Mansfield Center and Mansfield Foundation. The two leaders also welcome the creation of the Government of Japan endowed Mansfield Professor of Japanese and Indo-Pacific Affairs at the University of Montana.
Upon the 100th anniversary of the birth of the late Senator Daniel K. Inouye, who made incredible contributions to our bilateral relationship, we praise the efforts of Japanese American leaders to build a bridge between the two countries and to address common community issues, including through support to the U.S.-Japan Council's newly launched TOMODACHI Kibou for Maui project. We also share the recognition on the importance of exchanges between our legislatures. We acknowledge the importance of language study, particularly in person, to develop long-term ties and announce a new Memorandum of Cooperation to increase opportunities for the number of exchange visitors from Japan to share their specialized knowledge of Japanese language and culture in the United States, as well as welcome efforts to expand the Japanese Language Education Assistant Program (J-LEAP).
The two leaders also affirm that women in leadership remain their focus and reaffirm our pledge to achieving gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls in all their diversity. We welcome close cooperation on Women, Peace, and Security and Women's Economic Empowerment initiatives and efforts to promote women and girls' full, equal, and meaningful participation and leadership in public life.
Finally, we emphasize the need to build a diverse pipeline of future U.S.-Japan experts who understand and support the Alliance. Our peoples form the core of our Alliance, and we reaffirm our commitment to forge ever-closer bonds for generations to come.
Through our shared and steadfast commitment, we have taken bold and courageous steps to bring the U.S.-Japan Alliance to unprecedented heights. In so doing, we have equipped our partnership to protect and advance peace, security, prosperity, and the rule of law across the Indo-Pacific and the globe so that everyone benefits. Today, we celebrate the enduring friendship among our peoples—and among ourselves—and pledge to continue our relentless efforts to ensure that our global partnership drives future peace and prosperity for generations to come.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/joint-statement-president-biden-and-prime-minister-fumio-kishida-japan-global-partners-for
Joe Biden,"April 11, 2024","Joint Statement by President Biden, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida of Japan, and President Ferdinand R. ""Bongbong"" Marcos, Jr., of the Philippines","We, the leaders of Japan, the Philippines, and the United States, met today for the first Summit between our three countries. As three Indo-Pacific maritime democracies, our nations and the half-billion people we collectively represent are bound together by historical ties of friendship, robust and growing economic relations, and a proud and resolute commitment to our shared fundamental values of freedom, democracy, respect for human rights, and the rule of law. We gather today in Washington as equal partners and trusted friends, united by the vision we share of a free and open Indo-Pacific and international order based on international law—a vision we pledge to advance together for decades to come. We believe, fundamentally, that by working together, we can advance the security and prosperity of our own nations, the Indo-Pacific region, and the world.
Our historic Summit today is the culmination of decades of partnership and builds on the recent momentum of our governments' trilateral efforts. In June 2023, our national security advisors met in Tokyo, and again virtually in December 2023, to establish a common framework for trilateral cooperation among our nations. In July and September 2023, our foreign ministers met to advance our shared agenda on economic security, development, humanitarian assistance, maritime security, and defense. In September 2023, Prime Minister Kishida, President Marcos, and Vice President Harris met to deepen our trilateral cooperation. Following today's Summit, we intend to further expand trilateral engagements across our governments and to intensify our cooperative efforts across sectors.
Our three nations share a firm commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific that is connected, prosperous, secure, inclusive, and resilient. We welcome coordination and cooperation with a wide range of partners who share these goals. In that spirit, we affirm our unwavering support for ASEAN centrality and unity, and the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific. We underscore our support for Pacific Island countries and intend to transparently and effectively work in partnership with the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) to support the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent. Additionally, we welcome efforts to support a peaceful and stable, rules-based Indo-Pacific region, including from the Quad, AUKUS, and the U.S.-Japan-Republic of Korea trilateral framework.
Promoting Inclusive Economic Growth and Economic Resilience 
Our three nations resolve to promote enduring, inclusive economic growth and resilience in our countries and the broader Indo-Pacific. We are pursuing economic projects that advance our shared objectives: promoting broad-based and sustainable economic growth, and investing in resilient, reliable, and diversified supply chains. We support the continued progress of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) to advance resilience, sustainability, inclusiveness, economic growth, fairness, and competitiveness for our economies and the broader region. President Marcos welcomes President Biden's recent Presidential Trade and Investment Mission to the Philippines and the announcement of more than $1 billion in U.S. private sector investments that help promote the Philippines' innovation economy, clean energy transition, and supply chain resilience, as well as the continued U.S. commitment to mobilizing private sector investment in the Philippines. President Marcos appreciates Japan's contribution of Official Development Assistance and private sector investment in its 2022-2023 fiscal year, which exceeded the pledge of JPY 600 billion made in the 2023 Japan-Philippines Joint Statement. We welcome the first trilateral commerce and industry ministers' meeting that took place earlier today to advance our shared agenda. Our three nations commit to facilitating the steady implementation of ongoing and future economic cooperation projects toward the Philippines' attainment of upper middle income country status and beyond.
We express concern over and strongly oppose economic coercion, stress the importance of a rules-based economic order, and underscore the need for close coordination in dealing with economic coercion.
Announcing the Luzon Corridor 
Our three nations are proud to partner on the first Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment corridor in the Indo-Pacific. Today we are launching the Luzon Economic Corridor, which will support connectivity between Subic Bay, Clark, Manila, and Batangas in the Philippines. Through this corridor, part of the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment-IPEF Accelerator, Japan, the Philippines, and the United States commit to accelerating coordinated investments in high-impact infrastructure projects, including rail; ports modernization; clean energy and semiconductor supply chains and deployments; agribusiness; and civilian port upgrades at Subic Bay. Japan has long been supporting connectivity in this area, including rails and roads, through Japan International Cooperation Agency. We plan to work with multilateral organizations and the private sector to attract quality, transformative investments. Together we intend to hold a trilateral event promoting investment in the Luzon Corridor on the margins of the Indo-Pacific Business Forum in Manila in May—the premier U.S. commercial event in the region. The U.S. International Development Finance Corporation also intends to open a regional office in the Philippines to facilitate further investments across the Philippines. The Luzon Corridor is a demonstration of our enhanced economic cooperation, focused on delivering tangible investments across multiple sectors. Japan, the Philippines, and the United States are also partnering to expand cooperation and investments in other areas of the Philippines.
Developing Critical and Emerging Technologies 
We commit to harnessing the talents and ingenuity of our citizens to seize cutting-edge technological opportunities. The United States, subject to Congressional notification, and Japan, with support from Japanese industry, intend to provide at least $8 million for Open Radio Access Network (RAN) field trials and the Asia Open RAN Academy based in Manila, to enable future commercial deployment and an open, interoperable, secure, reliable, and trusted information communications technology ecosystem in the Philippines. This builds on prior U.S. and Japanese investment of over $9 million for these projects in the Philippines. The government of Japan is also seriously considering further investments for the potential commercial deployment of Open RAN technology in the Philippines, including from the Global South Future-Oriented Co-Creation Project. The United States and Japan welcome the Philippines' plan to pilot Open RAN in its national broadband program and free Wi-Fi project. The United States and Japan commend the Philippines' commitment to develop a national Open RAN policy framework, reaffirming the Philippines' endorsement of open, interoperable, and trusted architectures. This year, our three countries look forward to holding the first trilateral Cyber and Digital Dialogue to explore additional cooperation opportunities.
We intend to pursue a new semiconductor workforce development initiative, through which students from the Philippines will receive world-class training at leading American and Japanese universities, to help secure our nations' semiconductor supply chains. This initiative complements the expansion of semiconductor investments in the Philippines that would strengthen supply chain resiliency among our three nations. Furthermore, through the CHIPS and Science Act's International Technology Security and Innovation Fund, the United States and the Philippines plan to coordinate our efforts to develop and expand the Philippine semiconductor workforce to strengthen the global supply chain.
Advancing Climate Partnership and Clean Energy Supply Chains 
Recognizing the existential threat of the climate crisis, we affirm our commitment to take urgent action this decade to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in line with a 1.5 degrees Celsius warming limit and accelerate efforts to build clean energy economies, while noting different national circumstances. Our three nations seek to expand trilateral cooperation in the Philippines on the deployment of clean energy technologies, including renewable energy projects such as solar and wind, to support energy requirements in the Philippines and help ensure a just energy transition. We also welcome the first Nuclear Energy Summit in Brussels on March 21, where participants from more than 35 countries, including Japan, the Philippines, and the United States, recognized nuclear energy as an important component of a multifaceted and inclusive clean energy transition. Recognizing the Philippines' request for further training and capacity building for scientists, engineers, and relevant personnel and policy-makers, our three nations seek to expand our partnership on safe and secure civil-nuclear capacity building. Under the Foundational Infrastructure for Responsible Use of Small Modular Reactor Technology (FIRST) program, the United States and Japan plan to co-host a nuclear energy study tour in Japan for nuclear experts and policy decision-makers from the Philippines and other FIRST partner countries. We also plan to deepen trilateral cooperation on civilian nuclear workforce development through a trilateral dialogue this year, to advance the Philippines' civil nuclear energy program.
Japan, the Philippines, and the United States are working together to expand cooperation for the transition to clean energy and create high-standard, clean energy supply chain jobs across our three nations through the mutually beneficial development of resources in clear, transparent, and fair market competition with strong protections for labor rights and the environment. Japan, the Philippines, and the United States support critical minerals industries in all of our countries as a way to promote resilient and reliable global supply chains for critical minerals. We share the goal of producing and supplying battery materials and batteries for electric vehicles and energy storage systems for the global marketplace. The United States, under the International Visitor Leadership Program, plans to manage a clean energy supply chain training program for select participants from Japan and the Philippines. In addition, the United States and Japan look forward to the Philippines being a founding member of the Minerals Security Partnership Forum, which signifies an important step towards securing and diversifying our collective clean energy supply chains.
Partnering for Peace and Security 
Today, President Biden reaffirms the ironclad U.S. alliance commitments to both Japan and the Philippines, which have helped safeguard peace and security in the Indo-Pacific for decades. We underscore our nations' unwavering commitment to freedom of navigation and overflight, and the importance of respecting the sovereign rights of states within their exclusive economic zones consistent with international law, as reflected in the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).
We express our serious concerns about the People's Republic of China's (PRC) dangerous and aggressive behavior in the South China Sea. We are also concerned by the militarization of reclaimed features and unlawful maritime claims in the South China Sea. We steadfastly oppose the dangerous and coercive use of Coast Guard and maritime militia vessels in the South China Sea, as well as efforts to disrupt other countries' offshore resource exploitation. We reiterate serious concern over the PRC's repeated obstruction of Philippine vessels' exercise of high seas freedom of navigation and the disruption of supply lines to Second Thomas Shoal, which constitute dangerous and destabilizing conduct. The final and legally binding July 12, 2016 Arbitral Tribunal determined that this feature lies within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone, and we call on the PRC to abide by the ruling.
We express our serious concerns regarding the situation in the East China Sea, and reiterate our strong opposition to any attempts by the PRC to unilaterally change the status quo by force or coercion in the East China Sea, including through actions that seek to undermine Japan's longstanding and peaceful administration of the Senkaku Islands.
We affirm the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait as an indispensable element of global security and prosperity, recognize that there is no change in our basic positions on Taiwan, and call for a peaceful resolution of cross-Strait issues.
We welcome recent cooperation among our three nations in support of a free and open Indo-Pacific and commit to deepening that cooperation. The U.S. and Japan continue to support Philippine Coast Guard capacity building, including through Japan's recent provision of twelve Coast Guard vessels and plans to provide five additional vessels to the Philippines. Following the first-ever joint exercise between our coast guards in 2023, the United States looks forward to welcoming Philippine and Japan Coast Guard members onto a U.S. Coast Guard vessel during a patrol in the Indo-Pacific this year. Within the next year, our coast guards also plan to conduct an at-sea trilateral exercise and other maritime activities in the Indo-Pacific to improve interoperability and advance maritime security and safety. We announce the establishment of a trilateral maritime dialogue to enhance coordination and collective responses to promote maritime cooperation. We are concerned about illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing. We support the ability of Filipino and Japanese fisherfolk to pursue their traditional livelihoods. To build regional capacity and address threats posed by transnational crime, illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, and other maritime challenges, Japan, the Philippines, and the United States plan to expand our efforts to provide maritime law enforcement training and support to partner countries in the region.
Our three nations pledge to strengthen our extensive coordination to promote maritime domain awareness and deepen cooperation on humanitarian assistance and disaster relief. We emphasize our commitment to advancing multilateral maritime domain awareness cooperation through such venues as the Indo-Pacific Partnership for Maritime Domain Awareness (IPMDA). We intend to identify and implement opportunities for combined training with Southeast Asian regional partners. We are also launching a Japan-Philippines-U.S. humanitarian assistance and disaster response exercise, which could be integrated into trilateral or multilateral activities, including Balikatan 2025, to ensure our countries are ready and able to work together seamlessly and expeditiously in response to any crisis or contingency. We resolve to advance trilateral defense cooperation, including through combined naval training and exercises between our three countries and additional partners, such as the recently concluded Maritime Cooperative Activity between Japan, the Philippines, the United States, and Australia, and by coordinating U.S. and Japanese support for Philippine defense modernization priorities. We plan to conduct a maritime training activity around Japan in 2025. Japan also continues to contribute through its new ""Official Security Assistance"" cooperation framework. The U.S. and the Philippines welcome Japan's revision of the Three Principles on the Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology and its Implementation Guidelines, which bolsters cooperation through joint development and production to enhance our deterrence capabilities in the region. The U.S. and Japan also welcome the growing defense cooperation between Australia and the Philippines and between the Philippines and the Republic of Korea.
Our three nations affirm our commitment to the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and strongly condemn the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's (DPRK) escalatory threats and unprecedented number of ballistic missile launches, including multiple intercontinental ballistic missile launches, which pose a grave threat to peace and security. We emphasize the importance of addressing the human rights and humanitarian concerns of the international community, including the immediate resolution of the abductions issue. We strongly urge the DPRK to comply with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions, and refrain from continued development, testing, and transfer of ballistic missiles to any country, including Russia, which has used these missiles against Ukraine. We assert that these DPRK actions have severe security implications for the Indo-Pacific and European regions. As we continue to affirm our commitment to international law, including the United Nations Charter, we reiterate our unwavering support for Ukraine's sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders. To that end, we recall the United Nations General Assembly resolutions stating that no territorial acquisition resulting from the threat or use of force shall be recognized as legal. Russia's threats of nuclear weapon use in the context of Russia's invasion of Ukraine are unacceptable, and we state unequivocally that any use of a nuclear weapon by Russia in Ukraine would be completely unjustifiable.
We reaffirm our joint pursuit of a world without nuclear weapons, with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty as its cornerstone, and call on nuclear weapon states to promote stability and transparency, and engage in substantive dialogue on reducing nuclear risks. As founding members of the ""FMCT Friends,"" we also call for the immediate commencement of long-overdue negotiations on a treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons.
We are committed to championing gender equality and the rights of women and girls in all their diversity. In this regard, we commit to strengthening the Women, Peace and Security (WPS) Agenda. We highlight the leading role of women in preventing violent conflict, delivering relief and recovery efforts and pledge to advance the full, equal and meaningful participation of women in peace and political processes. We welcome the Philippines hosting an International Conference on Women, Peace, and Security in October this year, to review global implementation of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 ahead of its 25th Anniversary in 2025.
Finally, we underscore the importance of strong democratic institutions, the rule of law, and respect for human rights, gender equality, and human dignity. We represent proud, resilient democracies, mindful of our respective challenges but determined to overcome them, and we remain committed to safeguarding the human rights, media freedom, and labor rights of our people. These democratic values form the very foundation of our bilateral relationships and this trilateral partnership. These ideals have helped us build and sustain the mutual trust between us as leaders and between our people. United by these shared values, we commit to continuing our work together to address the consequential issues of our time, and to build a better future for future generations across our nations, the Indo-Pacific, and the world.
A new trilateral chapter between our three nations begins today.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/joint-statement-president-biden-prime-minister-fumio-kishida-japan-and-president-ferdinand

Joe Biden,"May 23, 2024",Joint Statement by President Biden and President William Ruto of Kenya—The Nairobi-Washington Vision,"We, the leaders of the United States and Kenya, are determined to lead a global transition to the economies of the future. We share a common vision for sustainable development and prosperity. We are determined to lead a global coalition to accelerate investments toward clean and resilient economies and supply chains and to provide a better future for our people. Investment is critical for the United States and other advanced economies, and it is equally critical for Kenya and countries around the world to succeed in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, bringing benefits to the entire world.
Mounting debt burdens, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and the food insecurity crisis fueled by Russia's war against Ukraine, have put these critical investments out of reach for too many developing countries. More than half of low-income countries are now at high risk of or in debt distress. In fact, a growing number of developing countries' debt payments to the rest of the world are greater than what they are receiving in new financing. As a result, many countries are facing difficult choices between paying back creditors and making critical investments in their economy and people—like vaccinating children, building more resilient and sustainable food systems, and addressing the damaging effects of climate change.
Even countries like Kenya which are showing strong signs of economic recovery and investor confidence are allocating a large share of tax revenues on external debt service payments. In cases like Kenya's, the macroeconomic outlook is encouraging, but access to international financial markets has been limited, with funding too expensive which worsens the public debt burden. It is important that the world use all tools in the international financial architecture to create fiscal space and enhance the ability for countries to make critical investments.
Today, we are jointly calling for bold action from the international community to expand support for developing countries to invest in their futures. Countries willing to commit to ambitious reforms and high-quality plans for investments in sustainable development and in addressing global challenges like climate change, pandemics and health threats, and fragility and conflict should be buoyed not abandoned by the international community to meet these ambitions. Our shared vision not only looks to offer a better deal for such countries today but also to help build for more resilient and inclusive economies going forward.
Specifically, the Nairobi-Washington Vision brings together the following elements:
High-ambition countries receive high-ambition financial support. Countries with high ambition with respect to investments in their own development, addressing cross-border challenges like the clean energy transition and strengthening health systems to be better prepared to respond to the next pandemic, and undertaking economic reforms to make these investments sustainable are met by high ambition from international financial institutions, including the IMF and World Bank, and from official bilateral creditors.
International financial institutions step up with coordinated packages of support so high ambition countries don't have to choose between servicing their debts and making necessary investments in their futures. International financial institutions ensure their programs account for the fiscal space high-ambition countries require for needed investment. Together, the IMF and MDBs deliver enhanced, coordinated support packages that capitalize on new and expanded resources, including by maximizing the right mix of financing; scaling up concessional financing with stepped-up support from donors; and fully utilizing sustainability-focused funds, the broader climate finance architecture, and other pools of concessional finance.
Creditor countries provide reprieves for high-ambition developing countries. Official bilateral creditors pledge to sustain positive net inflows by offering debt suspensions, reprofilings or restructurings, or new budget-support flows as necessitated by countries' debt sustainability and investment needs. Free-riding from individual creditors who get paid back from multilateral support should come to an end, and the IMF should enforce this norm as well as equitable treatment more broadly with its policies, including lending into official arrears. Creditor countries should also maximize their use of grant and development finance institution flows to support countries' development and climate needs.
New tools facilitate private sector finance on better terms. MDBs and national development finance institutions (DFIs) provide incentives to private sector creditors to replace or refinance high-cost private sector sovereign loans and debt with lower-cost, longer-term, and more transparent and resilient debt. This includes by expanding access to debt guarantees and by creating safe harbors for countries that proactively and voluntarily manage debt burdens, such as through new concessional finance, debt swaps, and debt conversions.
Transparent, sustainable, and resilient financing replaces opaque and unsustainable lending. For example, all creditors should adopt clauses to automatically provide sovereign debt service suspension when debtor countries experience climate-related disasters. Non-disclosure agreements that keep citizens and their creditors in the dark about the terms of sovereign lending should no longer be used.
Enhanced support crowds in private investment. Private sector-focused MDBs and bilateral official creditors, including through DFIs, enhance support for private investments in sustainable finance by scaling up vehicles that help mobilize private capital and deepen local capital markets. Through these and other tools, the private sector is incentivized to expand their portfolio for climate-related development finance in emerging economies.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/joint-statement-president-biden-and-president-william-ruto-kenya-the-nairobi-washington
Joe Biden,"June 08, 2024",Joint Statement by President Biden and President Emmanuel Macron of France—French-American Roadmap,"1. Following the ceremonies of the 80th anniversary of the Normandy landings, the President of the French Republic Emmanuel Macron hosted the President of the United States Joseph R. Biden Jr. in Paris for a State visit, highlighting the deep historic ties and the shared values between France and the United States. Reflecting on their historical relationship and recalling the price for peace and freedom paid by past generations in both countries, the Presidents reaffirm their commitment to a Europe, whole, free, and at peace.
Ukraine 
2. The Presidents reaffirm their strong condemnation of Russia's war against Ukraine and reject Russia's attempted annexation of sovereign Ukrainian territory, in clear violation of international law, including the United Nations Charter. Russia's irresponsible nuclear rhetoric and disregard of arms control regimes are unacceptable. In that context, France and the United States reaffirm their continued support for Ukraine's defense of its sovereignty and territorial integrity, including through the continued provision of political, security, humanitarian, and economic assistance to Ukraine. The United States and France confirm their support for a comprehensive, just, and durable peace, respectful of international law, and will continue working with partners and allies to coordinate assistance efforts to allow Ukraine to fully exercize its right of self-defense, as reflected in Article 51 of the UN Charter.
3. The Presidents discussed options to do more to support Ukraine; Euro-atlantic security as a whole is at stake in this war. France and the United States co-chair the artillery coalition at the Ukraine Defense Contact Group and intend to take new steps to provide the necessary support to Ukraine in the current phase and in the longer term. France and the United States remain determined to dispel any false notion that time is on Russia's side; the Presidents commit to support efforts within the European Union and by the G7 to bring forward the extraordinary profits from the immobilized Russian sovereign assets for the benefit of Ukraine, consistent with international law and our respective legal systems and decision-making processes.
4. The Presidents also expressed strong concern about transfers of weapons, especially from Iran and Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and dual-use materials and components for military production from businesses in the People's Republic of China and other countries, that Russia is using to rebuild its military and defense industrial base to pursue its war against Ukraine. The United States and France support actions to curtail access to the U.S. and French financial systems for those who engage in such transfers. France and the United States share a common commitment to support the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe's work to spotlight and document abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law by Russia's forces.
5. The United States and France remain committed to mitigating the tragic humanitarian and human rights consequences of the war as well as its effects on global food security, energy, nuclear safety and security, and the environment.
NATO 
6. France and the United States reaffirm their intent to defend each other and every inch of Allied territory at all times, protect their citizens, and safeguard freedom and democracy, in accordance with their commitments as NATO Allies. France and the United States are strengthening their collective defense, based on a 360-degree approach, against all threats and from all directions. The leaders reaffirmed the importance of strengthening the NATO-EU strategic partnership and promoting a stronger and more capable European defense underpinning the European pillar of transatlantic security that contributes positively to collective security. The United States supports European Allies' and partners' growing investments in military capabilities that enable our shared defense, in complementarity with NATO.
Moldova, Western Balkans, and South Caucasus 
7. France and the United States intend to continue to work with Moldova and other partners to strengthen Moldova's resilience to Russia's destabilization attempts, diversify its energy supply, and fortify its democratic institutions and human rights protections, to advance its European integration.
8. France and the United States welcomed continued close cooperation on the integration of the Western Balkans into the European Union in order to increase prosperity and fortify democratic governance and the rule of law. They welcome the opportunity to strengthen joint engagement in the Western Balkans, including through cooperation between the European Union (EU) and NATO, the EU-facilitated dialogue on the normalization of relations between Kosovo and Serbia, and by supporting key reforms for EU integration. As witness of the Dayton-Paris Agreements, France and United States reaffirm their support for the Office of the High Representative and will continue to firmly protect Bosnia and Herzegovina's sovereignty, territorial integrity, and multiethnic character. They call on leaders in Bosnia and Herzegovina to reject the path of division and secession and instead work together to make the reforms needed to join the EU. They urge the new government in North Macedonia to stay focused on the EU path and abide by their international commitments.
9. The United States and France affirm their commitment to standing with the people of Georgia in their Euro-Atlantic aspirations. The Presidents urge the Georgian Dream ruling party to respect the public's wishes by returning to the Euro-Atlantic path. The United States and France support the establishment of a fair and lasting peace in the South Caucasus, based on the respect of international law as well as the principles of sovereignty, inviolability of borders and territorial integrity. They support further regional integration in the South Caucasus for the benefit of all the region's people.
Middle East 
10. In the Middle East, France and the United States are committed to pursue their joint efforts to de-escalate and avoid regional conflagration.
11. France and the United States call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and reiterate that all hostages are to be released immediately, without preconditions. The Presidents reiterate their grave concern for the dire humanitarian crisis in Gaza, and call for the delivery of vital humanitarian aid at scale to the civilian population and unhindered and sustained humanitarian access through all routes into and inside Gaza. They also reiterate the need for Israel to do more to effectively protect Palestinian civilians and humanitarian workers. They reaffirm their commitment to a two-state solution, the only way to ensure lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians.
12. They particularly underline the utmost importance of preserving the stability of Lebanon and de-escalation on the Blue Line, and will work together to reach this goal. Both countries call on all parties to exert maximum restraint and responsibility consistent with UNSCR1701. In this context, France and the United States underline the urgency to bring an end to Lebanon's 18month long presidential vacuum and to proceed without further delay with the election of a president, the formation of a government, and the implementation of the reforms necessary to stabilize the Lebanese economy and lay the foundations for recovery and sustainable inclusive growth.
13. They reaffirmed their determination to increase pressure on Iran to curb its destabilizing regional activities, nuclear escalation and missile proliferation, halt its support to Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine, secure its full cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency, and pave the way for a future negotiated solution that ensures its nuclear program is exclusively peaceful. They stand ready to adopt further sanctions and take other measures to counter Iranian destabilising activities and to prevent transfers of Iranian missiles to Russia. They also reiterate deep concern over Iran's human rights violations and abuses, especially against women, girls, and minority groups. We call on Iran's leadership to end all arbitrary detentions.
Africa 
14. France and the United States are committed to partnering with African countries on shared global priorities, including inclusive global economic growth, combatting the climate crisis, digital transformation, good governance and security, food security, and global health. They welcomed the African Union as a permanent member of the G20 and will work with African countries to ensure they are fully represented in international institutions. They support African partners and regional organizations in their efforts to bring peace, stability and good governance to the region, while investing in inclusive and sustainable development, human capital, and infrastructure as a key driver of economic growth.
15. The United States and France are also deeply concerned by the deterioration of the governance, security, and humanitarian situation in Sudan, the Sahel, Great Lakes, and other crises. They strongly condemn ongoing human rights violations committed by multiple parties including Russian proxies as well as national armed forces, the shrinking of democratic space and rise in disinformation. France and the United States call on all belligerents in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to immediately cease hostilities, for Rwanda to withdraw and stop supporting M23, for DRC to stop any collaboration with FDLR and other armed groups, and for all actors to respect international humanitarian law. The Presidents continue to be supportive of regional diplomatic efforts and commend in particular the mediation led by the President of Angola, and call on all parties to de-escalate, protect civilian populations, and participate constructively in dialogue to create conditions for a negotiated solution leading to a lasting peace. The Presidents commit to consulting on their respective approaches in Western Africa, including in the Sahel. The United States and France are committed to advancing mediation efforts to find a political solution to the Sudan crisis as well as to support increased, sustained and vital humanitarian assistance to the Sudanese population.
Indo-Pacific

It is not right for Russia to decide if or when it will pay for the damage it has caused in Ukraine. Russia's obligations under international law to pay for the damage it is causing are clear, and so we are continuing to consider all possible lawful avenues by which Russia is made to meet those obligations.
We remain determined to dispel any false notion that time is on Russia's side, that destroying infrastructure and livelihoods has no consequences for Russia, or that Russia can prevail by causing Ukraine to fail economically. With a view to supporting Ukraine's current and future needs in the face of a prolonged defense against Russia, the G7 will launch ""Extraordinary Revenue Acceleration (ERA) Loans for Ukraine"", in order to make available approximately USD 50 billion in additional funding to Ukraine by the end of the year.
Therefore, without prejudice to possible other contributions and standing together, the G7 intends to provide financing that will be serviced and repaid by future flows of extraordinary revenues stemming from the immobilization of Russian Sovereign Assets held in the European Union and other relevant jurisdictions. To enable this, we will work to obtain approval in these jurisdictions to use future flows of these extraordinary revenues to service and repay the loans. We confirm that, consistent with all applicable laws and our respective legal systems, Russia's sovereign assets in our jurisdictions will remain immobilized until Russia ends its aggression and pays for the damage it has caused to Ukraine. We will maintain solidarity in our commitment to providing this support to Ukraine.
We intend to disburse this financing through multiple channels that direct the funds to Ukraine's military, budget, and reconstruction needs - within the constraints of our respective legal systems and administrative requirements. As it relates to reconstruction, we will also strengthen the Ukraine Multi-Donor Coordination Platform to help coordinate the disbursal of funds and ensure they align with Ukraine's highest priority needs at a pace it can effectively absorb. This will play a key role in advancing Ukraine's reforms in line with its European path.
In light of the above, we task our relevant Ministers and officials to operationalize these commitments in time for ERA to begin disbursing before year-end.
As we reiterated in our Statement on Ukraine in February, Ukraine is defending its freedom, sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity, against Russia's brutal and unjustifiable war of aggression. We continue to condemn in the strongest possible terms Russia's blatant breach of international law, including the UN Charter and of basic principles that underpin the international order. Any use of nuclear weapons by Russia in the context of its war of aggression against Ukraine would be inadmissible. We therefore condemn in the strongest possible terms Russia's irresponsible and threatening nuclear rhetoric as well as its posture of strategic intimidation, including its announced deployment of nuclear weapons in Belarus. We remain committed to holding those responsible accountable for their atrocities against the people of Ukraine, in line with international law. We also condemn the seizures of foreign companies and call on Russia to reverse these measures and seek acceptable solutions with the companies targeted by them.
We support Ukraine's right of self-defense and reiterate our commitment to Ukraine's long-term security, including by implementing bilateral security commitments and arrangements based on the Joint Declaration endorsed in Vilnius last July. We are increasing our production and delivery capabilities to assist its self-defense. We also support efforts to assist Ukraine modernizing its armed forces and strengthening its own defense industry. We express our resolve to bolster Ukraine's air defense capabilities to save lives and protect critical infrastructure.
We are committed to raising the costs of Russia's war by building on the comprehensive package of sanctions and economic measures already in place. Though our measures have had a significant impact on Russia's ability to build its war machine and to fund its invasion, its military is still posing a threat not just to Ukraine but also to international security.
We will continue taking measures against actors in China and third countries that materially support Russia's war machine, including financial institutions, consistent with our legal systems, and other entities in China that facilitate Russia's acquisition of items for its defense industrial base.
In this context, we reiterate that entities, including financial institutions, that facilitate Russia's acquisition of items or equipment for its defense industrial base are supporting actions that undermine the territorial integrity, sovereignty, and independence of Ukraine. Accordingly, we will impose restrictive measures consistent with our legal systems to prevent abuse and restrict access to our financial systems for targeted individuals and entities in third countries, including Chinese entities, that engage in this activity. We will take robust action against actors who aid Russia in circumventing our sanctions, including by imposing severe costs on all those who fail to immediately cease providing material support to Russia's aggression and by strengthening domestic enforcement and stepping up our business engagement to promote corporate responsibility. We call on financial institutions to refrain from supporting and profiting from Russia's war machine. We will take further steps to deter and disrupt this behaviour.
We will continue to apply significant pressure on Russian revenues from energy and other commodities. This will include improving the efficacy of the oil price cap policy by taking further steps to tighten compliance and enforcement, while working to maintain market stability. We will take steps, including sanctions and innovative enforcement activities leveraging respective geographies, to combat Russia's use of deceptive alternative shipping practices to circumvent our sanctions by way of its shadow fleet. We call on industry actors facilitating this activity to consider the financial liability and environmental and reputational damage risks associated with these practices. We will impose additional sanctions measures on those engaged in deceptive practices while transporting Russian oil and against the networks Russia has developed to extract additional revenue from price cap violations or from oil sales using alternative service providers. We will continue taking further steps to limit Russia's future energy revenues by impeding development of future energy projects and disrupting access to the goods and services on which those projects rely. We will continue our efforts to reduce Russia's revenues from metals.
Ukraine's reconstruction remains a key priority, including early recovery measures and addressing the current energy emergency caused by Russia's increased targeting of Ukraine's energy infrastructure. We re-emphasize our strong support for Ukraine's energy security, including by coordinating international assistance through the G7+ Ukraine Energy Coordination Group. We will continue to work with the Ukrainian authorities and International Financial Institutions through the Multi-agency Donor Coordination Platform, and by mobilizing private investments and fostering participation of civil society.
We highlight the reality of 3.4 million internally displaced Ukrainians and the importance of inclusive recovery and the need to address the needs of women, children and persons with disabilities as well as other population groups who have been disproportionately affected by Russia's war of aggression. The reintegration of combatants and civilians with disabilities in society remains a priority. We call on Russia to release all persons it has unlawfully detained and to safely return all civilians it has illegally transferred or deported, starting with children.
We reiterate our support for Ukraine's agriculture sector, which is critical for global food supply, particularly for the most vulnerable nations. We therefore call for unimpeded deliveries of grain, foodstuffs, fertilizers and inputs from Ukraine across the Black Sea and recall the importance of the EU Solidarity Lanes and President Zelenskyy's Grain from Ukraine initiative.
We are also working to involve our private sectors in the sustainable economic recovery of Ukraine. We welcome and underscore the significance of Ukraine itself continuing to implement domestic reform efforts, especially in the fields of anti-corruption, justice system reform, decentralization, and promotion of the rule of law. We will continue to support efforts of the Ukrainian government and people in these endeavors. We will build on the Japan-Ukraine Conference for Promotion of Economic Growth and Reconstruction held in Tokyo on 19 February and the Ukraine Recovery Conference held on 11-12 June in Berlin and we look forward to the next Ukraine Recovery Conference in Rome in 2025.
We welcome the Summit on Peace in Ukraine planned in Switzerland on 15-16 June to build a framework for peace based on international law, the UN Charter and its principles, with respect for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. We will continue to work to achieve the widest possible international support for the key principles and objectives of President Zelenskyy's Peace Formula.
Our ultimate goal remains a just, lasting and comprehensive peace in line with international law and the UN Charter and its principles and respect for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. We will continue to stand by Ukraine for as long as it takes.
Conflict in Gaza 
We reiterate our strongest condemnation of the brutal terrorist attacks conducted by Hamas and other terrorist groups against Israel on 7 October 2023. We express our full solidarity and support to Israel and its people and reaffirm our unwavering commitment towards its security. In exercising its right to defend itself, Israel must fully comply with its obligations under international law in all circumstances, including international humanitarian law. We condemn Hamas for its continuing use of civilian infrastructure for its military activities and failure to separate and distinguish itself from civilians in Gaza. We deplore all losses of civilian lives equally, and note with great concern the unacceptable number of civilian casualties especially women and children. We call on all parties to take every feasible step to protect civilian lives.
We fully endorse and will stand behind the comprehensive deal outlined by President Biden that would lead to an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, the release of all hostages, a significant and sustained increase in the flow of humanitarian assistance throughout Gaza, and an enduring end to the crisis, with Israel's security interests and safety for Palestinian civilians in Gaza assured. In this regard, we welcome UNSC Resolution S/RES/2735 (2024). We reiterate our call on Hamas to fully and unequivocally accept and implement the cease fire proposal, as outlined in Resolution 2735, and urge countries with influence over Hamas to help ensure that it does so. We welcome Israel's acceptance of the proposal and readiness to move forward with it.
We urge all parties to facilitate rapid and unimpeded passage of humanitarian relief for civilians in need, in particular women and children. Securing full, rapid, safe, and unhindered humanitarian access in all its forms, consistent with international humanitarian law, and through all relevant land crossing points, including the Rafah crossing, through maritime delivery routes, including through Ashdod Port, and throughout all of Gaza remains an absolute priority. We agree it is critical that UNRWA and other UN organizations and agencies' distribution networks be fully able to deliver aid to those who need it most, fulfilling their mandate effectively.
We are deeply concerned by the consequences on the civilian population of the ongoing ground operations in Rafah, and the possibility of a full-scale military offensive that would have further dire consequences for civilians. We call on the Government of Israel to refrain from such an offensive.
We welcome the appointment of the new Palestinian Authority cabinet and remain ready to support the Palestinian Authority as it undertakes the reforms that are indispensable to enable it to discharge its responsibilities in the West Bank and, in the aftermath of the conflict, in Gaza. Actions that weaken the Palestinian Authority must stop, including the withholding of clearance revenues by the Israeli Government. Maintaining economic stability in the West Bank is critical for regional security. We call on Israel to take the necessary measures to ensure that correspondent banking services between Israeli and Palestinian banks remain in place, so that vital financial transactions and critical trade in services continue; to release withheld clearance revenues to the Palestinian authority, in view of its urgent fiscal needs; and to remove or relax other measures to avoid further exacerbating the economic situation in the West Bank.
We reiterate our unwavering commitment to the vision of the two-state solution where two democratic States, Israel and Palestine, live side by side in peace within secure and recognized borders, consistent with international law and relevant UN resolutions, and in this regard stress the importance of unifying the Gaza strip with the West Bank under the Palestinian Authority. We note that mutual recognition, to include the recognition of a Palestinian state, at the appropriate time, would be a crucial component of that political process.
We affirm our commitment to working together—and with other international partners—to closely coordinate and institutionalize our support for civil society peacebuilding efforts, ensuring that they are part of a larger strategy to build the foundation necessary for a negotiated and lasting Israeli-Palestinian peace.
All parties must refrain from any unilateral actions that undermine the prospect of a two-state solution, including Israeli expansion of settlements and the ""legalization"" of settlement outposts. We condemn the rise in extremist settler violence committed against Palestinians, which undermines security and stability in the West Bank, and threatens prospects for a lasting peace. We encourage support for the Palestinian Authority Security Services to make sure the West Bank remains stable and conducive to the ultimate establishment of a Palestinian state.
We are deeply engaged—along with partners in the region—in preventing the conflict from escalating further. We reiterate our firm condemnation of Iran's attack against Israel of 13-14 April, which marked an unacceptable escalation, and we reaffirm our commitment towards Israel security. We call on all parties to lower tensions and contribute in a constructive way to de-escalation.
We are particularly concerned by the situation along the Blue Line. We recognize the essential stabilizing role played by the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) and the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) in mitigating that risk. We urge all involved actors to exercise restraint to avoid further escalation, consistent with UNSCR 1701.
Freedom of Navigation in the Red Sea 
We condemn the ongoing attacks perpetrated by the Houthis against international and commercial vessels transiting through the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. These illegal attacks must end. We call for the immediate release by the Houthis of the Galaxy Leader and its crew. We reiterate the right of countries to defend their vessels, in line with UNSCR 2722 and in accordance with international law.
The EU maritime operation ""Aspides"" and the U.S.-led operation ""Prosperity Guardian"" play an essential role to protect crucial shipping lanes that are fundamental for global trade. Maritime security and navigational rights and freedoms are critical to ensuring free movement of essential commodities to destinations and populations all over the world. This includes delivery of life-saving humanitarian assistance to more than half the population of Yemen.
The continuing Houthi attacks in the Red Sea risk destabilizing the region, stopping freedom of navigation and trade flows and endangering the UN-led roadmap towards peace in Yemen. We call on the Houthis to comply with their obligations under international humanitarian law and cease their attacks in the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden and surrounding waters. We further call on Yemeni parties to continue their positive efforts in furtherance of the understanding reached in December 2023, under UN auspices, regarding the peace process.
Iran
Iran must cease its destabilizing actions.
We reiterate our determination that it must never develop or acquire a nuclear weapon. We urge Tehran to cease and reverse nuclear escalations, and stop the continuing uranium enrichment activities that have no credible civilian justifications. Iran must engage in serious dialogue and provide convincing assurances that its nuclear program is exclusively peaceful, in full cooperation and compliance with the IAEA's monitoring and verification mechanism, including the Board of Governors' resolution of 5 June. We support IAEA's monitoring and verification role regarding Iran's nuclear-related obligation and commitments and express strong concern about Iran's current lack of cooperation with the Agency.
We call on Iran to stop assisting Russia's war in Ukraine and not to transfer ballistic missiles and related technology, as this would represent a substantive material escalation and a direct threat to European security. We are prepared to respond in a swift and coordinated manner, including with new and significant measures.
We demand that Iran cease its malicious activities and destabilizing actions in the Middle East and we stand ready to adopt further sanctions or take other measures in response to further destabilizing initiatives. We continue to call for the immediate release of the MSC Aries, its remaining crew and cargo.
We reiterate our deep concern over Iran's human rights violations, especially against women, girls and minority groups. We call on Iran's leadership to end all unjust and arbitrary detentions, including of dual and foreign citizens, and condemn the unacceptable harassment of its citizens.
Fostering partnerships with African countries 
We are committed to stepping up our support to African countries in their efforts to achieve sustainable development and local value creation, strengthen democratic governance, contribute to global stability and prosperity, and protect the rule-based international order. In doing so, we remain focused on equitable partnerships rooted in shared principles, democratic values, local ownership, and concrete initiatives. We will align our efforts with the African Union Agenda 2063 and African countries' needs and priorities, including the integrated African continental plans for improved local and regional food security, infrastructure, trade and agricultural productivity. We will also support the operationalization of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCTA) which will be an essential parameter of African growth in the coming decade.
We will reinforce mutually beneficial and equitable cooperation with African countries and regional organizations. While assuring African countries our continued financial support, we will enhance the coordination and effectiveness of G7 cooperation resources; support better mobilization and management of local domestic resources; and promote increased private investment. We endorse African countries' call for greater voice in international bodies and welcome the AU's participation in the G20 as a permanent member, and the creation of a third Chair for sub-Saharan Africa at the IMF Executive Board in November. We reiterate our support for the G20 Compact with Africa, as a tool to increase private sector investments, promote structural reforms, and local entrepreneurship support, and enhance cooperation, including in the energy sector. The G7 Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) including initiatives such as the EU Global Gateway offer a framework, we will use to promote our vision of sustainable, resilient, and economically viable infrastructure in Africa, underpinned by transparent project selection, procurement, and finance. In that respect, we welcome the Mattei Plan for Africa launched by Italy.
Acknowledging that sustainable development and democracy are mutually reinforcing, we reiterate our commitment to supporting African governments in advancing democratic governance and human rights, as we address conditions conducive to terrorism, violent extremism, and instability. In this respect, we are concerned about the activities of the Kremlin-backed Wagner Group's and other emerging Russia-backed forces, which are having a destabilizing impact. We call for accountability of all those responsible for human rights violations and abuses.
Countries should not be forced to choose between fighting against poverty and protecting the planet or addressing global challenges, nor between repaying creditors and making further investments in development. We are committed to evolve the international financial architecture to make it fit for the challenges of today's world. We support the ambition of partnerships such as the G20 Compact with Africa and the Paris Pact for People and Planet (4P), which work to foster collaboration between key global stakeholders to deliver additional financing for development, climate, and nature and fostering private sector investment. As outlined in the Nairobi-Washington Vision, we call on the international community to step up sustainable and transparent financing for developing countries willing to commit to ambitious reforms and investment plans, while emphasizing the importance of domestic resource mobilization. This includes working with other stakeholders to deliver coordinated international financial institution support packages, utilize tools to facilitate private finance on better terms and unlock private investments, and activate creditor coordination and private sector participation when needed so as to ensure multilateral support is being used in the best interest of developing countries. We will work with the IMF, the World Bank, and other key parties to bring this plan forward, with a view to realize it for pilot countries by the end of 2024.
Sustainable Development, Food Security and PGII 
We reaffirm our steadfast commitment towards the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and we will redouble our efforts to accelerate progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), restated at the 2023 SDG Summit, to ensure nobody is left behind. With our partners, we will work on concrete and ambitious actions to achieve long-term sustainable development, strong, environmental social and governance standards, and shared prosperity worldwide.
Noting that we have already exceeded our joint commitment of USD 14 billion to global food security, announced in Elmau in 2022, we remain steadfast in addressing the escalating global food security and nutrition crisis, aggravated by Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine.
We are launching the G7 Apulia Food Systems Initiative (AFSI) to intensify our efforts to overcome structural barriers to food security and nutrition and to build resilient sustainable and productive agriculture and food systems, and to ensure that all people can progressively realize the right to adequate food. This includes enhancing sustainability and productivity of local, regional, and global supply chains and addressing discriminatory rules and norms that affect gender equality. This initiative will leverage multi-stakeholder partnerships to advance ambitious programs on the ground and harness the full potential of food systems.
Noting global food supply disruptions due to climate change and that the Paris Agreement can only be reached by transforming food systems, we will support synergetic and coherent policies and investments to address the climate-food systems nexus, particularly in low-income countries. We will contribute to these efforts globally, with a special attention to implementing and aligning with the African continental plans by supporting the following multi-stakeholder programs developed with the African Union and other global partners: i) the Technical Cooperation Collaborative to implement the ""COP28 UAE Declaration on sustainable agriculture, resilient food systems, and climate action"" and enhance access to quality technical cooperation for the integration of food systems and climate plans in low-income and climate vulnerable countries; ii) the Vision for Adapted Crops and Soils for the restoration and maintenance of healthy soils and the further development and climate resilience of traditional and indigenous crops in Africa, recalling the importance of Africa Fertilizer and Soil Health Summit 2024; iii) a G7 private-public initiative on coffee aimed to further advance policy, sustained investments, research and innovation, partnerships, blended finance to boost the resilience, environmental sustainability, value addition and circularity of the coffee value chains worldwide and to support smallholders and family farmers in producing countries, including examining the feasibility of the establishment of a global private-public fund on coffee.
Given childhood stunting and wasting caused by malnutrition can have lifelong physical, psychological, and social effects that threaten sustainable development, we commit to support treatment and prevention to address this challenge. We will foster multi-stakeholder engagement and innovation, including with multilaterals, the private sector and philanthropies, and welcome in particular the 2025 Paris Nutrition for Growth Summit.
We will also promote innovative solutions to increase the quantity and quality of public and private funding for food security and food systems in low-income countries. We will: i) work together to improve the fiscal space for food security in line with continued efforts to improve the international financial architecture, including further analysis of the potential of debt swaps, ii) building on existing cooperation, initiate a collaborative of G7 public development banks and DFIs to enhance co-investment and risk-mitigation for sustainable agriculture and food systems transformation; iii) support the design and development of a Financing for Shock-Driven Food Crisis Facility to provide rapid-response financing in anticipation of severe food crises, also involving private capital from global insurance markets.
Accordingly, we task our Development Ministers to further articulate the AFSI commitments and actions, ahead of their Meeting in October, in synergy with Ministers of Finance, Agriculture and Environment noting in particular the Initiative on Strengthening Seed Certification Capacity in Africa and the Africampus program to bridge educational gaps for African farmers and entrepreneurs, under joint development by the Ministers of Agriculture and international partners.
We also highlight synergies between AFSI, the Global Alliance for Food Security, and the Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty under development within the G20, which the ambitions of we fully support.
We also continue to support coordinated action with and among the UN Rome Based Agencies and the wider UN system, Multilateral Development Banks and other relevant organizations, including the African Union.
With a view to addressing global food insecurity and malnutrition, we also acknowledge the importance of supporting fertilizer value chains including local fertilizer production in line with WTO rules and through supporting the use of local sources of energy in consistency with a 1.5°C warming limit and the goals of the Paris Agreement.
We reaffirm our commitment to mobilize up to USD 600 billion through the PGII by 2027 towards sustainable, inclusive, resilient, and quality infrastructure and investments with partner countries, with a particular focus on Africa and on the Indo-Pacific. We reaffirm the Carbis Bay commitment for our DFIs and multilateral partners to invest at least USD 80 billion into the private sector in Africa, and we recognize the importance of directing more investment to poorer and more fragile countries across the continent.
We will enhance this Partnership by: i) raising the profile of the PGII initiative throughout the G7 platform with the strong coordination and involvement of all its G7 tracks and establishing a secretariat for effective implementation and investment coordination with partners; ii) supporting the launch of the African Virtual Investment Platform, in collaboration with the African Union and OECD, to enhance information sharing, transparency, and public policies on investment in Africa; iii) working together with our DFIs, MDBs, and private sector to improve green investments in Africa as part of our PGII commitment. In this respect, we will progressively enhance country-based investment coordination, including through platforms such as the Alliance for Green Infrastructure in Africa.
We commit to implement these key pillars, as we are stepping up our efforts to attract private investments at scale, improving the enabling environments, maximizing the role of MDBs and DFIs, enhancing co-financing, advancing high standards for quality infrastructure, including through certification schemes such as the Blue Dot Network and the FAST-INFRA Initiative and further developing a pipeline of bankable projects. We also call on all actors to adhere to international rules, standards, and principles, including the G20 Principles for Quality Infrastructure Investments.
We will further promote concrete G7 PGII initiatives, flagship projects, and complementary initiatives to develop transformative economic corridors for quality infrastructure and investment, such as the deepening of our coordination and financing for the Lobito Corridor, the Luzon Corridor, the Middle Corridor, and the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor, also building on the EU Global Gateway, the Great Green Wall Initiative, and the Mattei Plan for Africa launched by Italy.
Indo-Pacific 
We reiterate our commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific, based on the rule of law, which is inclusive, prosperous, and secure, grounded on sovereignty, territorial integrity, peaceful resolution of disputes, fundamental freedoms, and human rights. Peace and stability in the region are key to promoting global prosperity, and developments there can directly affect global security. We reaffirm our unwavering support for ASEAN centrality and unity and our commitment to promoting cooperation in line with the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific. We also affirm our intention to work to support Pacific Island Countries' priorities as articulated through the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent.
We seek constructive and stable relations with China and recognize the importance of direct and candid engagement to express concerns and manage differences. We act in our national interest. Given China's role in the international community, cooperation is necessary to address global challenges, and we continue to engage in areas of common interest. We call on China to step up efforts to promote international peace and security, and to work with us to tackle the climate, biodiversity, and pollution crises, combat illicit synthetic drug trafficking, ensure global macroeconomic stability, support global health security, and address vulnerable countries' debt sustainability and financing needs.
We recognize the importance of China in global trade. We are committed to advancing free and fair trade, a level playing field, and balanced economic relations, while updating and strengthening the multilateral rule-based trading system with the WTO at its core. We are not trying to harm China or thwart its economic development, indeed a growing China that plays by international rules and norms would be of global interest. However, we express our concerns about China's persistent industrial targeting and comprehensive non-market policies and practices that are leading to global spillovers, market distortions and harmful overcapacity in a growing range of sectors, undermining our workers, industries, and economic resilience and security. We are not decoupling or turning inwards. We are de-risking and diversifying supply chains where necessary and appropriate, and fostering resilience to economic coercion. We further call on China to refrain from adopting export control measures, particularly on critical minerals, that could lead to significant global supply chain disruptions.
With these concerns in mind, together with partners, we will invest in building our and their respective industrial capacities, promote diversified and resilient supply chains, and reduce critical dependencies and vulnerabilities. We will strengthen diplomatic efforts and international cooperation, including in the WTO, to encourage fair practices and build resilience to economic coercion. We will continue to take actions, as necessary and appropriate, to protect our workers and businesses from unfair practices, to level the playing field and remedy ongoing harm.
We call on China to uphold its commitment to act responsibly in cyberspace. We will continue our efforts to disrupt and deter persistent, malicious cyber activity stemming from China, which threatens our citizens' safety and privacy, undermines innovation, and puts our critical infrastructure at risk. We recognize the necessity of protecting certain advanced technologies that can be used to threaten our national security, without unduly limiting trade and investment.
We reaffirm that maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait is indispensable to international security and prosperity. We support Taiwan's meaningful participation in international organizations, including in the World Health Assembly and WHO technical meetings, as a member where statehood is not a prerequisite and as an observer or guest where it is. There is no change in the basic positions of the G7 members on Taiwan, including stated one China policies. We call for a peaceful resolution of cross-Strait issues.
We remain seriously concerned about the situation in the East and South China Seas and reiterate our strong opposition to any unilateral attempt to change the status quo by force or coercion. We continue opposing China's dangerous use of coast guard and maritime militia in the South China Sea and its repeated obstruction of countries' high seas freedom of navigation. We express serious concern about the increasing use of dangerous maneuvers and water cannons against Philippine vessels. In this regard, we reaffirm that there is no legal basis for China's expansive maritime claims in the South China Sea, and we oppose China's militarization, and coercive and intimidation activities in the South China Sea. We re-emphasize the universal and unified character of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and reaffirm UNCLOS's important role in setting out the legal framework that governs all activities in the oceans and the seas. We reiterate that the award rendered by the Arbitral Tribunal on 12 July 2016 is a significant milestone, which is legally binding upon the parties to those proceedings, and a useful basis for peacefully resolving disputes between the parties.
We express our deep concern at the People's Republic of China's support to Russia. We call on China to press Russia to stop its military aggression and immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw its troops from Ukraine. We encourage China to support a comprehensive, just and lasting peace based on territorial integrity and the principles and purposes of the UN Charter, including through its direct dialogue with Ukraine. China's ongoing support for Russia's defense industrial base is enabling Russia to maintain its illegal war in Ukraine and has significant and broad-based security implications. We call on China to cease the transfer of dual-use materials, including weapons components and equipment, that are inputs for Russia's defense sector.
We remain concerned by the human rights situation in China, including in Tibet and in Xinjiang where forced labor is a major concern to us. We are also worried by China's crackdown on Hong Kong's autonomy, independent institutions, and civil society and continued erosion of rights and freedom, including through the recent enactment of legislation under Article 23 of the Basic Law that has broad and vaguely defined provisions regarding ""sedition"", ""state secrets,"" and interactions with foreign entities. We express concerns about the use of such laws to silence dissent in Hong Kong and overseas, including politically motivated prosecutions. These developments will make it harder to live, work and do business in Hong Kong.
We call on China not to conduct or condone activities aimed at undermining the security and safety of our communities and the integrity of our democratic institutions, and to act in strict accordance with its obligations under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations.
We reiterate our call for the complete, verifiable, and irreversible dismantlement of all North Korea's weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles. We urge all UN Member States to fully implement all relevant UN Security Council resolutions (UNSCRs) and reiterate our deep disappointment with Russia's veto in March on the UNSCR 1718 Committee Panel of Experts mandate renewal. We strongly condemn North Korea's continued development of its ballistic missile program in defiance of multiple UNSCRs, including through launches of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) and space launch vehicles using ballistic missile technologies. We condemn in the strongest possible terms the increasing military cooperation between North Korea and Russia, including North Korea's export and Russia's procurement of North Korean ballistic missiles in direct violation of relevant UNSCRs, as well as Russia's use of these missiles against Ukraine. We are also deeply concerned about the potential for any transfer of nuclear or ballistic missiles-related technology to North Korea, in violation of the relevant UNSCRs. We urge Russia and North Korea to immediately cease all such activities and abide by relevant UNSCRs. We reiterate our commitment to counter sanctions evasion and strengthen enforcement of all North Korea related UNSCRs. We call on North Korea to accept repeated offers of dialogue, to enhance regional peace and security. We strongly condemn North Korea's choice to prioritize its unlawful WMD and ballistic missile programs over the welfare of the people in North Korea and we demand that it abandons these programs. We urge North Korea to respect human rights, facilitate access for international humanitarian organizations, and resolve the abductions issue immediately.
We reiterate our firm condemnation of the brutal repression of the people of Myanmar by the Myanmar military regime, and express our concern with the expanding humanitarian crisis across the country.
We deplore the implementation of the 2010 People's Military Service Law. This is causing further internal and regional displacement, risks exacerbating divides and hampering reconciliation. Accountability for serious crimes committed in the whole country remains essential. We are particularly concerned that sectarian tensions could inflame Rakhine again, hindering the creation of conditions for voluntary, safe, dignified and sustainable return of Rohingya refugees and all displaced persons, while propelling regional instability.
We reiterate our demands for unimpeded humanitarian access to those in need, that all parties respect human rights and international humanitarian law, and for the release of those arbitrarily detained. We reaffirm that an inclusive dialogue with all stakeholders is essential to restore foundations for a durable democratic process.
We also reiterate the importance of UNSCR 2669 and continue to support the UN's further engagement in the crisis and ASEAN's efforts to achieve the implementation of the Five-Point Consensus.
We restate our appeal on all States to prevent or to halt the flow of arms and dual-use material, including jet fuel, to the Myanmar military, and to contribute to the search for a viable political solution which respects the democratic aspirations of Myanmar's people.
Regional issues 
HAITI
We commit to work together with other members of the international community for the stabilization of Haiti and to ensure robust and timely funding and other support for the Kenya-led Multinational Security Support (MSS) mission, which needs to be deployed as soon as possible, and to support the Haitian National Police (HNP). We welcome Kenya's leadership of the MSS mission. It is imperative that violence by criminal gangs is stopped. We welcome the establishment of the Presidential Transitional Council (CPT) as well as the appointment of interim Prime Minister Garry Conille and look forward to the rapid establishment of a transitional Government as the outcome of a transparent and inclusive national process. It is necessary to address urgently the most immediate needs of the population, protect women and children, restore security and the rule of law and start shaping the institutional framework required to lead Haiti to free and democratic elections by February 2026. We will continue to follow closely developments in Haiti. To that end, we welcome the efforts of the newly established G7 Working Group on Haiti to advance the MSS mission, the country's stabilization, including through humanitarian assistance and long-term development, accountability mechanisms, and democratic governance in Haiti.
LIBYA
We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to Libya's stability, independence, territorial integrity and national unity, including in the face of external interference. We call on all Libyan institutional stakeholders to overcome the current political stalemate by engaging in meaningful dialogue in good faith and without preconditions. An inclusive, Libyan-led, Libyan-owned political process facilitated by the United Nations remains the only viable pathway towards free and fair national presidential and parliamentary elections. In this context, we call on the Secretary General of the United Nations to appoint a new Special Representative without delay, and affirm our full support to the United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL)'s interim leadership.
SAHEL
We remain concerned for the deterioration of the security situation in the Sahel, including the spread of terrorism and violent conflict causing widespread misery and displacement of the civilian population. This is compounded by the backsliding of the principles of constitutional rule of law, democracy and good governance and regression in the regional cooperation frameworks.
The grave human rights violations committed by multiple parties, including Russian proxies and local security forces in the region are unacceptable.
The challenge of growing political tension, confrontation, and instability in the Sahel requires renewed efforts by all relevant actors and stakeholders in reconfiguring international and regional responses.
A continued support to the civilian populations in the Sahel is essential to alleviate their suffering.
We call upon the States of the Sahel to accelerate the pace of the transition for return to constitutional order, and stand ready to assist them. We look forward to enhancing cooperation with the African Union and its current Mauritanian Presidency as well as regional organizations and the UN in fostering stability, security, good governance and development in the Sahel, preventing the ""spill-over"" of insecurity towards the Gulf of Guinea and North Africa, as well as irregular migratory flows.
SUDAN
We strongly condemn the ongoing fighting in Sudan, including human rights violations and abuses as well as international humanitarian law violations since April 2023. The situation is constantly deteriorating with increased civilian casualties. We express particular concern for the risks posed to women and children by both parties to the conflict and the increase in ethnic-based violence which must cease immediately. This is further undermining the fragile humanitarian situation and creating further displacement risks.
All parties must allow and facilitate rapid and unimpeded passage of humanitarian relief. We reiterate our call on all parties to immediately cease hostilities throughout the country, to enter into serious, direct negotiations, to agree and implement an immediate and lasting ceasefire without pre-conditions. We are deeply concerned by the current escalation in El-Fasher in North Darfur.
We urge external actors to refrain from fueling the conflict, and we encourage all Sudanese actors to engage in a national dialogue inclusive of the composite Sudanese civil society and aimed at re-establishing civilian and representative institutions to meet the democratic aspirations of the Sudanese people.
An active African and regional role, as well as the intensified and coordinated efforts of the international community, remain essential to ending violence and restoring democracy.
We welcome the outcomes of the Paris Conference for Sudan and the neighboring countries, where over EUR 2 billion have been pledged to support the civilian population in Sudan, and those who sought refuge in neighboring countries.
VENEZUELA
We are deeply concerned by the ongoing political, economic, and humanitarian crisis in Venezuela and by the lack of progress on the implementation of the Barbados Agreement of October 2023, with regard to the rights of the opposition within the electoral process and the decision to withdraw the invitation for an EU election observation mission. We call on Venezuela to fully implement the Barbados Agreement and to ensure competitive and inclusive elections on 28 July, that encompass full and credible international electoral observation missions. We further demand an end to the harassment of opposition members, and for the release of all political prisoners immediately.
We are following closely developments between Venezuela and Guyana over the Essequibo region and welcome regional efforts to maintain dialogues between the parties. We demand that Venezuela refrain from further destabilizing initiatives. The matter must be resolved peacefully, in line with international law.
BELARUS
We reiterate our condemnation of the Belarusian regime's complicity in Russia's war against Ukraine. We express our continued concern over the regime's continuing repression of independent media, civil society, opposition, and citizens that peacefully express their views. We also condemn the ill treatment of political prisoners and ask for their immediate and unconditional release.
Sustainable Urban Development 
We emphasize the transformative power of cities worldwide as drivers for sustainable development. We will continue our cooperation on sustainable urban development and task our relevant Ministers to discuss concrete actions to reduce spatial inequalities, protect the environment and climate, and promote smart and innovative economies in urban areas.
Energy, Climate and Environment 
We reiterate our determination to address the triple global crisis of climate change, pollution, and biodiversity loss. We remain steadfast in our commitment to the Paris Agreement and keeping a limit of 1.5°C global temperature rise within reach and note with deep concern the findings of the first Global Stocktake at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP28) that there is a significant gap between global current emissions trajectories and this commitment. Our goal remains unchanged, to provide a substantial contribution to efforts to reduce global GHG emissions by around 43 per cent in this critical decade and by 60 per cent by 2035, relative to the 2019 level. We underline that this is a collective effort and further actions from all countries, especially major economies, are required in order to peak global GHG by 2025 at the latest and achieve net-zero by 2050.
We commit to submitting ambitious 1.5°C aligned NDCs, which will be catalysts for investments, with economy-wide, absolute reduction targets, covering all GHGs, sectors and categories. Underlining that this is a collective effort, we call on all countries, especially G20 and other major economies, to do the same. We will advance global and regional efforts to secure affordable clean energy for all, recognizing different national pathways.
We welcome the commitments, as set forth in COP28, to triple global renewable capacity and double the global average annual rate of energy efficiency improvements by 2030. Energy efficiency is the first fuel and an essential element of clean energy transition. We also commit to meet the global goal of deploying 1500 GW of energy storage in the power sector by 2030, including through existing targets and policies. We will transition away from fossil fuels in energy systems in a just, orderly, and equitable manner, accelerating actions in this critical decade, to achieve net-zero by 2050 in keeping with the best available science. We will operationalize these commitments through the development and implementation of domestic plans, policies and actions, including to inform and be reflected in our NDCs and LTSs, and through intensive efforts to reduce demand for and use of fossil fuels. We reaffirm our commitment to eliminate inefficient fossil fuel subsidies by 2025 or sooner and will report in 2025 on progress made. We call on others to do the same.
We reaffirm the important role of high integrity carbon markets and carbon pricing, to foster cost-efficient reductions in emission levels, drive innovation and enable a transformation to net-zero and will work together and with others to accelerate their ambitious use.
To achieve our climate goals and help all countries reap the benefits of the clean energy transition, we will work with partners to end support for new unabated coal power, accelerate investments in renewable and clean energy sources, and establish secure, diverse, responsible clean energy supply chains. We reaffirm our commitment to achieve a fully or predominantly decarbonized power sector by 2035 and to phase out existing unabated coal power generation in our energy systems during the first half of 2030s, or in a timeline consistent with keeping a limit of 1.5°C temperature rise within reach, in line with countries' net-zero pathways. We reiterate our call for other countries and partners to join us in ending permitting and construction of new unabated coal-fired powerplants as soon as possible, and will promote cooperation with countries, international partners, and relevant organizations, including the financial sector, to this end, noting the work of those joining the Powering Past Coal Alliance and the Coal Transition Accelerator, to facilitate these goals.
We commit to accelerating the transition toward decarbonization in the industrial sectors and particularly in the hard-to-abate sectors. We will promote and facilitate the scale-up of investments in the industrial sector for innovative technologies, smart clean electrification, improved energy efficiency, direct use of renewable heat, sustainable bio energies, sustainable production of energy from waste, sustainable biogases and biofuels, renewable, clean/zero-emission and low-carbon hydrogen and its derivatives such as ammonia and direct use of renewable energy close to demand centers, the use of carbon management technologies. We also commit to accelerate the reduction of emissions from transport. We will continue working on this, including through the G7 Industrial Decarbonization Agenda as well as the Climate Club and its ambitious work program.
We reaffirm that the transition to a net-zero economy by 2050 at the latest should be inclusive and leave no one behind, and should be an opportunity for enhancing social development and economic growth, maximizing positive benefits for local economies while addressing negative social or economic impacts that may arise from climate action. Recognizing that cutting methane emissions from fossil fuel operations by means of already existing technologies is largely feasible and cost-effective for oil and gas operations, we will intensify efforts to tackle methane emissions in line with the global reduction level of at least 35 percent in methane emissions by 2035. We commit to pursue a collective effort towards a 75 per cent reduction in global methane emissions from fossil fuels, including by reducing the methane emissions intensity of oil and gas operations by 2030, through developing a robust methodology and use of measure data, and work with non-G7 oil and gas producing countries particularly in Africa, to deliver deep cuts to methane emissions.
Reaffirming our commitments in the 2023 Hiroshima Leaders' Statement, we note that G7 countries have made significant progress in reducing dependency on Russian fossil fuels, including through energy savings and gas demand reduction in a manner consistent with our Paris Commitments and address the global impact of Russia's war on energy supplies, gas prices and inflation, and people's lives, recognizing the primary need to accelerate the clean energy transition. We recognize that restricting Russian energy revenues is an essential part of our support to Ukraine and are pursuing to end significant dependency on, and to work on transitioning away from imports of Russian gas as soon as possible. In this context, we stress the important role that increased deliveries of LNG can play and acknowledge that investment in the sector can be appropriate in response to the current crisis and to address potential gas market shortfalls provoked by the crisis. In the exceptional circumstance of accelerating the phase-out of our dependency on Russian energy, publicly supported investments in the gas sector can be appropriate as a temporary response, subject to clearly defined national circumstances, if implemented in a manner consistent with our climate objectives without creating lock-in effects, for example by ensuring that projects are integrated into national strategies for the development of low-carbon and renewable hydrogen.
Those G7 countries that opt to use nuclear energy or support its use recognize its potential as a clean/zero-emissions energy source and reiterate its potential in accelerating the transition to net-zero and improving global energy security. They will continue supporting cooperative efforts to responsibly strengthen nuclear supply chains' safety, reliability and resilience while also promoting responsible waste management. We support Japan's safe, transparent, and science-based process to responsibly manage the discharge of Advanced Liquid Processing System treated water and in proactively coordinating with scientists and partners as well as the IAEA. They will also promote research and development in innovative technologies for advanced and small modular reactors, including microreactors, work collectively to enable greater access to project financing tools, and support sectorial collaboration. They note the global Declaration to Triple Global Nuclear Energy Capacity by 2050, launched during COP28. We will further reduce reliance on civil nuclear and related goods from Russia, including working to assist countries seeking to diversify their supplies. We underline that the highest standards of nuclear safety and security are important to all countries and their respective publics.
Fusion energy technology has the potential to provide a lasting solution to the global challenges of climate change and energy security. We will promote international collaborations to accelerate the development and demonstration of fusion plants to foster private investments and public engagement. With this aim, we commit to establishing a G7 Working Group on Fusion Energy. We will also work towards consistent approaches to fusion regulations. To enhance cooperation in this field, we welcome Italy and the International Atomic Energy Agency's decision to host in Rome the inaugural ministerial meeting of the World Fusion Energy Group.
We recall our commitment to holistically addressing energy security, climate crisis and geopolitical risk. In this context, we strongly encourage international partnerships to make critical minerals and critical raw materials supply chains more diversified, transparent, resilient, responsible, circular, resource efficient, and sustainable. We will support local value creation in critical minerals supply chains in line with WTO rules. We are working to advance strong international environmental, social, and governance standards for critical minerals extraction, processing, and recycling while leveraging their economic and development opportunities, particularly in low-income countries, including through implementation of the Five-Point Plan for Critical Mineral Security, as well as driving work through the International Energy Agency, the Mineral Security Partnership, and the RISE Partnership and the Sustainable Critical Mineral Alliance.
We will work to accelerate investment in clean energy and build out the secure, responsible, and diverse supply chains necessary to achieve these goals, together with partners around the world.
We are determined to ensure affordable, reliable, sustainable, clean, and modern energy in developing countries, particularly in Africa, recognizing the opportunity that the clean energy transition presents to spur a new era of productivity, industrial growth, and economic development, and to advance the priority of clean cooking in the continent. We stand ready to play a pivotal role in supporting Africa's ambitions and efforts to develop adequate clean energy infrastructure and supply chains. For this reason, we are launching the Energy for Growth in Africa initiative, alongside Côte d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria, Republic of Congo, and South Africa, and we look forward to others joining. This initiative will drive clean energy investments across the continent with strong African countries' ownership, contributing to addressing persistent barriers and gaps, and advancing sustainable, resilient and inclusive growth and industrial development. Our efforts will be geared towards ensuring Africa can fulfil its potential to become a global sustainable energy hub using relevant platforms, such as the UNDP Center for Climate, Energy and Environment established by the Italian Presidency.
Furthermore, we strongly support the creation of new sustainable energy generation capacity in Africa and the Mediterranean to contribute to global decarbonization goals, in our common fight against climate change, as well as the development of greater interconnectivity to help reduce the cost of the energy transition. We encourage and actively support the acceleration of private investment, including through public-private partnerships, increasing Africa's integration with the global energy market, in particular through the Mediterranean region.
We continue exploring innovative financing sources for climate and biodiversity action and clean energy, innovative schemes such as payment for ecosystem services, green bonds and high-integrity biodiversity credits with environmental and social safeguards. In particular, we support the issuance of green bonds in low- and middle-income countries, particularly on the African continent, to encourage private financial flows for sustainable investments and the growth of capital markets, in line with existing initiatives such as the Global Green Bonds Initiative.
We acknowledge the importance of fiscal space and mobilizing resources from all sources for increased climate and development action particularly for low-income and vulnerable countries, and that the fights against climate change and poverty go hand in hand. We will implement effective policy frameworks to drive the necessary public and private investments. In this context, we welcome the Menu of Policy Options for a Just Transition towards Net Zero and the High-Level Framework for Public-Private Insurance Programs against Natural Hazards as a viable measure.
We will work with the MDBs, IFIs and other climate finance providers to take a coordinated approach to financing climate action, nature-based solutions, and sustainable energy projects in developing countries, including by supporting private finance and domestic resource mobilization. We will effectively prioritize our international support in the energy sector towards accelerating the clean energy transition. We call on other major economies and all the relevant entities to do the same.
We look forward to setting a new collective quantified goal on climate finance at COP29, and recognize that a new goal is a unique opportunity to strengthen the international climate finance landscape in this critical decade to keep 1.5°C within reach. We emphasize that G7 countries intend to be leading contributors to a fit-for-purpose goal, underlining the importance of including those countries that are capable of contributing to any international public finance mobilization. As assessed by the OECD, developed countries exceeded the annual goal of providing and mobilizing USD 100 billion in climate finance for developing countries in 2022, an achievement that we warmly welcome.
We note that, despite progress, there is a need to continue to scale up action and support, including finance for climate adaptation as called for in the Glasgow Climate Pact. We will continue supporting the most vulnerable developing countries in translating national adaptation plans and other national adaptation instruments into investment plans aligned with their needs and priorities, including through the G7 Adaption Accelerator Hub.
We emphasize the importance of whole-of-society approaches, with the meaningful participation of the people and communities on the frontlines of the triple crisis, including women, youth, and Indigenous Peoples. We recognize that they are disproportionately affected by the impacts of climate change and recognize their critical role as leaders and agents of change.
Recognizing the role of younger generations to promote climate action and drive a more sustainable future, we need to empower their voices and their participation. Building on successful initiatives, such as the Youth4Climate program, we commit to amplifying youth-led initiatives, enhancing educational opportunities, and bolstering advocacy efforts.
We are committed to halting and reversing biodiversity loss by 2030 and to the swift and full implementation of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (KMGBF) and achieving each of its goals and targets, including the 30 by 30 targets. For those G7 members that are parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), we will revise and submit updated National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans in alignment with the KMGBF or communicate national targets reflecting the KMGBF ahead of the 16th UN Biodiversity Conference. We recall our previous commitment to increase our national and international funding for nature by 2025, and to substantially and progressively increase the level of financial resources from all sources including by providing support to the Global Environment Facility. We commit to align all relevant financial and fiscal flows with the KMGBF. We note that Target 19 aims at mobilizing at least USD 200 billion per year by 2030 for biodiversity from all sources, including USD 20 billion per year by 2025 and USD 30 billion per year by 2030, through international financial resources. We are all still concerned about incentives, including subsidies, harmful to biodiversity, and call upon all relevant organizations to continue collaborating with us, including by assisting in identifying such incentives, and we are all working to fulfil our respective applicable commitments, including, inter alia, to identify these incentives by 2025, and redirect or eliminate them, while scaling-up positive incentives for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity by 2030 at the latest, taking initial steps without delay.
In this context we are committed to halt and reverse deforestation and forest and land degradation by 2030 globally. We are committed to promoting sustainable forest management and sustainable use of woods and advancing sustainable supply chains that decouple agricultural production from deforestation and forest and land degradation, recognizing the importance of demand and supply-side measures. We are committed to developing innovative financial solutions for conserving, protecting, and restoring forests, and in that context welcome the launch of country packages for forests, nature, and climate at COP28. We will also take steps to prevent, manage, and address the negative impacts of extreme wildfires.
We reiterate our deep concern about the health of the ocean and seas, and we are united in the call for transformative action on ocean governance to tackle the triple planetary crisis of climate change, biodiversity loss, and pollution. We will work towards a successful UNOC3 in 2025 in this regard. We commit to pursue the swift ratification, approval, acceptance, and accession of the agreement on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction and to contribute to a rapid entry into force and implementation.
We will accelerate efforts to decouple economic growth from negative environmental impacts and primary resource use by expanding the transformation of our economies to be net-zero, circular, climate-resilient, pollution-free and nature-positive. We are committed to end plastic pollution with the ambition to reduce additional plastic pollution to zero by 2040 and, as appropriate, reduce the global production and consumption of primary plastic polymers in the context of our actions throughout the full life cycle of plastic. We support efforts to develop an international legally binding instrument on plastic pollution of the highest ambition possible by the end of 2024, based on a comprehensive approach that addresses the full life cycle of plastic. We also continue our work to reduce air pollution. We call on the global community to do the same. We will step up our efforts to increase resource efficiency and circular economy. They can reduce pressure on primary resources and play a key role in mitigating the adverse impacts of resource extraction and processing, while, at the same time, increasing the resilience of our economies to potential future shocks and fostering innovation and sustainability.
Safe water and healthy soils and ecosystems, including marine and coastal ecosystems, are vital for preserving life and livelihoods, and mitigating climate change and environmental degradation's impact, including climate-induced displacement, particularly in Africa. We express concern about Russia's environmentally unsustainable and unfair trading practices regarding fish and seafood products. We look forward to successful outcomes at the upcoming Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD COP16) in Colombia and the UN Conference to Combat Desertification (UNCCD COP16) in Saudi Arabia. With this aim, the Italian G7 Presidency is setting up a Hub on Sustainable Use of Land, dedicated to promoting a collaborative and common approach to sustainable land use initiatives in Africa and the Mediterranean Basin. Recognizing the importance of water and sanitation for sustainable development, prosperity and peace, we endorse the establishment of a G7 Water Coalition to coordinate our action and strengthen our cooperation on water-related issues, and we welcome the organization of the One Water Summit in Riyadh at the margins of UNCCD COP16.
We reaffirm the critical role our DFIs can play in contributing to the mobilization of finance from all sources for advancing G7 energy, climate and environment commitments.
Artificial Intelligence, Science, Technology, and Innovation 
Artificial Intelligence can play a crucial role in promoting progress and development in our societies. We will promote safe, secure, and trustworthy AI. We will pursue an inclusive, human-centered, digital transformation that underpins economic growth and sustainable development, maximizes benefits, and manages risks, in line with our shared democratic values and respect for human rights.
In this regard, we recognize the need for approaches to AI governance that foster inclusion, to help us harness the potential of AI in a way that reflects these values and promotes its development while mitigating risks, including with respect to human rights and avoiding governance fragmentation. We will work toward these objectives by actively cooperating with other stakeholders, organizations and initiatives as relevant, such as the Global Partnership on AI (GPAI) and the OECD. We will build on the outcomes of the AI Seoul Summit and upcoming milestones, including this year's UN Summit of the Future and the AI Action Summit in 2025.
Recognizing the importance of advancing the Hiroshima AI Process outcomes, we welcome support from the countries and organizations beyond the G7, as demonstrated by its Friends Group.
We will step up our efforts to enhance interoperability amongst our AI governance approaches to promote greater certainty, transparency and accountability while recognizing that approaches and policy instruments may vary across G7 members. We will take a risk-based approach in these efforts as we seek to foster innovation and strong, inclusive, and sustainable growth. To achieve this goal, we will step up our coordination around the evolution of our governance and regulatory frameworks, including by sharing best practices. We will enhance our regular consultations. We are also committed to deepening coordination between our respective institutes and offices focused on AI, to work towards shared understanding of risk management and advance international standards for AI development and deployment. We welcome our Industry, Tech, and Digital Ministers' efforts to advance the Hiroshima AI Process' outcomes released last year, including the development of a reporting framework for monitoring the International Code of Conduct for Organizations Developing Advanced AI Systems. We look forward to the pilot of the reporting framework, developed in cooperation with the OECD, in view of the Industry, Tech, and Digital Ministers' Meeting in October. We will work towards developing a brand that can be used to identify organizations that are voluntarily participating in and implementing the Code's forthcoming reporting framework.
We welcome the G7 Toolkit for Artificial Intelligence in the Public Sector, that can help governments to deliver better services to our economies and societies, while protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms.
We will work to ensure that AI enables increased productivity, quality jobs, and decent work; empowers workers; fosters inclusiveness and equal opportunities in the world of work; and enhances active labor market policies, including by fostering dialogue and transparency with workers organizations. To achieve these goals, we will launch an action plan on the use of AI in the world of work. We ask our Labor Ministers to develop the action plan, envisaging concrete actions to fully leverage the potential of AI to enable decent work and workers' rights and full access to adequate reskilling and upskilling, while addressing potential challenges and risks to our labor markets. We emphasize the need to anticipate future skills needs, provide higher education opportunities and equip workers and employers with the skills and competencies needed to design, adopt, and work with a human-centric, safe, secure and trustworthy AI. Against this background, we also emphasize the importance of innovative education, international talent mobility, digital competencies, and personalized lifelong learning to meet the demand for a qualified workforce. We recognize and encourage the work of the private sector to address skills gaps, including through the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence's Working Group on the Future of Work.
Acknowledging the key role that emerging technologies can play in economic growth, we commit to enhancing cooperation to bolster the adoption and development of new technologies, including AI, among micro, small, and medium enterprises, thereby fostering inclusive economic growth.
As we look to the future of emerging technologies, we encourage transparency and adherence to international workers' rights and labor standards at each stage of the AI supply chain. We also encourage our competition authorities to monitor the development of the AI industry, with a view to addressing potential competition issues, and prevent adverse effects at an early stage.
We will also work, including with developing countries and emerging economies, towards closing digital divides, including the gender digital divide, and achieving digital inclusion. We welcome the UN General Assembly Resolution on Seizing the Opportunities of Safe, Secure and Trustworthy AI Systems for Sustainable Development, which advances international conversations on AI, including to promote equitable access to the benefits of AI for all. We will leverage the benefits of AI for SDGs by closing gaps in technologies for development, and by strengthening research and development ecosystems. To this end, G7 countries seek to promote safe, secure and inclusive practices, tools and solutions to make the benefits of AI and advanced computing available to partners to advance their development. In this regard, we welcome the Italian Presidency's decision to establish the AI Hub for Sustainable Development, in collaboration with UNDP. The Hub aims to enable multistakeholder partnerships to support local AI digital ecosystems, strengthen capacities to advance AI for sustainable development, and complement existing initiatives including the AI for Development Donors Partnership.
We reiterate the importance of operationalizing Data Free Flow with Trust (DFFT) to enable trustworthy cross-border data flows, and invigorate the digital economy as a whole, while preserving governments' ability to address legitimate public interest. We value OECD's leading role in advancing DFFT and we welcome its expert community.
Acknowledging the crucial role of resilient and reliable global semiconductor supply chains, we welcome the establishment of a Semiconductors G7 Point of Contact Group. This Group will bolster our coordination in addressing issues impacting the semiconductor industry. We will also advance our cooperation on secure and resilient undersea cable connectivity, in particular for strategic routes such as the Arctic and the Pacific. Our efforts will include better coordination on technical security requirements and advancing research on the economic and environmental sustainability of cable connectivity.
Given the potential of quantum technology developments, we will adopt or implement our respective quantum strategies. We also affirm our commitment to promoting responsible innovation of biotechnology, including its convergence with AI.
We support the development of frontier science, emerging technologies and research infrastructures to solve global challenges, including a better understanding of the ocean-climate-biodiversity nexus. We also emphasize the importance of promoting international talent mobility and circulation in emerging technologies among the G7 and partners, as well as cooperation with low and middle-income countries. In this regard, we reiterate our commitment to open science and research security and integrity.
We support further efforts to promote and reinforce research security and integrity, together with like-minded partners. We welcome the Extension of the G7 Virtual Academy to non-G7 like-minded partners to share best practices and policies on research security and integrity, and we welcome that Italy will host a G7 conference on these topics this year.
We recognize the impact of AI on the military domain and the need for a framework for responsible development and use. We welcome those who have endorsed the Political Declaration on Responsible Military Use of AI and Autonomy (REAIM) and the REAIM Call to Action, and we encourage more states to do so to ensure that military use of AI is responsible, complies with applicable international law, particularly international humanitarian law, and enhances international security.
We strongly support the implementation of the International Guidelines adopted at the UN Committee on the Peaceful Use of Outer Space as urgent and necessary. We welcome national efforts to develop further solutions for space debris mitigation and remediation, including further research and development of orbital debris mitigation and remediation technologies, and the development of space sustainability standards and regulations.
We welcome the establishment of the G7 Venice Justice Group, which will serve as a coordinative function to address global challenges, including AI, using our judicial and enforcement expertise. Against this background, we recognize the impacts of deploying AI within the justice sector and that the use of AI systems must not interfere with the decision-making power of judges nor judicial independence.
Labor and Employment 
We will continue promoting job quality and decent work as well as the fundamental principles and rights at work, including the right to safe and healthy working environments, underlining the important role of social dialogue and collective bargaining in this regard. We commit to ensure full respect of international labor standards and human rights to promote fair and non-exploitative working conditions, including in global value chains, in particular the fundamental conventions adopted by the ILO. We will promote technical cooperation on these issues and will intensify our efforts to abolish all forms of forced and compulsory labor and child labor. We will continue advancing the inclusion of persons with disabilities and accelerating gender and other forms of equality in the world of work. We underscore the importance of continuing investing in human capital and lifelong learning systems that provide high-quality job opportunities for all, including those in the green and digital economy. To address the challenges of ageing societies, we will continue to work for resilient labor markets and to promote active and healthy ageing, addressing obstacles to labor market participation, especially of the underrepresented groups, and will promote solutions to improve working conditions in the care sector to make it more attractive for job seekers and qualified workers and to better support our citizens over their life-course.
Cybersecurity 
The security of our societies increasingly depends on an open, interoperable, safe, secure, resilient, human rights respecting use of cyberspace. We rely on the continuing work of the Ise-Shima Cyber Group in advancing responsible state behavior in cyberspace, through the application of international law, including IHL, effective confidence-building measures, targeted capacity-building initiatives, based on a multistakeholder approach, and integrating cybersecurity into the development agenda. We reaffirm our support for the Program of Action to Advance Responsible State' Behaviour in the Use of ICTs in the context of international security, as the permanent and action-oriented mechanism to hold discussions on cybersecurity at the UN from 2025 onwards.
We are resolute in countering strategic threats and in holding malicious cyber actors to account. Our relevant institutions will intensify their work on enhancing information exchange and coordination. We are committed to taking concrete steps to improve our collective resilience through the newly established G7 Cybersecurity Working Group leveraging synergies with the Ise-Shima Cyber Group.
We are pursuing a four-fold approach to counter malicious cyber activities: i) promoting responsible state behavior in cyber space, ii) improving cybersecurity, including in the private sector; iii) developing and using tools to deter and respond to malicious (state) behavior and to cyber criminals, and disrupt the infrastructure they use, including by enhancing coordination on attribution processes; and iv) strengthening our partners' cyber security capacity.
To counter the rise in ransomware attacks by cybercriminals, we continue to make best use of the International Counter Ransomware Initiative and will coordinate our efforts to avoid ransom payments. We will also consider actions to impose costs on malicious actors.
We recognize rising cyber threats to critical infrastructure, in particular in the energy sector, which is heavily targeted by adversarial countries and criminals. We will continue discussions on good cybersecurity practices in these sectors, including ways to increase supply chains resilience and security, whilst acknowledging existing regulatory frameworks. To incentivize tech companies to build more secure Internet of Things products we will promptly explore avenues towards establishing mutual recognition of schemes for reliable cyber-safe products. We strongly encourage manufacturers to improve the security of products throughout their life cycle and make them secure-by-design and secure-by-default.
We are willing to work with all those who share our common objective to ensure a cyberspace that supports inclusive and democratic societies, narrows the gender gap in this field, and promotes multistakeholder partnerships, including with the private sector.
Migration 
We affirm our collective commitment to addressing migration as a global phenomenon, tackling the challenges it presents and seizing the opportunities it brings globally, through an integrated, comprehensive, balanced approach, in line with international law. We recognize that developing sustainable, inclusive solutions to effectively manage migration to the benefit of all, including low- and middle-income countries facing significant migratory pressures, demands collective actions carried out in a spirit of commitment and joint responsibility. We will work to ensure a governance of migration that is increasingly effective and sustainable within the framework of our international obligations, relevant treaties and conventions. While doing so, we reaffirm our commitment to ensuring full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, regardless of their migratory status, and, in this regard, we also recall the right of everyone to seek asylum from persecution as per the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and to seek international protection as safeguarded by the Geneva Convention on Refugees.
Against this background, we will enhance cooperation by promoting a three-pronged approach, in partnership with countries of origin and transit, focusing on: (i) the root causes of irregular migration, through sustainable development initiatives, economic investment, and stabilization efforts, in partnership with countries of origin and transit; (ii) efforts to enhance border management and enforcement and curb transnational organized crime involved in migrant smuggling and trafficking in persons; (iii) safe and regular pathways for migration. Our vision draws also on the principles of the Rome Process, the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection, as well as the Global Forum on Migration and Development.
Under the first pillar, we will enhance efforts to address the root causes of irregular migration and forced displacement—such as conflict, political instability, poverty, crime, corruption, and human rights abuses. We also acknowledge that climate change is a risk multiplier, intersecting with and exacerbating other drivers of mobility. We aim to foster comprehensive and equitable partnerships between countries of origin, transit, and destination to pave the way for long-term structural solutions that contribute to sustainable development, resilience, and stability. We will strengthen collaboration and regional efforts to support economic, governance, social, and environmental conditions, enabling all individuals to live and thrive in their own countries, safeguarding their safety, rights, and dignity. In this regard, we acknowledge that countries of origin and countries and communities hosting large numbers of migrants and refugees may need international financial assistance to support development, as well as humanitarian assistance, security, public health, education and employment. To do so, we will leverage our policies and actions, to ensure that we address the root causes of irregular migration.
For the second pillar, we will step up our efforts to prevent and address irregular migration, counter the illegal activities that facilitate it, and tackle the challenges it poses to individuals and societies. We affirm the sovereign right of states to control their borders, as well as their prerogative to govern migration within their jurisdiction, in conformity with international law. We promote actions that are in line with international law, including international human rights law, and the principle of non-refoulement. We will employ a whole-of-route approach, and work towards strategies aimed at deterring individuals from embarking on irregular and perilous migration journeys.
In particular, we will work to strengthen border management and visa policies and processes, also with a view to limit the activities of migrant smuggling and trafficking networks. We will also work collectively to support the safe and dignified return of persons not eligible to remain, as well as to support sustainable reintegration efforts in countries of origin. We will leverage our collective diplomatic efforts in encouraging countries to readmit their nationals, in line with their international commitments and through due processes.
In line with the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC) and its Protocols, we will also strengthen our actions to prevent, counter, and dismantle organized criminal networks that profit from the smuggling of migrants and trafficking in persons and disrupt their business models. To this end, we are launching a G7 Coalition to Prevent and Counter the Smuggling of Migrants. Through this initiative, we will promote enhanced cooperation on investigative capacities, engaging relevant authorities in countries of origin, transit, and destination. We will encourage advancements toward improved and reliable data exchanges, crucial for evidence-based joint enforcement actions against smuggling and trafficking networks. We will utilize a ""follow the money"" approach to effectively identify, investigate, and disrupt organized crime, tackling financial aspects, including enhanced cooperation on asset confiscation. We also recognize the importance of raising awareness and informing potential migrants on the risks associated with migrant smuggling and trafficking in persons, to deter them from embarking on perilous routes. We task our G7 Interior and Security Ministers, in coordination with other relevant Ministers, to create a dedicated Action Plan to advance the G7 Coalition, to be adopted at the upcoming Interior and Security Ministers meeting. In implementing this Action Plan, we will ensure the Coalition works through ongoing partnerships and mechanisms, including with UNODC and other relevant United Nations bodies, the Financial Action Task Force, INTERPOL, EUROPOL, the EU's Global Alliance to Counter Migrant Smuggling, and through G7 frameworks such as the Roma-Lyon Group and the Venice Justice Group.
For the third pillar, we acknowledge the importance of safe and regular pathways for migrants and refugees as part of comprehensive, whole-of-route migration management strategies. Regular pathways can represent realistic alternatives and have the potential to reduce irregular migration and the use of smuggling and trafficking networks, and contribute to preventing the adverse humanitarian consequences of embarking on perilous routes. In this regard, we reaffirm our commitment to ensuring safe, orderly, and regular migration, and recognize the important economic and social benefits that migrants can bring to our countries as well as to low- and middle-income countries, including through remittances.
Regular pathways need to respond to national requirements, adhere to our legislations, sovereign decisions, and to the principles of fair recruitment. Driven by a spirit of joint responsibility, we will advance cooperation on regular pathways, including by supporting partner countries in improving migration governance while addressing the challenges and risks associated with irregular migration. In this context, we acknowledge ongoing regional efforts aimed at securing talents and professional mobility, as well as programs aimed at establishing and sustaining effective avenues for resettlement. These initiatives can provide safe and legal pathways for migrants while also addressing labor gaps in countries of destination. They should be designed in consideration of the needs of vulnerable populations and employ gender- and age-sensitive approaches, to prevent abuses and exploitation, protect human rights and dignity, and enhance safety and security worldwide. As such, we will continue to include regular pathways as part of our comprehensive policy frameworks, including labor pathways implemented in partnership with developing countries, as appropriate. We will promote their effective and lawful utilization, while sustaining and encouraging discussions on these matters in relevant international and regional fora, towards increasingly shared and collaborative approaches.
Global Economy and Finance 
We acknowledge that the global economy has shown greater resilience than expected, but it remains exposed to risks arising from geopolitical tensions, renewed volatility in energy prices, and further disruptions to the smooth functioning of supply chains. Our policy efforts will continue to focus on promoting innovation, the just green and digital transitions, and productivity growth, while gradually rebuilding fiscal buffers, and ensuring price and financial stability. We also reaffirm our existing G7 exchange rate commitments. We express concerns about the comprehensive use of non- market policies and practices that create global spillovers. We encourage work, among all relevant tracks, to assess the macroeconomic impact of subsidies, and other industrial and trade policy measures globally, based on comparable information; and to foster a dialogue with non-G7 countries on issues related to industrial policies, economic fragmentation, market concentration risks and overcapacity. To achieve these goals, we will enhance cooperation to advance a G7 dialogue between relevant ministries, and, as appropriate, also engage partners beyond the G7, in addition to the IMF, WBG, WTO, and OECD.
We underline the importance of the work carried out by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and the Standard-setting Bodies to identify, monitor and address vulnerabilities in the financial system. We strongly support ongoing work to enhance the resilience of the nonbank financial intermediation sector. We also reaffirm our commitment to implement effective regulatory and supervisory frameworks for crypto assets, and welcome initiatives to take forward the G20 Roadmap for Enhancing Cross-border Payments. We reiterate the importance of stepping up global efforts to combat money-laundering, terrorist, and proliferation financing, and support the relevant Financial Action Task Force (FATF)'s initiatives.
We reiterate our strong political commitment to a more stable and fairer international tax system, fit for the 21st century. We are committed to finalizing the work within the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework, with a view to open for signature the Multilateral Convention on Pillar One by the end of June 2024, and we call for further progress on the implementation of Pillar Two. We welcome progress made on tax transparency and support the effective implementation of the Crypto Asset Reporting Framework by the relevant jurisdictions. We remain committed to fostering international cooperation on tax issues, building on existing achievements, with the broad participation of developing and developed countries. We will continue to work constructively with the Brazilian G20 Presidency to advance international cooperation. We will work to increase our efforts aimed at progressive and fair taxation of individuals. We acknowledge the discussions at the UN Ad Hoc Committee for a Framework Convention on International Tax Cooperation, emphasizing the importance of consensus-based decisions to support a stable and predictable international tax system, promote inclusive and effective international tax cooperation, prioritizing issues such as enhancing domestic resource mobilization and tax capacity building for developing countries and emerging markets.
Mounting debt burdens are constraining the ability of low- and middle-income countries to invest in their futures and achieve the SDGs. We call on all stakeholders to redouble efforts and improve the ability to help low- and middle-income countries that fall into debt distress. This includes finalizing outstanding country cases, making future debt treatment more transparent and timelier, and improving our toolkits to put countries tackling reforms on a more sustainable footing before they fall into crisis. We look forward to the G20 improving the implementation of the Common Framework for debt treatment beyond the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) in a predictable, timely, orderly, and coordinated manner, providing more clarity to debtors and creditors and building on lessons learned. Beyond the Common Framework, debt vulnerabilities in middle-income countries should be addressed by enhancing multilateral coordination. We underline the importance of debt transparency and information sharing in debt restructurings and call on all creditors' participation in data-sharing exercises. We encourage the Global Sovereign Debt Roundtable (GSDR) to continue its work, fostering a constructive and inclusive dialogue among all parties. We welcome the development of Climate Resilient Debt Clauses (CRDCs) and encourage more creditors to offer CRDCs.
We reiterate our firm commitment to evolve and strengthen MDBs to address the most pressing development and global challenges, and welcome further discussions in line with our G20 commitment to achieve better, bigger, and more effective MDBs. We welcome the considerable progress that MDBs have already achieved and will continue to support them. We also welcome that the implementation of the G20 MDBs Capital Adequacy Framework (CAF) Review has already secured over USD 200 billion of additional financing for the next ten years and call for further CAF implementation to unlock additional significant financing while safeguarding MDBs excellent credit ratings and preferred creditor status.
We are committed to delivering innovative instruments at the MDBs such as hybrid capital and portfolio guarantees, for which the G7 and other donors have already demonstrated their support. Once approved domestically, current G7 commitments to these instruments will make it possible to further boost World Bank lending by around USD 70 billion over the next ten years. We also commend the AfDB for its successful first issuance of hybrid capital to market investors. We call on the MDBs to jointly explore ways to better reflect the value of callable capital in their capital adequacy methodologies, including through further discussions with credit rating agencies.
We reaffirm the importance of continuing to provide significant concessional support to low-income countries. In this regard, we welcome the successful replenishment of the Asian Development Fund (AsDF14) support a successful International Development Association (IDA21) replenishment and commit to work toward a successful replenishment of the African Development Fund next year (AfDF17). We recognize that contributions from all stakeholders are needed, and we support efforts to broaden the donor base.
We strongly support the IMF's commitment towards the most vulnerable, including through our contributions to the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT). We reiterate the call on all IMF members who are able to contribute, especially those that have not yet done so, to consider providing financial support. We look forward to a comprehensive and timely review of the PRGT, and we are open to discuss all viable options, including the use of internal resources, to ensure the long term financial self-sustainability of the PRGT and to help meet the growing needs of low-income countries. We welcome the interim review of the IMF's Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST) and its focus on resilience to climate change and pandemics.
We support the Alliance for Green Infrastructure in Africa (AGIA), as an innovative financial mechanism of the African Development Bank in partnership with the African Union, Africa50 and other development partners, aimed at mobilizing blended capital to design and develop a USD 10 billion bankable portfolio of transformative green infrastructure projects in Africa to accelerate the energy transition, bridge the long-standing infrastructure gap and promote climate resilience. As G7, we will collectively contribute up to USD 150 million in grants, concessional and commercial capital to AGIA and we expect to help leverage around up to USD 3 billion of private sector investment in green infrastructure in Africa.
We look forward to the seventh edition of the OECD World Forum on Wellbeing to be hosted by Italy in Rome on 4-6 November 2024, focusing, inter alia, on policy issues, such as climate change and AI, from a well-being perspective.
Trade 
Global threats, particularly Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine, including its continuous attempts to disrupt maritime trade in the Black Sea and the persistent Houthi attacks on commercial vessels transiting the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, have highlighted the critical need to address vulnerabilities in global supply chains, ports, and trade flows.
To meet these challenges, we launched the G7 Working Group on Transport Supply Chains, which will enhance the G7's ability to strengthen the resilience of transport flows and networks.
We remain united in our commitment to the rules-based, free and fair, equitable, and transparent multilateral trading system, with the World Trade Organization (WTO) at its core. Despite the lack of more ambitious outcomes, we recognize the results of the 13th WTO Ministerial Conference (MC13). We welcome the decision to maintain the moratorium on customs duties on electronic transmissions until MC14 and we reiterate our support for a permanent prohibition. We are committed to working towards a prompt conclusion of negotiations of the Joint Statement Initiative on E-Commerce.
We underscore the need to reform the WTO's monitoring, deliberative, and negotiating functions and remain committed to conducting discussions with a view to having a fully and well-functioning dispute settlement system accessible to all Members by the end of 2024. We call on relevant countries to refrain from claiming special and differential treatment in the WTO, commensurate with their economic weight and role in the global trading system. We also call for an ambitious and comprehensive agreement on global fisheries subsidies.
Multilateral cooperation must be underpinned by fair competition, predictability, and sustainability. In this regard, we reaffirm our attachment to transparency, to coordination, and to the respect of WTO rules in our respective policies. We will step up our efforts towards a global level playing field and reiterate our commitment to keep our economies open and competitive. We will also tackle non-market policies and practices, such as harmful subsidies, including by State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) and forced technology transfers, notably when these policies and practices are used targeting sectors for dominance. We commit to effectively use our trade tools, including new ones, as appropriate, to identify, challenge, and counter these practices, and to promote stronger international rules and norms, together with partners.
Acknowledging the important role of trade in addressing global environmental challenges, we will support WTO deliberations that contribute to achieve COP28 commitments, including plurilateral initiatives such as those facilitating and promoting trade in environmental goods, services and technologies, and fighting plastic pollution.
We acknowledge that our trade policies, as well as public and private investments in the industries of the future, both at home and around the world, will play a major role in achieving common goals of addressing the climate crisis and accelerating the global clean energy transition. We also acknowledge that further cooperation is necessary to fill the investment gap for the clean energy transition to lower the cost of the energy transition worldwide. In this context, we stress that, in driving the clean energy economy of the future, we will cooperate openly and transparently in a coordinated manner, reflecting our joint commitment not to act at each other's expense.
We will continue to promote inclusive trade recognizing the unique challenges that underrepresented groups, including women and indigenous peoples, face, and their role to ensuring sustainable economic growth.
Economic Resilience and Economic Security 
Building on the progress we made on our strategic coordination since Hiroshima, we reinforce our commitment to promote economic resilience and economic security, in partnership and cooperation within and beyond the G7. In particular, we are building resilient economies and supply chains, ensuring our toolkits to respond to harmful practices are fit for purpose, and safeguarding critical and emerging technology that could be used to threaten international peace and security.
Recognizing that economic resilience requires de-risking through diversification and reduction of critical dependencies, including those resulting from overcapacity, we will implement the principles on resilient and reliable supply chains, namely transparency, diversification, security, sustainability, trustworthiness and reliability. We will do so by actively engaging with partners and the private sector, within and beyond the G7, while preserving economic dynamism and openness. We encourage the public and private sectors to make coordinated efforts to strengthen the supply chains resilience of strategic goods, in terms of both supply and demand. This will include seeking to collectively identify critical goods, strategic sectors, and supply chains, for future coordination within the G7 on relevant criteria that take into account not only economic factors, but also factors linked to the principles above.
We will champion initiatives to increase participation of a broader range of low- and middle-income countries in Africa and elsewhere in global supply chains, while promoting high standards and creating benefits for local workers and communities everywhere. We will also reduce our partners' vulnerability. We reaffirm the need to accelerate coordinated initiatives on critical minerals such as the Partnership for Resilient and Inclusive Supply-chain Enhancement (RISE), the Mineral Security Partnership (MSP) and its MSP Forum.
We are more committed than ever to work together to address harmful market distortions and global excess capacity in key sectors resulting from non-market policies and practices, such as pervasive, opaque and harmful industrial subsidies, market distortive practices of SOEs and all forms of forced technology transfers. We acknowledge that such practices not only undermine the free and fair rules-based international economic order, but may also exacerbate strategic dependencies and vulnerabilities, and hinder emerging and developing countries' sustainable development.
Against this background, we will ensure that our toolkits are fit for purpose and strengthen our coordination. We will pursue joint monitoring to assess how non-market policies and practices are producing harmful overcapacities and other spillover effects. We commit to strengthen the exchange of information, including with like-minded countries, and consult on our respective responses, with a view to greater effectiveness, while avoiding unintended negative effects and considering the security of supply chains. We will intensify diplomatic efforts with those contributing to overcapacity to address the issue at its source, while engaging developing countries and emerging markets to collaborate towards a more equitable global trade and investment environment.
We will work together with partners to ensure that attempts or threats to weaponize economic dependencies will fail and stand ready to take actions, where necessary, against economic coercion. We will increase our collective assessment, preparedness, deterrence, and response, developing new tools, as appropriate, in line with our respective legal systems and international law. We will address potential, emerging, and ongoing cases, including through the G7 Coordination Platform on Economic Coercion, with partners beyond the G7. We will also support, as appropriate, targeted states, economies, and entities and we task the Platform to actively monitor areas of concern and key threats.
We recognize that evolving technologies present opportunities, but also risks. Recognizing that rapid advances are changing the nature of dual-use technology, we will promote efforts to ensure that gaps in our dual-use technology protection ecosystem cannot be exploited. We will ensure that our tools are sufficiently flexible to keep pace with the rapid development of new technologies, while avoiding undue restrictions on international trade and investment. We have a common interest in preventing a narrow set of technological advances that are assessed to be core to enhancing the military and intelligence capabilities of actors who may use these capabilities to undermine international peace and security, from being fueled by our companies' capital, expertise and knowledge.
Today we are taking the following steps:
We commit to safeguarding the global research ecosystem and preserving open research collaboration. We will strengthen existing multilateral research security and integrity efforts and work to prevent covert and forced transfer of intellectual property, data, and sensitive technology.
We will increase our capacity to monitor and exchange information on the use of critical minerals as a potential economic coercion threat and will work to prevent risks of supply chain disruptions caused by attempts to weaponize economic dependencies, stemming from monopolization or lack of diversification of existing suppliers.
We will continue to assess the risks posed by exports of rapidly advancing dual-use technologies, including quantum technologies, and will promote efforts, where necessary and according to our respective legal frameworks, to implement export controls to address risks to international security. We will also work, as appropriate, with our partners to further develop the understanding of how export controls can be implemented quickly and in an assured manner to protect national and international security.
We will work to ensure the effectiveness of our respective foreign investment screenings, recognizing that some foreign investments may present risks to international peace and security, as well as national security, including by providing access to sensitive technologies, data, and expertise.
We continue to work to make our economic security toolkit fit to address the risks that our most sensitive technology could be used to threaten international peace and security. In this context, we believe that appropriate measures designed to address risks from outbound investments could be important to complement existing tools of targeted controls on exports and inbound investments. We will continue to engage with and provide clarity to the private sector regarding these common and urgent goals.
We reaffirm the importance of measures that strengthen data free flow with trust by addressing new risks to international peace and security posed by the interaction of data and advanced technologies, such as AI. We recognize our common interest in ensuring the highest standards for sensitive data protection and security, including genomic data.
We will work toward ways to safeguard dual-use biotechnology items and equipment, based on evidence of risks associated with bio-convergence.
We welcome the OECD Ministerial Council Meeting (MCM) in May, that facilitated our collaboration on economic resilience and economic security among like-minded countries beyond the G7.
Health 
We will continue promoting a One Health approach, bolstering prevention and health systems, further contributing to achieving Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and promoting equitable access to quality health services and essential medical countermeasures (MCMs). We reaffirm our commitment to accelerating progress towards SDG 3, ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all at all ages. Furthermore, we recommit to ending HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria, in particular by supporting the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, as well as neglected tropical diseases and polio as public health threats by 2030, and countering climate change effects on infectious diseases, which are already seen globally, including in recent cholera and dengue outbreaks.
More broadly, we reaffirm the objectives of the COP28 Declaration on Climate and Health to transform health systems to be climate-resilient, equitable, low-carbon, and sustainable.
In this respect, we recognize the need to strengthen the Global Health Architecture (GHA), with the World Health Organization (WHO) at its core. Strengthening the GHA and Pandemic, Preparedness and Response (PPR) requires public and private financing. We commit to strengthening coordination between Finance and Health tracks for pandemic PPR and to continue exploring innovative mechanisms for response financing including through the work of the G20 Joint Task Force on Finance and Health. We call for continued support to i) the Pandemic Fund, including expanding the donor base and calling for at least USD 2 billion in new pledges and co-financing that is equal or greater than that; ii) strengthening G7 collaboration to support regional diversification of development and manufacturing MCMs, including regional vaccines manufacturing initiatives, as well as last mile delivery as an essential element to enhance equity; iii) the conclusion of the process and the prompt operationalization of the pandemic preparedness component of the IMF's Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST), in cooperation with the World Bank and WHO; and iv) impact investment initiatives such as the Impact Investment Initiative for Global Health.
Additionally, we welcome the MCM Surge Financing Initiative that relevant G7 DFIs, along with the European Investment Bank and the International Finance Corporation, are developing to build institutional capacity and ensure immediate financing to procure, produce and deliver MCMs in low- and middle-income countries during future pandemics. We welcome the development of new DFIs-led and shared MCM surge financing facilities in 2024. Relevant DFIs and IFIs intend to sign a Memorandum of Understanding this year, in coordination with other global and regional health organizations to make further progress on this initiative. We look forward to the sustainable replenishments of Gavi, as well as the WHO and the Global Fund.
We note the importance of strengthening alignment and collaboration across the global health financing ecosystem in support of country-led priorities towards Universal Health Coverage (UHC) informed by the Conclusions of the Future of Global Health Initiatives Process.
We commit to advancing UHC and investing in resilient health systems, primary healthcare service delivery, and a skilled health workforce—including through the WHO Academy, the G20 Public Health Workforce Laboratorium, and the UHC Knowledge Hub. In this context, we commit to further promote comprehensive sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) for all, and to advance maternal, newborn, child, and adolescent health, especially for those in vulnerable circumstances.
We will continue supporting research efforts and leveraging emerging technologies, including the ethical use of AI, to develop new treatments and therapies, improve diagnostic tools and technologies, and address existing and emerging health challenges, while ensuring privacy and promoting interoperability.
We emphasize the importance of life-long prevention for healthy and active ageing, by promoting healthy lifestyles and science-based diet models based, to the extent possible, on locally grown products, beneficial for both human health and the environment, and tackling health determinants and non-communicable diseases, particularly mental health, and cancer.
We remain deeply concerned with antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and other health challenges exacerbated by the triple planetary crisis of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution, including in low and middle-income countries. Ahead of the UNGA High-Level Meeting on AMR in September 2024, we will support an ambitious outcome document that champions the needs of low- and middle-income countries and include concrete goals and targets that galvanize action alongside the mandate for an evidence-based panel to continue to drive action on AMR. We will continue promoting equitable access to essential antibiotics and integrated actions to counter AMR within a One Health Framework, by exploring and implementing infection prevention and control measures, as well as exercising stewardship for prudent and appropriate use of antimicrobials, including surveillance of their use and consumption. We will also implement push and pull incentives, support public-private partnerships and explore innovative instruments to accelerate research and development on new antimicrobials, their alternatives, and diagnostics.
Gender Equality 
We reaffirm our commitment to achieving gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls in all their diversity, through full, equal, and meaningful participation in all spheres of society. We express our strong concern about the rollback of the rights of women, girls, and LGBTQIA+ people around the world in particular in time of crisis and we strongly condemn all violations and abuses of their human rights and fundamental freedoms. We will continue promoting, and protecting their rights in all spheres of society, and consistently mainstreaming gender equality in all policy areas. We will work with global partners to advance gender equality in multilateral fora.
We recommit to preventing and addressing hate and discrimination, and to eliminating sexual and gender-based violence, including that facilitated by technology and trafficking in persons. We will provide comprehensive support and meaningful participation for victims and survivors. We reiterate our commitments in the Hiroshima Leaders' Communiqué to universal access to adequate, affordable, and quality health services for women, including comprehensive sexual and reproductive health and rights for all.
We continue to promote the full economic empowerment of all women and girls, and equal and meaningful participation and leadership in decision-making processes, including in the STEM sector. We will step up our efforts to address harmful gender norms, stereotypes, and practices, and to eliminate structural barriers and the gender pay gap, including through enhanced collaboration with the private sector and through supporting the adoption of gender equality certification systems for enterprises. We recognize the need to ensure affordable and quality childcare and long-term care services for all, support parenthood protection, promote work-life balance, and equal sharing of care responsibilities, to promote women's equal rights and to take a whole-of-society approach to address the demographic challenges faced by ageing societies. Against this background, we reiterate the importance of recognizing, reducing, and redistributing unpaid care work and rewarding paid care work adequately, guaranteeing care workers representation.
We will tackle the unequal gender distribution of care work, which contributes to gender inequalities. To this end, we aim by 2035 to support 200 million more women to join the workforce by investing in efforts to close the global gap in the availability of childcare, including through the World Bank Invest in Childcare Initiative.
We will promote applying a gender transformative, multi-sector approach to our foreign policy, humanitarian aid, and development cooperation, including on climate resilience, food security, education and migration. We commit to advance the Women, Peace, and Security Agenda, including its application to disaster risk reduction and eradicate all forms of gender-based violence, including conflict-related sexual violence, also by supporting women peacebuilders in conflict settings. We reiterate our commitment to collectively increase G7 ODA for gender equality and we will explore ways to do this at the nexus of climate change and gender, particularly in Africa.
Recognizing that quality education for all girls is the best predictor for future levels of equality, we must also promote access to safe, inclusive, and equitable quality education for all. Noting that 2024 is the African Union's Year of Education, we will enhance our partnership with African countries on girls' education, including through redoubling our efforts to meet the G7 Girls Education targets by 2026.
Recognizing the success of the 2X Challenge, we welcome the new commitment by Development and Multilateral Finance Institutions to invest at least USD 20 billion over three years in gender lens investing, encouraging investments at the nexus of gender and climate. We call upon other public and private actors to join the next 2X Challenge, advancing measurable changes and financing directed to women's empowerment.
We welcome the strengthened Gender Equality Advisory Council (GEAC) and its recommendations. Highlighting the importance of reliable sex and gender-disaggregated data collection and monitoring, we also welcome the updated G7 Dashboard on Gender Gaps.
Inclusion and Disability 
We are committed to ensuring that all individuals have equal rights to full and effective participation in social, cultural, educational, economic, and civil and political life. We intend to enhance all persons' talents and skills to make our communities stronger and more cohesive. We commit to further integrate disability rights across all political agendas, and in doing so, we welcome the first-ever G7 Inclusion and Disability Ministers meeting. We task our Ministers to launch the Solfagnano Charter, where they will articulate actions around universal access and accessibility, independent living, inclusive employment, service availability, emergency prevention and management, among others. We will step up our action for the implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD). We look forward to the Global Disability Summit to be held in Berlin in 2025.
Disarmament and Non-Proliferation 
We remain firmly committed to preventing the proliferation and use of all weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery.
We are greatly concerned by Russia's irresponsible nuclear rhetoric and actions, as well as its reported increasing use of chemical agents against Ukrainian forces. We reiterate that any use of chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear weapons by Russia would be met with severe consequences. We remain concerned about China's opaque and accelerating expansion of its nuclear arsenal. We will continue working to address North Korea's and Iran's continued advancement of nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Recalling the G7 Leaders' Hiroshima Vision on Nuclear Disarmament, we reaffirm our commitment to disarmament and non-proliferation efforts, with the ultimate goal of a world without nuclear weapons with undiminished security for all, achieved through a realistic, pragmatic, and responsible approach. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) is the cornerstone of the global nuclear non-proliferation regime and the foundation for the pursuit of nuclear disarmament and peaceful uses of nuclear energy. We believe that the overall decline in global nuclear arsenals achieved since the end of the Cold War must continue and not be reversed.
We highlight the need to bring the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) into force. In this regard, we call on Russia to continue to adhere to the moratorium on nuclear tests and renew the CTBT ratification. We also call on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) not to conduct any further nuclear tests, and to sign and ratify the CTBT.
We call for the immediate commencement of long-overdue negotiations within the Conference on Disarmament of a treaty banning the production of fissile material for use in nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices (FMCT) while urging all nuclear weapons States that have not yet done so to declare and maintain voluntary moratoria on the production of such material.
We remain steadfast in our support of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) and the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC), their universalization and full and effective implementation. We underline the importance of addressing biological threats worldwide. We will work to ensure that biological research, development, and innovation are conducted in a safe, secure, responsible, and sustainable manner.
We reiterate our commitment to the G7-led Global Partnership Against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction, a driving force behind global efforts to prevent, detect and respond to the acquisition and use of weapons of mass destruction by States and terrorists alike.
We are strengthening effective export controls on materials, technology, and research that could be used for military purposes in a way that keeps pace with rapid technological developments and recognizes the central role of multilateral export control regimes as a key non-proliferation instrument and safeguard for international peace and security.
We reiterate our commitment to safe, peaceful, responsible, and sustainable use of outer space, upholding existing legal frameworks including the Outer Space Treaty. We remain committed to fostering international cooperation and transparency, as well as confidence building measures and norms of responsible behavior with the goal of improving space security for all States.
We affirm the obligation of all States Parties to fully comply with the Outer Space Treaty, including not to place in orbit around the Earth any objects carrying nuclear weapons or any other kinds of weapons of mass destruction, install such weapons on celestial bodies, or station such weapons in outer space in any other manner.
Countering Terrorism, Violent Extremism and Transnational Organized Crime 
We condemn and counter terrorism and violent extremism in all their forms. We are determined to protect our societies' freedom and security, while upholding the rule of law and respecting human rights. We will continue to combat the financing of terrorism and terrorism propaganda, particularly the dissemination of terrorist content online. We will also promote information sharing, international cooperation, and capacity building, including in border management, to investigate and prosecute such crimes.
We reiterate our strong commitment to fighting transnational organized crime, breaking its business models, and dismantling its networks. Drug trafficking, smuggling of migrants, trafficking in persons and fraud are major sources of income for organized crime. We stand ready to work with other governments to address these transnational challenges, as well as crimes that affect the environment and against cultural heritage. Recalling our statement on Synthetic Drug Threats, including the significant health implications, we support the Global Coalition to Address Synthetic Drug Threats.
We also continue our unwavering commitment to tackling child sexual exploitation and abuse in all its forms to keep children safe online and in our communities around the world. It is crucial that all sectors, including the tech sector, step up and play their part in prioritizing child safety and working to combat this horrific crime.
Safeguarding Democratic Processes 
In a year during which millions worldwide choose their leaders and representatives, we reaffirm our commitment to safeguard democratic values and human rights. With the rapid evolution of emerging technology, we are more concerned than ever about Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference (FIMI) in our democratic institutions and processes, and how attempted interference campaigns, malicious cyber activities, and transnational repression collectively undermine sovereignty and democratic values.
We pledge to strengthen our coordinated efforts to better prevent, detect, and respond to FIMI threats through human rights-respecting practices and by supporting freedom of expression and free, independent, and pluralistic media. We ask our relevant Ministers to bolster the G7 Rapid Response Mechanism by creating by the end of the year a collective response framework to counter foreign threats to democracies, including publically exposing foreign operations of information manipulation. We also call on tech companies, in particular social media platforms, to intensify their efforts to prevent and counter FIMI campaigns and the potential abuse of AI for this purpose and work towards higher standards of transparency and accountability on these issues.
We will continue our cooperation with governments and non-governmental partners to work towards the promotion of fact-based, quality, and trustworthy information and will support relevant international initiatives, in particular in the UN and OECD.
Anti-corruption 
Corruption and related illicit finance drain public resources, fuel organized crime, and undermine democratic governance and progress across the SDGs. We endorse the G7 High-Level Principles on Anti-Corruption and commit to promoting technical assistance and capacity building to address existing gaps. We reaffirm the fundamental role that the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC) plays in the global fight against corruption and commit to further enhance the effectiveness of its Implementation Review Mechanism. We underscore the importance of denying corrupt actors access to our territories and financial systems.
Conclusions
We appreciate the exchanges with, and the inputs from, the G7 Engagement Groups. We are furthermore grateful for the valuable contributions from the Heads of the AfDB, the IMF, the OECD, the UN, and the WB, who joined us in Apulia.
We look forward to the Paris Olympic and Paralympic Games, and urge all countries to observe the Olympic Truce individually and collectively, as prescribed by the United Nations General Assembly Resolution ""Building a peaceful and better world through sports and the Olympic ideal"" adopted on 15 November 2023.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/joint-statement-group-seven-g-7-nation-leaders-g7-apulia-leaders-communique
Joe Biden,"July 05, 2024",Interview with George Stephanopoulos of ABC News,"STEPHANOPOULOS: Good evening from Madison, WI for a special edition of this week. The first broadcast interview with President Biden since last week's debate. Earlier this afternoon, we taped the 22 minute interview. There are no cuts, no edits. We have not touched it. At this pivotal moment in the presidential campaign, here it is:
STEPHANOPOULOS: Mr. President, thank you for doing this.
THE PRESIDENT: Thank you for having me.
STEPHANOPOULOS: Let's start with the debate. Ah, you and your team said—have said you had a bad night, but your—
THE PRESIDENT: I sure did—[laughs]
STEPHANOPOULOS: --but your friend Nancy Pelosi actually framed the question that I think is on the minds of millions of Americans. Was this a bad episode or the sign of a more serious condition?
THE PRESIDENT: It was a bad episode. Ah, No indicated any serious condition. I was exhausted. I didn't listen to my instincts in terms of preparing and — and I had a bad night.
STEPHANOPOULOS: You know, you say you were exhausted and, and I know you've said that before as well, but you came, and you did have a tough month, but you came home from Europe about 11 or 12 days before the debate. Spent six days in Camp David. Why wasn't that enough rest time? Enough recovery time?
THE PRESIDENT: Because I was sick, I was feelin' terrible. Matter of fact, the docs with me, I asked if they did a COVID test—'cause they were trying to figure out what's wrong. They did a test to see whether or not I had som-- some infection. You know, a virus. I didn't. I just had a really bad cold.
STEPHANOPOULOS: And, ah, did you ever watch the debate afterwards?
THE PRESIDENT: I don't think I did, no.
STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, what I'm trying--I want to get at is uh, what were you experiencing as you were going through the debate? Did you know how badly it was going?
THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, look. [pauses] The whole way I prepared—nobody's fault—mine. Nobody's fault but mine. I, uh, I prepared, what I usually would do, sittin' down as I did come back, with foreign leaders or the National Security Council, for explicit detail. And I realized—'bout partway through, that—you know, all—that--I get quoted that the New York Times had me down at ten points before the debate, nine now, or whatever the hell it is. The fact of the matter is, that what I looked at is that he also lied 28 times. I couldn't—I mean, the way the debate ran—not—my fault, nobody else's fault, no one else's fault—
STEPHANOPOULOS: But it seemed like you were having trouble from the first question in. Even before he spoke.
THE PRESIDENT: Well, I just had a bad night. You've had some bad interviews once in a while, like I can't remember any, but I'm sure you did.
STEPHANOPOULOS: I've had plenty. I, I guess the question—the problem is here for a lot of Americans watching is, you've said, going back to 2020, ""Watch me—""
THE PRESIDENT: Yeah.
STEPHANOPOULOS: --to people who are concerned about your age. And, you know, 50 million Americans watched that debate. It seemed to confirm fears they already had.
THE PRESIDENT: Well, look, after that debate I did ten major events, in a row including 'til 2:00 in the morning after that debate. I did events in North Carolina. I did events in, in, in Georgia. Did events like this, today—large crowds, overwhelming response. No, no, no slipping. And so I just had a bad night. I don't know why.
STEPHANOPOULOS: And, and, and, how quickly did it—did it come to you? That you were having that bad night?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, it came to me that I was havin' a bad night when I realized that even when I was answering the question, even though they turned his mic off, he was still shouting. And I, I let it distract me. That--but I'm not blaming it on that. But I realized that I just wasn't in control.
STEPHANOPOULOS: But part of the other concern is that, uh, this seems to have fit into a pattern of decline that has been reported on recently. New York Times had a headline on July 2nd: ""Biden's Lapses are Said to be Increasingly Common and Worrisome."" Here's what they wrote:
""People who've spent time with President Biden over the last few months or so said the lapses appear to have grown more frequent, more pronounced and after Thursday--Thursday's debate, more worrisome. By many accounts, as evidenced by video footage, observation, and interviews, Mr. Biden is not the same today as he was even when he took office three-and-a-half years ago."" Similar reporting in The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal.
Are you the same man today that you were when you took office three and a half years ago?
THE PRESIDENT: In terms of successes, yes. I also was the guy who put together a peace plan for the Middle East that may be comin' to fruition. I was also the guy that expanded NATO. I's also the guy that grew the economy. All the individual things that were done were ideas I had or I fulfilled. I moved on.
And so, for example, you know, well, well that was true then, what's Biden done lately? It's, it's, it's just today—just announced 200,000 new jobs. We're moving in a direction that no one's ever taken on. I know you know this from the days in the, in the, in the, in the government. I took on Big Pharma. I beat them. No one said I could beat them.
I took on, all the things we said, we got done—were told we couldn't get done. And part of it is—what I said when I ran was I wanted to do three things: Restore some decency to the Office; restore some support for the middle class instead of trickle down economics, build from the middle out and the bottom up the way the wealthy still do fine everyone does better; and unite the country.
STEPHANOPOULOS: But what has all that work over the last three-and-a-half years cost, you physically, mentally, emotionally?
THE PRESIDENT: Well. I, I, I just think it cost me a really bad night. A bad run. But--you know I, uh. --George, I have--I'm optimistic about this country. I don't think we're a country of losers that he points out. I don't think America's in tough shape. I think America is on the cusp of breaking through in so many incredible opportunities.
In this next term, I'm gonna make sure we gotta—straighten out the tax system. We're gonna make sure we're in a situation where we have health care for all people. Or we're in a position where we have, have child care and elder care. Free up and all these things.
One thing I'm proudest of, is, remember when my economic plan was put forward? A lot of the mainstream economists said it's not gonna work. Well, guess what? They now have 16 Nobel laureates, 16 of 'em, in economics, saying that Biden's next term would be sig—enor—based on what he wants to do—enormous success. Trump's plan would cause a recession, with sig, sig, sig increased inflation. I've made great progress and that's what I plan on doin'. And we can do this.
STEPHANOPOULOS: I, I, I, I understand that. And, and I'm not disputing that. What I'm asking you is, uh, about your personal situation. Do you dispute that there have been more lapses, especially in the last several months?
THE PRESIDENT: Can I run the hundred in ten flat? No. But I'm still in good shape.
STEPHANOPOULOS: Are you more frail?
THE PRESIDENT: No.
STEPHANOPOULOS: I know you spoke—
THE PRESIDENT: Come keep my schedule. [laughs]
STEPHANOPOULOS: I know you spoke with your doctor after the debate. What did he say?
THE PRESIDENT: He said, uh he just looked at me. He said, ""You're exhausted."" I said—look, I have medical doctors traveling everywhere--every President does, as you know--medical doctors, some of the best in the world, travel with me everywhere I go. I have an ongoing uh, assessment of what I'm doin'. And they don't hesitate to tell me if they think there's something wrong.
STEPHANOPOULOS: I know you said you have an ongoing assessment. Have you had a full neurological and cognitive evaluation?
THE PRESIDENT: I've had a —I get a full neurological test every day--with me. And I've had a full physical. I had, you know, I mean, I've, I've been at Walter Reed [Hospital] for my physicals. I mean, uh, yes, in answer.
STEPHANOPOULOS: I, I know your doctor said he consulted with a neurologist—I, I guess I'm asking a slightly different question. Have you had the specific cognitive tests and have you had a neurologist, a specialist, do an examination?
THE PRESIDENT: No. No one said I had to. No one said--they said I'm good.
STEPHANOPOULOS: Would you be willing to undergo an independent medical evaluation that included neurological and cogni—cognitive tests and release the results to the American people?
THE PRESIDENT: Look, I have a cognitive test every single day. Every day I have that test. Everything I do. You know, not only am I campaignin', but I'm runnin' the world. And, and that's not hi--sounds like hyperbole. But, we are the essential nation in the world. Madeline Albright was right.
And every single day—for example, today before I come out here, I'm on the phone with the—with the Prime Minister of--I know I shouldn't get into the detail, but with Netanyahu. I'm on the phone with the new Prime Minister of England. I'm workin' on what we were doing with regard to, in Europe, with regard to expansion of NATO and whether it's goin' to stick. I'm takin' on Putin. I mean--every day--there's no day I go through, there are not those decisions I have to make every single day.
STEPHANOPOULOS: And you have been doing that and the American people have been watching. Yet their concerns about your age and your health are growing. So that's why I'm asking could-- To reassure them, would you be willing to have the independent medical evaluation?
THE PRESIDENT: Watch me between--there's a lotta time left in this campaign. It's over 125 days.
STEPHANOPOULOS: So the answer--
THE PRESIDENT: To make [or possibly ""don't make""] the decision.
STEPHANOPOULOS: The right answer right now is ""No. You, you don't want to do that right now.
THE PRESIDENT: No, I've already done it.
STEPHANOPOULOS: You talked a lot about your successes in, at the beginning of this interview and, and I don't wanna dispute that--I don't wanna debate that. But as you know, elections are about the future, not the past. They're about tomorrow, not yesterday. And the question on so many people's minds right now is, can you serve effectively for the next four years?
THE PRESIDENT: George. I'm the guy that put NATO together--the future. No one thought I could expand it. I'm the guy that shut Putin down. No one thought could happen. I'm the guy that put together the South Pacific initiative with AUKUS. I'm the guy that got fifty nations, out--not only in Europe--outside of Europe as well, to help Ukraine. I'm the guy that got Japanese to expand their budget.
I'm the--so I mean, and, the--for example, when I decided--we used to have 40% of the computer chip in--we invented the chip--of those little chips--computer chip. It's in everything from a cell phone to weapons. And so we used to have 40% of, we're down to virtually nothin'. So I get in the plane against the advice of everybody and I fly to South Korea. I convinced them to invest in the United States. Billions of dollars. Now we have tens of billions of dollars bein' invested in the United States, making us back in the position we're gonna own that industry again.
We have, I mean—I, I guess--anyway. I'm not—I don't wanna take too much credit, I have great staff.
STEPHANOPOULOS: But all that—my--I guess my point is all that takes a toll. Do you have the mental and physical capacity to do it for another four years?
THE PRESIDENT: I believe--I wouldn't be runnin' if I didn't think of I did.
Look [pauses]--I'm runnin' again because I think I understand best what has to be done. To take this nation to a completely n-, new level, we're on our way. We're on our way.
And look, the decision recently made by the Supreme Court on immunity. You know, the next President of the United States, it's not just about whether he or she knows what they're doin'.
It's — it's — it's not, not about acon — a conglomerate of people making decisions. It's about the character of the President. The character of the President's gonna determine whether or not this Constitution is employed the right way.
STEPHANOPOULOS: Let me ask you a tougher, more personal question. Are you sure you're being honest with yourself when you say you have the mental and physical capacity to serve another four years?
THE PRESIDENT: Yes, I am. Because George, the last thing I wanna do is not be able to meet that. I think as some of senior economists and senior foreign policy specialists say, if I stop now, I go down in history as a pretty successful President. No one thought I could get done what we got done.
STEPHANOPOULOS: But are you being with, honest with yourself as well about your ability to defeat Donald Trump, right now?
THE PRESIDENT: Yes! Yes, yes, yes.
STEPHANOPOULOS: You say that and let me challenge you—
THE PRESIDENT: Sure.
STEPHANOPOULOS: --because you were close, but behind going into the debate. Uh, you're further behind now by, by any measure. It's been a two-man race for several months. Inflation has come down. In those last few months, he's become a convicted felon. Yet you're still falling further behind.
THE PRESIDENT: You guys keep saying that. George, do you--look, you know polling better than anybody. You think polling data's accurate as it used to be?
STEPHANOPOULOS: I don't think so, but I think when you look at all the polling data right now, it shows that he's certainly ahead in the popular vote, probably ev-, even more ahead in the battleground states. And one of the other key factors there, is it shows that in many of the battleground states, the Democrats who are running for Senate and the House, are doing better than you are.
THE PRESIDENT: Well, that's not unusual in some states. I carried an awful lotta Democrats last time I ran, in 2020. Look, I remember them tellin' me the same thing in 2020. I can't win, the poll show I can't win. Number 2024--2020 the red wave was coming.
Before the vote, I said, ""That's not gonna happen. We're gonna win."" We did better in an off-year than almost any incumbent president ever has done. They said in 2023, all the tough races, we're not gonna win. I went into all those areas and all those, all those districts, and we won.
STEPHANOPOULOS: All that is true, but 2020 was a close race and your approval rating has dropped significantly since then. I think the last poll I saw was about 36%.
THE PRESIDENT: Whoa, whoa, whoa.
STEPHANOPOULOS: The number of Americans who think you're too old to serve has doubled since 2020. Wouldn't a clear-eyed political calculus tell you that it's gonna be much tougher to win in 2024?.
THE PRESIDENT: Not when you're running against a pathological liar. Not when he hadn't been challenged in a way that he's about to be challenged. Not when people--
STEPHANOPOULOS: You've had months to challenge him.
THE PRESIDENT: Oh sure, I had months, but I was also doin' a hell of a lot of other things, like wars around the world, like keeping NATO together, like working--anyway. But look--
STEPHANOPOULOS: Do you really believe you're not behind right now?
THE PRESIDENT: I think it's--all pollsters I talk to tell me it's a toss-up. It's a toss-up. And when I'm behind, there's only one poll I'm really far behind--CBS poll and NBC. I mean, excuse me. And uh—
STEPHANOPOULOS: New York Times and NBC both you have, have you about six points behind in the popular vote.
THE PRESIDENT: That's exactly right. New York Times had me behind before anything having to do with this race and behind behind 10 points, 10 points had me behind. Nothing's changed substantially from the debate in the New York Times poll.
STEPHANOPOULOS: Just--when you look at the reality, though, Mr. President, I mean, ah, you won the popular vote, ah, in 2020, but it was still deadly close in the Electoral College--
THE PRESIDENT: By 7 million votes.
STEPHANOPOULOS: Yes, but you're behind now in the popular vote.
THE PRESIDENT: I don't. I don't buy that.
STEPHANOPOULOS: Is it worth the risk?
THE PRESIDENT: I don't think anybody's more qualified to be President or win this race than me.
STEPHANOPOULOS: You know the heart of your case against Donald Trump--it is that he's only out for himself. Putting his personal interest ahead of the national interest. How do you respond to critics who say that by staying in the race, you're doing the same thing?
THE PRESIDENT: Ohh come on! Well, I don't think those critics know what they're talkin' about.
STEPHANOPOULOS: They're just wrong?
THE PRESIDENT: They're just wrong! Look, Trump is a pathological liar. Trump is—he, he is—[pauses]. Have you ever seen anything Trump did that benefited som, somebody else, not him? I'm, I'm, you can't answer, I know.
STEPHANOPOULOS: I've I've questioned him and his allies as persistently as any journalists has.
THE PRESIDENT: No, I know you have. I'm not being critical. I'm not being critical. But look, I mean. [pauses]
The man is a congenital liar. As I said, they pointed out in that debate, he lied 27-28 times--The Times--or whatever number, over 20 times. Talk about how his good his economy was, how he brought down inflation, and how--this is a guy who, unlike only other president of other'n him is Hoover, lost more jobs than he created.
This's the guy told us to put bleach in our arms to deal with COVID with a million, over a million people died.
This is the guy who talks about wanna get rid of the healthcare provision we put in place. This is the guy who wants to give the power back to Big Pharma to be able to charge exorbitant prices for drugs. This is the guy who wants to undo every single thing I've done, every single, ev, every single thing.
STEPHANOPOULOS: I, I understand that. I understand that's why you want to stay in the race. But have you convinced yourself that only you can defeat him?
THE PRESIDENT: I convinced myself of two things: I'm the most qualified person to beat 'im, and I know how to get things done.
STEPHANOPOULOS: If you can be convinced that you cannot defeat Donald Trump, will you stand down?
THE PRESIDENT: [laughing] Well, it depends on whether the Lord Almighty comes down and tells me that, I might do that.
STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, uh, uh, I mean, on a more practical level, Washington Post just reported it in the last hour that Senator Mark Warner is, is assembling a group of Senators together to try to convince you to stand down because they don't think you can win.
THE PRESIDENT: Well, Mark is a good man. We've never had that--he also tried to get the nomination too. Mark's, not—Mark and I have a different perspective, I respect him.
STEPHANOPOULOS: And if Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries and Nancy Pelosi come down and say, ""We're worried that if you stay in the race, we're gonna lose the House and the Senate,"" how will you respond?
THE PRESIDENT: I, I'd go into detail with 'em, I've speaken to all of 'em in detail, including Jim Clyburn. Every one of 'em. They all said I should stay in the race. Stay in the race. No one said--none of the people said I should leave the race.
STEPHANOPOULOS: But, if they do?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, uh, it's like—[laugh] they're not gonna do that.
STEPHANOPOULOS: You're sure?
THE PRESIDENT: Well, yeah, I'm sure. Look. I mean, if the Lord Almighty came down and said, ""Joe, get outta the race,"" I'd get outta the race. The Lord Almighty's not comin' down. I mean these hypotheticals, George—""if."" I mean if all--
STEPHANOPOULOS: But, but it's, it's, it's not that hypothetical any more. It--I, I, I grant that the, they have not requested the meeting. But it's been reported--
THE PRESIDENT: But, well, they, I've met with them. I've met with a lotta these people. I've talked with them regularly. I had an hour conversation with Hakeem. I had more time than that with Jim Clyburn. I spent time with, many hours, off and on, the last little bit with Chuck Schumer. It's not like--I had all the governors. All the governors.
STEPHANOPOULOS: I agree that the Lord Almighty's not gonna come down, but if—if—if you are told, reliably from your allies, from your friends and supporters in the Democratic Party, in the House and the Senate, that they're concerned you're gonna lose the House and the Senate if you stay in, what will you do?
THE PRESIDENT: I'm not gonna answer that question. It's not gonna happen.
STEPHANOPOULOS: What's your plan to turn the campaign around?
THE PRESIDENT: You saw it today. How many f--how many people can you get--draw crowds like I drew today? You find many more enthusiastic than today? Huh?
STEPHANOPOULOS: I mean I--I don't think you wanna play the crowd game. Donald Trump can draw big crowds. There's no question about that.
THE PRESIDENT: He can draw a big crowd, but what's he saying? Wha? Who, who's he have? I'm the guy supposedly in trouble. We raised $38 million within four days after this. Over, we have over a million individual contributors. Individual contributors. Less, less than 200 bucks. Yeah, I mean. I've not seen what you're, you're proposing.
STEPHANOPOULOS: You haven't seen the, the fall-off in the polls? You haven't seen the reports of discontent in the Democratic Party, House Democrats, Senate Democrats?
THE PRESIDENT: I've seen it from the press.
STEPHANOPOULOS: You know, I've heard from dozens of your supporters over the last few days, and, and a variety of views, I grant you that. But, uh, the prevailing sentiment is this. Uh...
They love you. And they will be forever grateful to you for defeating Donald Trump in 2020. They think you've done a great job as President. A lot of the successes you outlined. But they are worried about you and the country, and they don't think you can win. They want you to go with grace, and they will cheer you if you do. Whadda you say to that?
THE PRESIDENT: I say the vast majority are not with that, where those folks are. I don't doubt there's some folks there. Have you ever seen a group, a, a time when elected officials running for office aren't a little worried? Have you ever seen that? I've not. Same thing happened in 2020. ""Aww, Biden, I don't know, man, what's he gonna do? Uhh, He may bring me down. He may--.""
STEPHANOPOULOS: Mr. President, I've never seen a President 36 percent approval get reelected.
THE PRESIDENT: Well, I don't believe that's my approval rating. That's not what our polls show.
STEPHANOPOULOS: And if you stay in and Trump is elected and everything you're warning about comes to pass, how will you feel in January?
THE PRESIDENT: I'll feel as long as I gave it my all and I did the good as job as I know I can do—that's what this is about. Look, George. Think of it this way. You've heard me say this before. I think the United States and the world is at an inflection point where the things that happen in the next several years are gonna determine what the next six, seven decades'll look like. And who's gonna be able to hold NATO together like me? Who's gonna be able to be in a position where I'm able to keep the Pacific basin in a position where we're we're at least check-mating China now? Who's gonna, who's gonna do that? Who has that reach, who has? Who knows all these pe…? We're gonna have, I guess, a, a good way to judge me is you're gonna have now the NATO conference, here in the United States next week. Come listen. See what they say.
STEPHANOPOULOS: Mr. President, thanks for your time.
THE PRESIDENT: Thank you.

It is critical that the world continues to stand with Ukraine at this important moment and that we not ignore Russian aggression. This week, I will be welcoming President Zelenskyy and NATO leaders to Washington, DC, and I will be meeting with President Zelenskyy to make clear our support for Ukraine is unshakeable. Together with our allies, we will be announcing new measures to strengthen Ukraine's air defenses to help protect their cities and civilians from Russian strikes.

Today, we are announcing that, collectively, we are providing Ukraine with additional strategic air defense systems, including additional Patriot batteries donated by the United States, Germany, and Romania; Patriot components donated by the Netherlands and other partners to enable the operation of an additional Patriot battery; and an additional SAMP-T system donated by Italy. These five strategic air defense systems will help to protect Ukrainian cities, civilians, and soldiers, and we are coordinating closely with the Ukrainian government so that these systems can be utilized rapidly. We are working on a further announcement this year of additional strategic air defense systems for Ukraine.
In addition, in the coming months, the United States and partners intend to provide Ukraine with dozens of tactical air defense systems, including NASAMS, HAWKs, IRIS T-SLM, IRIS T-SLS, and Gepard systems. These systems will further expand and strengthen Ukraine's air defense coverage. Several Allies—including Canada, Norway, Spain, and the United Kingdom—will continue to play an integral role in the provision of these systems, and many other supporters of Ukraine will assist in the provision of interceptors. For its part, the United States will re-sequence planned deliveries of Foreign Military Sales of critical air defense interceptors in coordination with partners so they are delivered to Ukraine, providing Ukraine with hundreds of additional air defense interceptors over the next year.
As we strengthen Ukraine's air defenses, we are grateful to the coalition of more than 50 countries that continues to provide security assistance to Ukraine, as well as to the Immediate Action on Air Defense Initiative—to which partners have pledged more than $1 billion in support of air defense for Ukraine—and the Integrated Air and Missile Defense Capability Coalition, co-led by Germany and France. We also welcome NATO's work to support Ukraine's efforts to develop a NATO-interoperable integrated air and missile defense architecture.

Joe Biden,"July 11, 2024",Joint Statement—President Joe Biden Launches the Ukraine Compact,"Today, President Biden launched the Ukraine Compact at an event with 32 allies and partners as part of our commitment to Ukraine's long term security. This Compact fulfills the promise President Biden and these countries made in Vilnius in 2023 to negotiate long-term bilateral security agreements with Ukraine to support Ukraine as it defends itself now, and to deter aggression against Ukraine in the future as part of its bridge to NATO membership. Leveraging each of our agreements, this historic Compact creates a unified and comprehensive security architecture to support Ukraine today and in the future, in war and in peace. Together, will achieve our collective goal: a Ukraine that is free, sovereign, democratic, independent, and prosperous, and able to defend itself and deter future aggression 
We the leaders of the United States of America, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, together with the President of the European Council, the President of the European Commission, and the President of Ukraine:
Commend the security agreements and arrangements finalized with Ukraine by 20 countries and the European Union (EU) under the framework of the Joint Declaration of Support for Ukraine (Joint Declaration) released on the margins of the 2023 Vilnius North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Summit, and welcome all the remaining Joint Declaration signatories finalizing their respective security agreements and arrangements with Ukraine in the near future;
Affirm that the security of Ukraine is integral to the security of the Euro-Atlantic region and beyond, and that we intend to support Ukraine until it prevails against Russia's aggression;
Emphasize our unwavering commitment to a free, independent, democratic, and sovereign Ukraine capable of defending itself and deterring future aggression, and reaffirm Ukraine's sovereign right to choose its own security arrangements as well as political, social, economic, and cultural systems;
Underscore that Russia's illegal and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine is a threat to international peace and security; a flagrant violation of international law, including the United Nations (UN) Charter; and incompatible with our security interests; and
Recognize Ukraine's commitment to reforms strengthening democracy, the rule of law, and respect for human rights and media freedoms, as needed to advance its Euro-Atlantic aspirations, and emphasize our shared values and interests, including respect for the principles of the UN Charter such as sovereignty and territorial integrity.
Today, we announce the Ukraine Compact (Compact) with a view towards coordinating and accelerating our collective efforts to meet Ukraine's comprehensive security needs, as outlined in the Joint Declaration and in the security agreements and arrangements each of the signatories (Compact Signatories) has completed with Ukraine. Through this Compact, we declare our enduring intent and commitment to ensure Ukraine can successfully defend its freedom, independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity today and deter acts of aggression in the future. To meet these vital objectives, as outlined in our respective bilateral security agreements and arrangements and consistent with all applicable laws and our respective legal systems, Compact Signatories pledge to:
(1) Support Ukraine's immediate defense and security needs, including through the continued provision of security assistance and training, modern military equipment, and defense industrial and necessary economic support, working bilaterally and through existing multilateral mechanisms, including the Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG) and its Capability Coalitions, NATO Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine (NSATU), and the EU Military Assistance Mission in support of Ukraine (EUMAM Ukraine);
(2) Accelerate efforts to build a Ukrainian future force that maintains a credible defense and deterrence capability, including by convening within 6 months at the level of Defense Ministers through the UDCG to review and approve roadmaps prepared by the leaders of the Capability Coalitions—each a Compact Signatory—on future force development through 2027, in coordination with and EUMAM Ukraine, with a view to continue strengthening the force into the 2030s; and
(3) In the event of future Russian armed attack against Ukraine following the conclusion of current hostilities, convene swiftly and collectively at the most senior levels to determine appropriate next steps in supporting Ukraine as it exercises its right of self-defense as enshrined in Article 51 of the UN Charter, including the provision of swift and sustained security assistance and the imposition of economic and other costs on Russia.
We intend to uphold these commitments with unwavering determination by leveraging the multilateral security architecture that supports Ukraine, consistent with our respective national laws and security and defense policies. Compact Signatories plan to take these commitments forward while Ukraine pursues its pathway towards future membership in the EU, NATO, and the broader Euro-Atlantic community. Other countries that wish to contribute to this effort to ensure a free, democratic, independent, and sovereign Ukraine may join this Compact upon completion of a bilateral security agreement or arrangement with Ukraine.

Joe Biden,"August 06, 2024",Statement on the Resignation of United States Special Representative for Ukraine's Economic Recovery Penny S. Pritzker,"Over the past 2½ years, the United States has rallied the world to stand with the people of Ukraine as they defend their freedom against Russia's vicious onslaught. Central to that effort has been Penny Pritzker, our country's first Special Representative for Ukraine's Economic Recovery.
Working with partners at home and abroad, including international financial institutions, Special Representative Pritzker has mobilized significant public and private investment to help Ukraine maintain its economy as it repels Russian forces. She's created a first-of-its-kind model for war risk insurance that has given many companies the confidence to continue doing business in Ukraine. She has worked to reopen critical export markets for Ukrainian businesses. She has strengthened Ukraine's defense industrial base by helping facilitate coproduction ventures with U.S. companies that benefit both our nations. And she has helped the Ukrainian Government make needed economic reforms so as it begins to rebuild, it rebuilds stronger.
Like so many others, I am grateful to Special Representative Pritzker for returning to public service to share her wisdom and expertise. Her legacy of leadership and innovation is one we will carry forward as we continue to help Ukraine forge a more secure future: diplomatically, militarily, and economically.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-the-resignation-united-states-special-representative-for-ukraines-economic
Joe Biden,"August 14, 2024",Statement on Prime Minister Fumio Kishida of Japan's Decision Not To Seek Reelection,"Prime Minister Kishida Fumio's leadership has been nothing short of historic. Since he assumed office nearly 3 years ago, Prime Minister Kishida and I have worked together to take the U.S.-Japan alliance to new heights, from advancing a free and open Indo-Pacific region, to standing side by side as steadfast, global partners. Guided by unflinching courage and moral clarity, Prime Minister Kishida has transformed Japan's role in the world. He unveiled a momentous new national security strategy, surged support to Ukraine after Russia's invasion, and, together with President Yoon of the Republic of Korea, has taken historic steps to usher in a new era of U.S.-R.O.K.-Japan trilateral cooperation, strengthening our collective capacity to take on common challenges.
Prime Minister Kishida took these and other actions not because they were easy, but because he believes to his core that they were the right thing to do. Put simply, thanks to Prime Minister Kishida's leadership, the future of the U.S.-Japan alliance is stronger and brighter than ever. Prime Minister Kishida's courageous leadership will be remembered on both sides of the Pacific for decades to come, and I will always be grateful to call him my friend.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-prime-minister-fumio-kishida-japans-decision-not-seek-reelection
Joe Biden,"August 23, 2024",Statement on Ukraine's Independence Day,"Tomorrow, as the people of Ukraine mark their Independence Day, let it be clear: When Russia's senseless war began, Ukraine was a free country. Today, it is still a free country. And the war will end with Ukraine remaining a free, sovereign, and independent country.
I spoke with President Zelenskyy today to reaffirm this message and to express America's unwavering support for the people of Ukraine. For 2½ years, they have repelled Russia's vicious onslaught, including retaking more than half of the territory Russian forces seized in the initial days of the war. They have remained unbowed in the face of Russia's heinous war crimes and atrocities. And day after day, they have defended the values that unite people across both of our nations and around the world—including independence.
That is why I am proud we will announce a new package of military aid for Ukraine today. The package includes air defense missiles to protect Ukraine's critical infrastructure, counter-drone equipment and anti-armor missiles to defend against Russia's evolving tactics on the battlefield, and ammunition for frontline soldiers and the mobile rocket systems that protect them. We are also imposing new sanctions today on nearly 400 entities and individuals who are enabling Russia's illegal war as part of our enduring commitment to hold Russia accountable for its aggression.
These actions build on a series of historic steps we have taken with our allies and partners over the last few months to support Ukraine, from transferring F-16 fighter jets, to committing to deliver hundreds of air defense interceptors over the next year, to quickly surging security assistance to the frontlines following the passing of our national security bill. Last month, I also brought together 20 nations who have signed bilateral security agreements with Ukraine to form the Ukraine Compact, which will strengthen Ukraine's ability to defend itself now and in the future. And, together with the G-7, we are taking unprecedented action to make Russia pay for damage it's caused by issuing $50 billion in loans backed by the profits of frozen Russian sovereign assets.
Make no mistake: Russia will not prevail in this conflict. The independent people of Ukraine will prevail, and the United States, our allies, and our partners, will continue to stand with them every step of the way.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-ukraines-independence-day-1
Joe Biden,"August 26, 2024",Statement on Russia's Aerial Assault on Ukraine's Energy Grid,"Earlier today Russia launched waves of missiles and drones against Ukrainian cities and energy infrastructure. Ukrainian officials report that this outrageous attack resulted in the deaths of Ukrainian civilians and targeted more than two dozen critical energy sites. I condemn, in the strongest possible terms, Russia's continued war against Ukraine and its efforts to plunge the Ukrainian people into darkness. Let me be clear: Russia will never succeed in Ukraine, and the spirit of the Ukrainian people will never be broken.
The United States will continue to lead a coalition of more than 50 countries in support of Ukraine. This coalition is providing Ukraine with critically needed military equipment, including air defense systems and interceptors. As I announced at the NATO summit in July, the United States and our allies have provided Ukraine with the equipment for five additional strategic air defense systems, and I have reprioritized U.S. air defense exports so they are sent to Ukraine first. The United States also is surging energy equipment to Ukraine to repair its systems and strengthen the resilience of Ukraine's energy grid.
As I told President Zelenskyy on August 23, U.S. support for Ukraine is unshakable. Since February 2022, the people of Ukraine have courageously defended against Russia's invasion, retaking more than half the territory Russian forces seized in the initial days of the war. Ukraine remains a free, sovereign, and independent nation, and Ukrainian forces are fighting every day to defend their homeland and their freedom. The United States will stand with the people of Ukraine until they prevail.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-russias-aerial-assault-ukraines-energy-grid
Joe Biden,"September 03, 2024","Statement on the Russian Attack on Poltava, Ukraine","Earlier today Russian missiles struck a military training facility and a hospital in Ukraine, killing more than 50 people and injuring dozens more. I condemn this deplorable attack in the strongest possible terms.
This assault is a tragic reminder of Putin's ongoing and outrageous attempts to break the will of a free people. But for 2½ years, the people of Ukraine have stood unbowed. And the United States will continue stand with them, including providing the air defense systems and capabilities they need to protect their country.
Make no mistake: Russia will not prevail in this war. The people of Ukraine will prevail. And on this tragic day, and every day, the United States stands with them.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-the-russian-attack-poltava-ukraine
Joe Biden,"September 21, 2024","Joint Statement by President Biden, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of Australia, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida of Japan, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India—The Wilmington Declaration","Today, we—Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of Australia, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, Prime Minister Kishida Fumio of Japan, and President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. of the United States—met for the fourth in-person Quad Leaders Summit, hosted by President Biden in Wilmington, Delaware.
Four years since elevating the Quad to a leader-level format, the Quad is more strategically aligned than ever before and is a force for good that delivers real, positive, and enduring impact for the Indo-Pacific. We celebrate the fact that over just four years, Quad countries have built a vital and enduring regional grouping that will buttress the Indo-Pacific for decades to come.
Anchored by shared values, we seek to uphold the international order based on the rule of law. Together we represent nearly two billion people and over one-third of global gross domestic product. We reaffirm our steadfast commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific that is inclusive and resilient. Through our cooperation, the Quad is harnessing all of our collective strengths and resources, from governments to the private sector to people-to-people relationships, to support the region's sustainable development, stability, and prosperity by delivering tangible benefits to the people of the Indo-Pacific.
As four leading maritime democracies in the Indo-Pacific, we unequivocally stand for the maintenance of peace and stability across this dynamic region, as an indispensable element of global security and prosperity. We strongly oppose any destabilizing or unilateral actions that seek to change the status quo by force or coercion. We condemn recent illicit missile launches in the region that violate UN Security Council resolutions. We express serious concern over recent dangerous and aggressive actions in the maritime domain. We seek a region where no country dominates and no country is dominated—one where all countries are free from coercion, and can exercise their agency to determine their futures. We are united in our commitment to upholding a stable and open international system, with its strong support for human rights, the principle of freedom, rule of law, democratic values, sovereignty and territorial integrity, and peaceful settlement of disputes and prohibition on the threat or use of force in accordance with international law, including the UN Charter.
Reflecting the Vision Statement issued by Leaders at the 2023 Quad Summit, we are and will continue to be transparent in what we do. Respect for the leadership of regional institutions, including the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF), and the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA), is and will remain at the center of the Quad's efforts.
A Global Force for Good 
Health Security 
The COVID-19 pandemic reminded the world how important health security is to our societies, our economies, and the stability of our region. In 2021 and 2022, the Quad came together to deliver more than 400 million safe and effective COVID-19 doses to Indo-Pacific countries and almost 800 million vaccines globally, and provided $5.6 billion to the COVAX Advance Market Commitment for vaccine supply to low and middle-income countries. In 2023, we announced the Quad Health Security Partnership, through which the Quad continues to deliver for partners across the region, including through the delivery of pandemic preparedness training.
In response to the current clade I mpox outbreak, as well as the ongoing clade II mpox outbreak, we plan to coordinate our efforts to promote equitable access to safe, effective, quality-assured mpox vaccines, including where appropriate expanding vaccine manufacturing in low and middle-income countries.
Today we are proud to announce the Quad Cancer Moonshot, a groundbreaking partnership to save lives in the Indo-Pacific region. Building on the Quad's successful partnership during the COVID-19 pandemic, our collective investments to address cancer in the region, our scientific and medical capabilities, and contributions from our private and non-profit sectors, we will collaborate with partner nations to reduce the burden of cancer in the region.
The Quad Cancer Moonshot will focus initially on combatting cervical cancer—a preventable cancer that continues to claim too many lives—in the Indo-Pacific region, while laying the groundwork to address other forms of cancer as well. The United States intends to support this initiative, including through U.S. Navy medical trainings and professional exchanges around cervical cancer prevention in the region starting in 2025, and through U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) openness to finance eligible private sector-driven projects to prevent, diagnose, and treat cancer, including cervical cancer. Australia is announcing the expansion of the Elimination Partnership in the Indo-Pacific for Cervical Cancer Program (EPICC) with support of the Australian Government and the Minderoo Foundation to AUD 29.6 million, to cover up to eleven countries in the Indo-Pacific in helping advance the elimination of cervical cancer and support complementary initiatives focused on cancer prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. India commits to providing HPV sampling kits, detection kits, and cervical cancer vaccines worth $7.5 million to the Indo-Pacific region. India, through its $10 million commitment to the WHO's Global Initiative on Digital Health, will offer technical assistance to interested countries in the Indo-Pacific region for the adoption and deployment of its Digital Public Infrastructure that helps in cancer screening and care. Japan is providing medical equipment, including CT and MRI scanners, and other assistance worth approximately $27 million, including in Cambodia, Vietnam, and Timor-Leste, and is contributing to international organizations such as the Gavi Vaccine Alliance. Quad partners also intend to work, within respective national contexts, to collaborate in advancing research and development in the area of cancer and to increase private sector and non-governmental sector activities in support of reducing the burden of cervical cancer in the region. We welcome a number of new, ambitious commitments from non-governmental institutions, including the Serum Institute of India, in partnership with Gavi, which will support orders of up to 40 million HPV vaccine doses, subject to necessary approvals, for the Indo-Pacific region, and which may be increased consistent with demand. We also welcome a new $100 million commitment from Women's Health and Empowerment Network to address cervical cancer in Southeast Asia.
Altogether, our scientific experts assess that the Quad Cancer Moonshot will save hundreds of thousands of lives over the coming decades.
Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) 
Twenty years since the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, when the Quad first came together to surge humanitarian assistance, we continue to respond to the vulnerabilities caused by natural disasters in the Indo-Pacific. In 2022, the Quad established the ""Quad Partnership on Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief in the Indo-Pacific"" and signed Guidelines for the Quad Partnership on HADR in the Indo-Pacific, which enable Quad countries to rapidly coordinate in the face of natural disasters. We welcome Quad governments working to ensure readiness to rapidly respond, including through pre-positioning of essential relief supplies, in the event of a natural disaster; this effort extends from the Indian Ocean region, to Southeast Asia, to the Pacific.
In May 2024, following a tragic landslide in Papua New Guinea, Quad partners collectively contributed over $5 million in humanitarian assistance. Quad partners are working together to provide over $4 million in humanitarian assistance to support the people of Vietnam in light of the devastating consequences of Typhoon Yagi. The Quad continues to support partners in the region in their longer-term resiliency efforts.
Maritime Security 
In 2022, we announced the Indo-Pacific Partnership for Maritime Domain Awareness (IPMDA) to offer near-real-time, integrated, and cost-effective maritime domain awareness information to partners in the region. Since then, in consultation with partners, we have successfully scaled the program across the Indo-Pacific region—through the Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency, with partners in Southeast Asia, to the Information Fusion Center—Indian Ocean Region, Gurugram. In doing so, the Quad has helped well over two dozen countries access dark vessel maritime domain awareness data, so they can better monitor the activities in their exclusive economic zones—including unlawful activity. Australia commits to boosting its cooperation with the Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency to enhance regional maritime domain awareness in the Pacific through satellite data, training, and capacity building.
Today we are announcing a new regional Maritime Initiative for Training in the Indo-Pacific (MAITRI), to enable our partners in the region to maximize tools provided through IPMDA and other Quad partner initiatives, to monitor and secure their waters, enforce their laws, and deter unlawful behavior. We look forward to India hosting the inaugural MAITRI workshop in 2025. Furthermore, we welcome the launch of a Quad maritime legal dialogue to support efforts to uphold the rules-based maritime order in the Indo-Pacific. In addition, Quad partners intend to layer new technology and data into IPMDA over the coming year, to continue to deliver cutting edge capability and information to the region.
We are also announcing today that the U.S. Coast Guard, Japan Coast Guard, Australian Border Force, and Indian Coast Guard, plan to launch a first-ever Quad-at-Sea Ship Observer Mission in 2025, to improve interoperability and advance maritime safety, and continuing with further missions in future years across the Indo-Pacific.
We also announce today the launch of a Quad Indo-Pacific Logistics Network pilot project, to pursue shared airlift capacity among our nations and leverage our collective logistics strengths, in order to support civilian response to natural disasters more rapidly and efficiently across the Indo-Pacific region.
Quality Infrastructure 
The Quad remains committed to improving the region's connectivity through the development of quality, resilient infrastructure.
We are pleased to announce the Quad Ports of the Future Partnership, which will harness the Quad's expertise to support sustainable and resilient port infrastructure development across the Indo-Pacific, in collaboration with regional partners. In 2025, we intend to hold a Quad Regional Ports and Transportation Conference, hosted by India in Mumbai. Through this new partnership, Quad partners intend to coordinate, exchange information, share best practices with partners in the region, and leverage resources to mobilize government and private sector investments in quality port infrastructure across the Indo-Pacific region.
We applaud the expansion of the Quad Infrastructure Fellowships to more than 2,200 experts, and note that Quad partners have already provided well over 1,300 fellowships since the initiative was announced at last year's Summit. We also appreciate the workshop organized by the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure in India, working to empower partners across the Indo-Pacific to strengthen power sector resilience.
Through the Quad Partnership for Cable Connectivity and Resilience, we continue to support and strengthen quality undersea cable networks in the Indo-Pacific, the capacity, durability, and reliability of which are inextricably linked to the security and prosperity of the region and the world. In support of these efforts, Australia launched the Cable Connectivity and Resilience Centre in July, which is delivering workshops and policy and regulatory assistance in response to requests from across the region. Japan will extend technical cooperation to improve public ICT infrastructure management capacity for an undersea cable in Nauru and Kiribati. The United States has conducted over 1,300 capacity building trainings for telecommunication officials and executives from 25 countries in the Indo-Pacific; today the U.S. announces its intent, working with Congress, to invest an additional $3.4 million to extend and expand this training program.
Investments in cable projects by Quad partners will help support all Pacific island countries in achieving primary telecommunication cable connectivity by the end of 2025. Since the last Quad Leaders' Summit, Quad partners have committed over $140 million to undersea cable builds in the Pacific, alongside contributions from other likeminded partners. Complementing these investments in new undersea cables, India has commissioned a feasibility study to examine expansion of undersea cable maintenance and repair capabilities in the Indo-Pacific.
We reaffirm our support for the Pacific Quality Infrastructure Principles, which are an expression of Pacific voices on infrastructure.
We underscore our commitment to an inclusive, open, sustainable, fair, safe, reliable and secure digital future to advance our shared prosperity and sustainable development across the Indo-Pacific. In this context, we welcome the Quad Principles for Development and Deployment of Digital Public Infrastructure.
Critical and Emerging Technologies 
Today, we are proud to announce an ambitious expansion of our partnership to deliver trusted technology solutions to the broader Indo-Pacific region.
Last year, Quad partners launched a landmark initiative to deploy the first Open Radio Access Network (RAN) in the Pacific, in Palau, to support a secure, resilient, and interconnected telecommunications ecosystem. Since then, the Quad has pledged approximately $20 million to this effort.
Quad partners also welcome the opportunity to explore additional Open RAN projects in Southeast Asia. We plan to expand support for ongoing Open RAN field trials and the Asia Open RAN Academy (AORA) in the Philippines, building on the initial $8 million in support that the United States and Japan pledged earlier this year. The United States also plans to invest over $7 million to support the global expansion of AORA, including through establishing a first-of-its-kind Open RAN workforce training initiative at scale in South Asia, in partnership with Indian institutions.
Quad partners will also explore collaborating with the Tuvalu Telecommunications Corporation to ensure the country's readiness for nationwide 5G deployment.
We remain committed to advancing our cooperation on semiconductors through better leveraging of our complementary strengths to realize a diversified and competitive market and enhance resilience of Quad's semiconductor supply chains. We welcome a Memorandum of Cooperation between Quad countries for the Semiconductor Supply Chains Contingency Network.
Through the Advancing Innovations for Empowering NextGen Agriculture (AI-ENGAGE) initiative announced at last year's Summit, our governments are deepening leading-edge collaborative research to harness artificial intelligence, robotics, and sensing to transform agricultural approaches and empower farmers across the Indo-Pacific. We are pleased to announce an inaugural $7.5+ million in funding opportunities for joint research, and welcome the recent signing of a Memorandum of Cooperation between our science agencies to connect our research communities and advance shared research principles.
The United States, Australia, India, and Japan look forward to launching the Quad BioExplore Initiative—a funded mechanism that will support joint AI-driven exploration of diverse non-human biological data across all four countries.
This project will also be underpinned by the forthcoming Quad Principles for Research and Development Collaborations in Critical and Emerging Technologies.
Climate and Clean Energy 
As we underscore the severe economic, social, and environmental consequences posed by the climate crisis, we continue to work together with Indo-Pacific partners, including through Quad Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation Package (Q-CHAMP), to enhance climate and clean energy cooperation as well as promote adaptation and resilience. We emphasize the significant benefits of transitioning to a clean energy economy for our people, our planet, and our shared prosperity. Our countries intend to strengthen our cooperation to align policies, incentives, standards, and investments around creating high-quality, diversified clean energy supply chains that will enhance our collective energy security, create new economic opportunities across the region, and benefit local workers and communities around the world, particularly across the Indo-Pacific.
We will work together, through policy and public finance, to operationalize our commitment to catalyzing complementary and high-standard private sector investment in allied and partner clean energy supply chains. To this end, Australia will open applications for the Quad Clean Energy Supply Chains Diversification Program in November, providing AUD 50 million to support projects that develop and diversify solar panel, hydrogen electrolyzer and battery supply chains in the Indo-Pacific. India commits to invest $2 million in new solar projects in Fiji, Comoros, Madagascar, and Seychelles. Japan has committed to $122 million grants and loans in renewable energy projects in Indo-Pacific countries. The United States, through DFC, will continue to seek opportunities to mobilize private capital to solar, as well as wind, cooling, batteries, and critical minerals to expand and diversify supply chains.
We are pleased to announce a focused Quad effort to boost energy efficiency, including the deployment and manufacturing of high-efficiency affordable, cooling systems to enable climate-vulnerable communities to adapt to rising temperatures while simultaneously reducing strain on the electricity grid.
We jointly affirm our commitment to addressing the challenges posed by climate change and ensure the resilience and sustainability of port infrastructure. Quad partners will leverage our learning and expertise to forge a path towards sustainable and resilient port infrastructure, including through the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI).
Cyber 
In the face of a deteriorating security environment in the cyber domain, Quad countries intend to enhance our cybersecurity partnership to address common threats posed by state-sponsored actors, cybercriminals, and other non-state malicious actors. Our countries commit to taking concrete steps to increase our collective network defense and advance technical capabilities through greater threat information sharing and capacity building. We plan to coordinate joint efforts to identify vulnerabilities, protect national security networks and critical infrastructure networks, and coordinate more closely including on policy responses to significant cybersecurity incidents affecting the Quad's shared priorities.
Quad countries are also partnering with software manufacturers, industry trade groups, and research centers to expand our commitment to pursuing secure software development standards and certification, as endorsed in the Quad's 2023 Secure Software Joint Principles. We will work to harmonize these standards to not only ensure that the development, procurement, and end-use of software for government networks is more secure, but that the cyber resilience of our supply chains, digital economies, and societies are collectively improved. Throughout this fall, Quad countries each plan to host campaigns to mark the annual Quad Cyber Challenge promoting responsible cyber ecosystems, public resources, and cybersecurity awareness. We are constructively engaging on the Quad Action Plan to Protect Commercial Undersea Telecommunications Cables, developed by the Quad Senior Cyber Group, as a complementary effort to the Quad Partnership for Cable Connectivity and Resilience. Our coordinated actions to protect global telecommunications infrastructure as guided by the Action Plan will advance our shared vision for future digital connectivity, global commerce, and prosperity.
Space 
We recognize the essential contribution of space-related applications and technologies in the Indo-Pacific. Our four countries intend to continue delivering Earth Observation data and other space-related applications to assist nations across the Indo-Pacific to strengthen climate early warning systems and better manage the impacts of extreme weather events. In this context, we welcome India's establishment of a space-based web portal for Mauritius, to support the concept of open science for space-based monitoring of extreme weather events and climate impact.

The Government of Japan is supporting the program to enable Quad Fellows to study in Japan. The Quad welcomes the generous support of private sector partners for the next cohort of fellows, including Google, the Pratt Foundation, and Western Digital.
India is pleased to announce a new initiative to award fifty Quad scholarships, worth $500,000, to students from the Indo-Pacific to pursue a 4-year undergraduate engineering program at a Government of India-funded technical institution.
Working Together to Address Regional and Global Issues
Today we reaffirm our consistent and unwavering support for ASEAN centrality and unity. We continue to support implementation of the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific (AOIP) and are committed to ensuring the Quad's work is aligned with ASEAN's principles and priorities.
We underscore ASEAN's regional leadership role, including in the East Asia Summit, the region's premier leader-led forum for strategic dialogue, and the ASEAN Regional Forum. As comprehensive strategic partners of ASEAN, our four countries intend to continue to strengthen our respective relationships with ASEAN and seek opportunities for greater Quad collaboration in support of the AOIP.
We recommit to working in partnership with Pacific island countries to achieve shared aspirations and address shared challenges. We reaffirm our support for Pacific regional institutions that have served the region well over many years, with the PIF as the region's premier political and economic policy organization, and warmly welcome Tonga's leadership as the current PIF Chair in 2024-2025. We continue to support the objectives of the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent. We and our governments will continue to listen to and be guided at every step by Pacific priorities, including climate action, ocean health, resilient infrastructure, maritime security and financial integrity. In particular, we acknowledge climate change remains the single greatest threat to the livelihoods, security and wellbeing of the peoples of the Pacific and applaud Pacific island countries' global leadership on climate action.
We remain committed to strengthening cooperation in the Indian Ocean region. We strongly support IORA as the Indian Ocean region's premier forum for addressing the region's challenges. We recognize India's leadership in finalizing the IORA Outlook on the Indo-Pacific (IOIP) and express our support for its implementation. We thank Sri Lanka for its continued leadership as IORA Chair through this year and look forward to India's assuming the IORA Chair in 2025.
As Leaders, we are steadfast in our conviction that international law, including respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, and the maintenance of peace, safety, security and stability in the maritime domain, underpin the sustainable development, and prosperity of the Indo-Pacific. We emphasize the importance of adherence to international law, particularly as reflected in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), to address challenges to the global maritime rules-based order, including with respect to maritime claims. We are seriously concerned about the situation in the East and South China Seas. We continue to express our serious concern about the militarization of disputed features, and coercive and intimidating maneuvers in the South China Sea. We condemn the dangerous use of coast guard and maritime militia vessels, including increasing use of dangerous maneuvers. We also oppose efforts to disrupt other countries' offshore resource exploitation activities. We reaffirm that maritime disputes must be resolved peacefully and in accordance with international law, as reflected in UNCLOS. We re-emphasize the importance of maintaining and upholding freedom of navigation and overflight, other lawful uses of the sea, and unimpeded commerce consistent with international law. We re-emphasize the universal and unified character of UNCLOS and reaffirm that UNCLOS sets out the legal framework within which all activities in the oceans and the seas must be carried out. We underscore that the 2016 Arbitral Award on the South China Sea is a significant milestone and the basis for peacefully resolving disputes between the parties.
Together, with our global and regional partners, we continue to support international institutions and initiatives that underpin global peace, prosperity and sustainable development. We reiterate our unwavering support for the UN Charter and the three pillars of the UN system. In consultation with our partners, we will work collectively to address attempts to unilaterally undermine the integrity of the UN, its Charter, and its agencies. We will reform the UN Security Council, recognizing the urgent need to make it more representative, inclusive, transparent, efficient, effective, democratic and accountable through expansion in permanent and non-permanent categories of membership of the UN Security Council. This expansion of permanent seats should include representation for Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean in a reformed Security Council.
We stand for adherence to international law and respect for principles of the UN Charter, including territorial integrity, sovereignty of all states, and peaceful resolution of disputes. We express our deepest concern over the war raging in Ukraine including the terrible and tragic humanitarian consequences. Each of us has visited Ukraine since the war began, and seen this first-hand; we reiterate the need for a comprehensive, just, and lasting peace in line with international law, consistent with the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, including respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity. We also note the negative impacts of the war in Ukraine with regard to global food and energy security, especially for developing and least developed countries. In the context of this war, we share the view that the use, or threat of use, of nuclear weapons is unacceptable. We underscore the importance of upholding international law, and in line with the UN Charter, reiterate that all states must refrain from the threat of or use of force against the territorial integrity and sovereignty or political independence of any state.
We condemn North Korea's destabilizing ballistic missile launches and its continued pursuit of nuclear weapons in violation of multiple UN Security Council resolutions (UNSCRs). These launches pose a grave threat to international peace and stability. We urge North Korea to abide by all its obligations under the UNSCRs, refrain from further provocations and engage in substantive dialogue. We reaffirm our commitment to the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula consistent with relevant UNSCRs and call on all countries to fully implement these UNSCRs. We stress the need to prevent any proliferation of nuclear and missile technologies related to North Korea in the region and beyond. We express our grave concern over North Korea's use of proliferation networks, malicious cyber activity and workers abroad to fund its unlawful weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs. In that context, we urge all UN Member States to abide by the relevant UNSCRs including the prohibition on the transfer to North Korea or procurement from North Korea of all arms and related materiel. We express deep concern about countries that are deepening military cooperation with North Korea, which directly undermines the global nonproliferation regime. As the mandate of the UN Panel of Experts tasked with monitoring violations of North Korea-related UNSCR sanctions was not renewed, we reiterate our commitment to continued implementation of the relevant UNSCRs which remain in full force. We reconfirm the necessity of immediate resolution of the abductions issue.
We remain deeply concerned by the worsening political, security and humanitarian situation in Myanmar, including in Rakhine State, and again call for an immediate cessation of violence, the release of all those unjustly and arbitrarily detained, safe and unhindered humanitarian access, resolution of the crisis through constructive and inclusive dialogue among all stakeholders, and a return to the path of inclusive democracy. We reaffirm our strong support for ASEAN-led efforts, including the work of the ASEAN Chair and the Special Envoy of the ASEAN Chair on Myanmar. We call for full implementation of all commitments under the ASEAN Five-Point Consensus. The ongoing conflict and instability have serious implications for the region, including increases in transnational crime such as cybercrime, the illegal drug trade, and human trafficking. We restate our appeal to all States to prevent the flow of arms and dual-use material, including jet fuel. We remain resolute in our support for the people of Myanmar and commit to continuing to work with all stakeholders in a pragmatic and constructive way, to find a sustainable solution to the crisis in a process which is led by the people of Myanmar and returns Myanmar to the path of democracy.
We call upon all States to contribute to the safe, peaceful, responsible, and sustainable use of outer space. We remain committed to fostering international cooperation and transparency, as well as confidence-building measures with the goal of improving the security of outer space for all States. We reaffirm the importance of upholding the existing international legal framework for outer space activities, including the Outer Space Treaty, and the obligation of all States Parties to the Treaty not to place in orbit around the Earth any objects carrying nuclear weapons or any other kinds of weapons of mass destruction, install such weapons on celestial bodies, or station such weapons in outer space in any other manner.
The Quad reaffirms its commitment to fostering a resilient information environment including through its Countering Disinformation Working Group by supporting media freedom and addressing foreign information manipulation and interference, including disinformation, which undermines trust and sows discord in the international community. We recognize these tactics are intended to interfere with domestic and international interests, and we are committed, together with our regional partners, to leverage our collective expertise and capacity to respond. We reaffirm our commitment to respect international human rights law, strengthen civil society, support media freedom, address online harassment and abuse, including technology-facilitated gender-based violence, and counter unethical practices.
We unequivocally condemn terrorism and violent extremism in all its forms and manifestations, including cross-border terrorism. We are committed to international cooperation and will work with our regional partners in a comprehensive and sustained manner to strengthen their capability to prevent, detect and respond to threats posed by terrorism and violent extremism, including threats posed by the use of new and emerging technologies for terrorist purposes, consistent with international law. We are committed to working together to promote accountability for the perpetrators of such terrorist attacks. We reiterate our condemnation of terrorist attacks including the 26/11 attacks in Mumbai and in Pathankot, and our commitment to pursuing designations, as appropriate, by the UN Security Council 1267 Sanctions Committee. We welcome the constructive discussions held at the first Quad Working Group on Counter-Terrorism and the fourth tabletop exercise in Honolulu last year, and look forward to Japan hosting the next meeting and tabletop exercise in November 2024.
We share great interest in achieving peace and stability in the Middle East. We unequivocally condemn the terror attacks on October 7, 2023. The large-scale loss of civilian lives and the humanitarian crisis in Gaza is unacceptable. We affirm the imperative of securing the release of all hostages held by Hamas, and emphasize that the deal to release hostages would bring an immediate and prolonged ceasefire in Gaza. We underscore the urgent need to significantly increase deliveries of life-saving humanitarian assistance throughout Gaza as well as the crucial need to prevent regional escalation. We urge all parties to comply with international law, including international humanitarian law, as applicable. We welcome UNSCR S/RES/2735 (2024), and strongly urge all parties concerned to work immediately and steadily toward the release of all hostages and an immediate ceasefire. We call on all parties to take every feasible step to protect the lives of civilians including aid workers, and facilitate the rapid, safe and unimpeded humanitarian relief to civilians. We also encourage other countries, including those in the Indo-Pacific, to increase their support in order to address the dire humanitarian need on the ground. We underscore that the future recovery and reconstruction of Gaza should be supported by the international community. We remain committed to a sovereign, viable and independent Palestinian state taking into account Israel's legitimate security concerns as part of a two-state solution that enables both Israelis and Palestinians to live in a just, lasting, and secure peace. Any unilateral actions that undermine the prospect of a two-state solution, including Israeli expansion of settlements and violent extremism on all sides, must end. We underscore the need to prevent the conflict from escalating and spilling over in the region.
We condemn the ongoing attacks perpetrated by the Houthis and their supporters against international and commercial vessels transiting through the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, which are destabilizing the region and impeding navigational rights and freedoms and trade flows, and jeopardize the safety of vessels and people on board including sailors.
We reaffirm our commitment to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the achievement of its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We underscore the importance of achieving the SDGs in a comprehensive manner without selectively prioritizing a narrow set of such goals, and reaffirm that the UN has a central role in supporting countries in their implementation. With six years left, we remain steadfast in our commitment to the full implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and accelerating progress toward all the SDGs in a comprehensive manner that is balanced across three dimensions—economic, social and environmental. From global health to sustainable development and climate change, the global community benefits when all stakeholders have the opportunity to contribute to addressing these challenges. We affirm our commitment to contributing to and implementing the Women, Peace and Security (WPS) Agenda and to achieving gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls. We underscore our commitment to strongly engaging constructively in the discussion on advancing sustainable development, including at the Summit of the Future. The Quad continues to realize a safe and secure world where human rights and human dignity are protected, based on the central premise of the SDGs: ""Leave no one behind.""
We, the Quad Leaders, remain dedicated to working in partnership with Indo-Pacific countries in deciding our future and shaping the region we all want to live in.
Enduring Partners for the Indo-Pacific 
Over the past four years, Quad Leaders have met together six times, including twice virtually, and Quad Foreign Ministers have met eight times in the last five years. Quad country representatives meet together on a regular basis, at all levels, including among ambassadors across the four countries' extensive diplomatic networks, to consult one another, exchange ideas to advance shared priorities, and deliver benefits with and for partners across the Indo-Pacific region.

Joe Biden,"September 25, 2024",Joint Statement by Group of Seven (G-7) Nations Leaders—Joint Declaration of Support for Recovery and Reconstruction of Ukraine,"We, the Leaders of the Group of Seven (G7), reaffirm our unwavering support for Ukraine today and in the future, in war and in peace. As stated in the Apulia-G7 Leaders' Communiqué, together with international partners, we remain determined to provide military, budget, humanitarian, and reconstruction support to Ukraine and its people and are strongly committed to helping Ukraine meet its urgent short-term financing needs and to assisting with Ukraine's long-term recovery and reconstruction.
We dispel any false notion that time is on Russia's side or that Russia can prevail by causing Ukraine to fail economically. Russia's war of aggression has wrought tremendous damage upon Ukrainian cities and infrastructure. Today, we reaffirm a series of commitments to counter its effects.
First, Russia's responsibility under international law to pay for the damage it is causing is clear. We reaffirm that, consistent with all applicable laws and our respective legal systems, Russia's sovereign assets in our jurisdictions will remain immobilized until Russia ends its aggression and pays for the damage it has caused to Ukraine.
Second, we commit to use our economic assistance to ensure Ukraine maintains macro-financial stability, to repair and build critical infrastructure including in the energy sector, to boost economic growth, to support social resilience as well as the implementation of priority reforms. These include improving the business climate, strengthening anti-corruption efforts, implementing the justice system reform and promoting of the rule of law within the context of the EU accession process. We will also support Ukraine to ensure rapid and transparent absorption of donor financing.
Third we are continuing our joint work to implement the decision made at the G7 Summit in Apulia to launch Extraordinary Revenue Acceleration (ERA) Loans for Ukraine by the end of the year, in order to make available approximately USD 50 billion in additional funding to Ukraine. The loans will be serviced and repaid by the future flows of extraordinary revenues stemming from the immobilization of Russian sovereign assets held in the European Union and other relevant jurisdictions. Part of these funds will be directed to military assistance to Ukraine. We will maintain solidarity in our commitment to providing this support to Ukraine.
Fourth, we will continue to pursue our vision also by strategizing, coordinating and steering our support for Ukraine's economic recovery and reconstruction through the Ukraine Donor Platform. This will include catalyzing private sector contributions as well as leveraging bilateral, European Union, and international financial institution funding, and encouraging Ukraine's reform agenda in view of the country's accession path to the EU. We will continue to support Ukraine's human capital through our ongoing response to humanitarian needs and social protection.
Finally, we will continue to assess and monitor progress on these commitments through Ukraine Donor Platform meetings and the annual Ukraine Recovery Conference, the next edition of which will be hosted by Italy in 2025.
In order to implement the above-mentioned commitments, we will each work to provide Ukraine with specific, bilateral support aligned with this joint declaration and with the bilateral security agreements and arrangements that have been negotiated and signed with Ukraine.
For its part, Ukraine is committed to implementing its economic, judiciary, anti-corruption, corporate governance, defense, public administration, public investment management and law enforcement reforms. These reforms are necessary and will be vital to enabling long-term support for Ukrainian reconstruction and recovery.
Our message is clear: we remain committed to the strategic objective of a free, independent, democratic and sovereign Ukraine, within its internationally recognized borders, that is prosperous and able to defend itself. We highlight the importance of an inclusive and gender-responsive recovery and the need to address the different needs of women, children and disabled persons as well as other population groups who have been disproportionately affected by Russia's war of aggression. Through our collective support for Ukrainian reconstruction and recovery, we will ensure that Russia fails in its objectives to subjugate Ukraine—and that Ukraine emerges from Russia's war of aggression with a modernized, vibrant, inclusive society and innovative economy, resilient to Russian threats. Other countries that wish to contribute to this effort in support of Ukraine's long-term reconstruction and recovery may join this Joint Declaration at any time.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/joint-statement-group-seven-g-7-nations-leaders-joint-declaration-support-for-recovery-and
Joe Biden,"September 26, 2024",Statement on United States Assistance to Ukraine,"I am proud to welcome President Zelenskyy back to the White House today. For nearly 3 years, the United States has rallied the world to stand with the people of Ukraine as they defend their freedom from Russian aggression, and it has been a top priority of my administration to provide Ukraine with the support it needs to prevail. In that time, Ukraine has won the battle of Kyiv, reclaimed more than half the territory that Russia seized at the start of the war, and safeguarded its sovereignty and independence. But there is more work to do. That is why, today, I am announcing a surge in security assistance for Ukraine and a series of additional actions to help Ukraine win this war.
Today I am announcing that:
I have directed the Department of Defense to allocate all of its remaining security assistance funding that has been appropriated for Ukraine by the end of my term in office. As part of this effort, the Department of Defense will allocate the remaining Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative funds by the end of this year. I also have authorized $5.5 billion in Presidential drawdown authority to ensure this authority does not expire, so that my administration can fully utilize the funding appropriated by Congress to support the drawdown of U.S. equipment for Ukraine and then replenish U.S. stockpiles.
The Department of Defense is announcing $2.4 billion in security assistance through the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, which will provide Ukraine with additional air defense, Unmanned Aerial Systems, and air-to-ground munitions, as well as strengthen Ukraine's defense industrial base and support its maintenance and sustainment requirements.
To enhance Ukraine's long-range strike capabilities, I have decided to provide Ukraine with the Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW) long-range munition.
To further strengthen Ukraine's air defenses, I have directed the Department of Defense to refurbish and provide Ukraine with an additional Patriot air defense battery and to provide Ukraine with additional Patriot missiles. This builds on my decision earlier this year to divert U.S. air defense exports to Ukraine, which will provide Ukraine with hundreds of additional Patriot and AMRAAM missiles over the next year and will help Ukraine defend its cities and its people.
To build the capacity of Ukraine's air force, I have directed the Department of Defense to expand training for Ukrainian F-16 pilots, including by supporting the training of an additional 18 pilots next year.
To counter Russian sanctions evasion and money laundering, the Department of Justice, the Department of the Treasury, and the U.S. Secret Service have taken action today to disrupt a global cryptocurrency network, in coordination with international partners. The United States will continue to raise the costs on Russia for its war in Ukraine and to deprive the Russian defense industrial base of resources.
I will convene a leader-level meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group in Germany next month to coordinate the efforts of the more than 50 countries supporting Ukraine in its defense against Russian aggression.
Through these actions, my message is clear: The United States will provide Ukraine with the support it needs to win this war.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-united-states-assistance-ukraine
Joe Biden,"October 02, 2024",International Counter Ransomware Initiative 2024 Joint Statement,"The 68 members of the International Counter Ransomware Initiative (CRI)—Albania, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Bahrain, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Cameroon, Canada, Chad, Colombia, Costa Rica, the Council of Europe, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, the Dominican Republic, the ECOWAS Commission, Egypt, Estonia, the European Union, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, the Global Forum on Cyber Expertise, Hungary, India, INTERPOL, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Kenya, Lithuania, Mexico, Morocco, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, the Organization of American States, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, the Republic of Korea, the Republic of Moldova, Romania, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Switzerland, Ukraine, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, the United States, Uruguay, Vanuatu, and Vietnam—met in Washington, D.C. from September 30 - October 3, 2024 for the Fourth CRI Gathering. Previously participating members welcomed Argentina, Bahrain, Cameroon, Chad, the Council of Europe, Denmark, the ECOWAS Commission, Finland, the Global Forum on Cyber Expertise, Hungary, Morocco, the Organization of American States, the Philippines, the Republic of Moldova, Slovenia, Sri Lanka, Vanuatu, and Vietnam as new CRI members.
During the Fourth CRI Gathering, members reaffirmed our joint commitment to develop collective resilience to ransomware, support members if they are faced with a ransomware attack, pursue the actors responsible for ransomware attacks and not allow safe haven for these actors to operate within our jurisdictions, counter the use of virtual assets as part of the ransomware business model, partner with the private sector to advise and support CRI members, and forge international partnerships so we are collectively better equipped to counter the scourge of ransomware.
Over the past year, this coalition has grown and continues to build upon the commitments made at the Third CRI Gathering in 2023. The United States launched a new fund for CRI members to strengthen members' cybersecurity capabilities through both rapid assistance in the wake of a cyber attack, as well as targeted support to improve cybersecurity skills, policies, and response procedures.
The Policy Pillar, led by Singapore and the United Kingdom, spearheaded efforts to build resilience against ransomware attacks and leverage the ecosystem to disrupt the ransomware criminal industry. These efforts seek to undercut the business model that underpins the ransomware ecosystem by driving forward work on secure software and labeling, methods to counter the use of virtual assets as part of the ransomware business model, policies to reduce ransom payments, increase and improve reporting, cyber insurance, and a playbook to guide businesses on how to prepare for, deal with, and recover from a ransomware attack. Of note, CRI members and insurance bodies have endorsed guidance to help organizations experiencing a ransomware attack. The guidance underscores the important role cyber insurance can play in helping to build resilience to cyber attacks and highlights actions organizations should explore during an incident. In addition, the Pillar held a table-top-exercise to assist members in identifying gaps in their processes, learning best practices and supporting members develop effective responses to ransomware attacks on the healthcare sector.
The Diplomacy and Capacity Building Pillar, led by Germany and Nigeria, expanded the CRI's partnerships with the addition of 18 new members to the coalition and mapped out the capacity building assets and needs of members. To foster collaboration, forge new partnerships, and recruit new members into the Initiative, CRI members hosted regional events throughout the year.
Under the leadership of Australia and Lithuania, the ICRTF focused its work on building resilience against malicious cyber attacks through international cooperation. Lithuania and Australia, as ICRTF co-chairs, worked to develop governance for information sharing and increase onboarding of members to the information sharing platforms led by Lithuania and Belgium as well as Israel and UAE. These platforms will allow members to easily share threat information and indicators of compromise. In a project led by INTERPOL and Australia, a comparative report was produced analyzing Ransomware Interventions and Remediation in CRI members' jurisdictions. Australia launched a website and member portal so CRI members can easily share information and best practices, foster collaboration, and use as a mechanism to request assistance from the CRI community when experiencing a ransomware attack. The ICRTF co-chairs presented a statement for members to join that calls for responsible behavior in cyberspace and encourages members to hold malicious actors accountable and deny them safe haven using all of the cyber diplomacy and law enforcement tools at their disposal.
Canada established a new Public-Private Sector Advisory Panel to advise and support CRI members in combating ransomware. This advisory panel will catalyze effective information sharing, build trust through clear expectations and person to person collaboration, and develop best practices to navigate practical hurdles.
The Initiative also hosted its first-ever event dedicated to examining the use of AI to counter ransomware attacks. Topics of discussion included the use of AI to track threat actor use, AI for Software Security, scenario planning around ransomware attacks on the healthcare industry, and tools such as watermarking to counter disinformation.
Through the Initiative's annual gathering as well as the dedicated work and regional meetings occurring between each meeting, we commit to working together at both a policy and operational level to counter ransomware threats and hold perpetrators of these malicious attacks accountable. CRI continues to call for responsible behavior in cyberspace and encourage members to call out malicious acts, and we remain committed to using all appropriate tools to achieve these goals, and are jointly committed to the following actions in support of this mission.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/international-counter-ransomware-initiative-2024-joint-statement
Joe Biden,"October 23, 2024",Statement on the Group of Seven (G-7) Nations Decision To Leverage Russian Sovereign Assets in Support of Ukraine,"This summer, I led an effort to bring the G-7 together to commit $50 billion in Extraordinary Revenue Acceleration loans to Ukraine backed by the profits of immobilized Russian sovereign assets. After Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine, the G-7 took bold action to immobilize Russia's sovereign assets in our jurisdictions and committed that these assets will remain immobilized until Russia ends its aggression and pays for the damage it has caused to Ukraine, paving the way for Extraordinary Revenue Acceleration loans.
As part of the G-7 package, the United States is announcing today that we will provide $20 billion in loans to Ukraine that will be paid back by the interest earned from immobilized Russian sovereign assets. In other words, Ukraine can receive the assistance it needs now, without burdening taxpayers. These loans will support the people of Ukraine as they defend and rebuild their country. And our efforts make it clear: Tyrants will be responsible for the damages they cause.
Make no mistake: Russia will not prevail in this conflict. The people of Ukraine will prevail. This is another reminder to Vladimir Putin that the world has rallied behind Ukraine, and the United States and our G-7 partners will continue to stand with them every step of the way.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-the-group-seven-g-7-nations-decision-leverage-russian-sovereign-assets-support
Joe Biden,"October 24, 2024",Statement on World Polio Day,"The United States is proudly a leader and core strategic partner in the world's quest to eradicate polio and because of our efforts, the world has a historic window of opportunity to end polio for good. Today we reaffirm our commitment to secure a polio-free future.
Through our leadership in the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, our sustained commitment to ending polio has resulted in 20 million people walking today who otherwise could have been paralyzed. We have reduced the number of children paralyzed by 99.9 percent and vaccinated over 3 billion children against polio. However, polio persists in some of the world's most challenging environments.
If high vaccination rates against polio are not achieved and maintained, including amidst instability, conflict, and misinformation mounting around the world, the risk of polio outbreaks will rise even in places long considered polio-free, like we've recently seen in New York, London, and Ukraine, as well as in Gaza, where all parties must ensure the safe and effective implementation of the polio vaccination campaign that is urgently needed throughout Gaza.
In order to achieve the goal of eradicating polio, the world must rally together. Delivering a polio-free world with stronger health systems and communities is not only the right thing to do for humanity, but a smart investment in the health of future generations and our collective global health security. Together, we can make it a reality.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-world-polio-day
Joe Biden,"October 25, 2024",Joint Statement by Group of Seven (G-7) Nations Leaders on Extraordinary Revenue Acceleration (ERA) Loans to Ukraine,"Today, we, the Leaders of the Group of Seven (G7), have reached a consensus on how to deliver approximately $50 billion in Extraordinary Revenue Acceleration (ERA) loans to Ukraine.
These loans will be serviced and repaid by future flows of extraordinary revenues stemming from the immobilization of Russian Sovereign Assets, in line with G7 respective legal systems and international law. The loan proceeds will be disbursed through multiple channels to support Ukraine's budgetary, military and reconstruction assistance, as consistent with all applicable law and G7 members' respective legal systems. Our aim is to begin disbursing the funds by the end of the year.
We express our utmost appreciation for the timely implementation of this historic G7 Leaders' decision by the Finance Ministers, who have agreed on a technical solution ensuring consistency, coordination, fair distribution of lending, and solidarity among all G7 partners. We are particularly grateful to the European Union and its Member States for their constructive engagement towards this remarkable result.
Today's announcement confirms that the G7 fulfills the commitment they made in June at the Apulia G7 Leaders' Summit. Russian illegal and unprovoked aggression has caused untold harm to the people of Ukraine and to global peace and security. We will not tire in our resolve to give Ukraine the support it needs to prevail. Russia must end its illegal war of aggression and pay for the damage it has caused to Ukraine in line with international law.
The G7 remains steadfast in its solidarity to support Ukraine's fight for freedom, and its recovery and reconstruction. With the large amount of financing from the ERA loans to meet its pressing need, we have once again made clear our unwavering commitment to stand by Ukraine for as long as it takes.

Joe Biden,"November 12, 2024",Joint Statement by President Biden and President Prabowo Subianto Djojohadikusumo of Indonesia—Commemorating 75 Years of Diplomatic Relations,"Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. is honored to welcome Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto to Washington, D.C. As we commemorate 75 years of diplomatic relations, we reflect on our shared experiences, from which we have emerged as the world's second- and third-largest democracies.
As part of this growing relationship, one year ago, Indonesia and the United States elevated bilateral relations to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP) and institutionalized efforts to expand cooperation amidst global and emerging challenges.
As we deepen our diplomatic, economic, and security cooperation, we pay tribute to our predecessors for their wisdom, courage, and vision. Building on this shared history, the two leaders reaffirmed our commitment to democracy, pluralism, human rights, and a stable and open international system. The leaders committed to continue advancing our vision for an open, transparent, inclusive, and rules-based Indo-Pacific regional architecture, with ASEAN at the center, that upholds international law. Building on their CSP, the leaders pledged to work to ensure a strong, resilient, and prosperous Indonesia and underlined their countries' shared commitment to promote peace and stability in Southeast Asia and the Indo-Pacific region.
Fostering a Long-Term Partnership 
The leaders applauded the progress in our partnership, reflecting deepening ties and a mutual desire to foster greater understanding between the United States and Indonesia. To sustain and further elevate this momentum, both leaders underscored their commitment to regularly convene the Comprehensive Strategic Dialogue between Indonesia's Minister for Foreign Affairs and the U.S. Secretary of State. Both leaders committed to deepen relations further by introducing new cooperation in areas such as climate, energy, human and labor rights, foreign policy, and national security policy. The two leaders also welcomed the revival of the bipartisan Congressional Friends of Indonesia Caucus by U.S. Representatives Strickland and Miller, and look forward to sustained legislative cooperation to enhance dialogue and mutual understanding on U.S.-Indonesia relations.
Looking to the future, the two countries will build on the CSP to increase dialogue on domestic, regional, and global security issues as we learn from each other's experiences, ensuring that our shared history and democratic values remain central to our efforts. Both countries are committed to continuing the annual consular and management dialogue to ensure each can shape better policy and adequately manage consular and diplomatic facilities to support this elevated relationship, in accordance with international conventions, bilateral agreements, and the respective laws of both countries.
Encouraging Sustainable, Inclusive, and Resilient Economic Growth 
The United States government stands ready to assist the Indonesian government as it strives to improve food security through sustainable agriculture. To advance these efforts, the leaders highlighted their commitment to promote research collaboration at the nexus of artificial intelligence (AI) and sustainable farming practices, including through the 2nd Indonesia-U.S. Digital Technology Dialogue on Agriculture. The two sides also committed to strengthen Indonesia's food resilience through promotion of sustainable management practices for fisheries and aquaculture, and enhancing the effectiveness of Indonesia's marine protected areas management, in line with respective national laws.
The two leaders reaffirmed the importance of innovation-driven, inclusive and sustainable economic growth to deliver better livelihoods for the American and Indonesian peoples. Both sides affirmed their membership to the Open Government Partnership to enhance transparency, accountability and public participation and advance anti-corruption priorities. Both sides are committed to deepening engagement and cooperation on economic policy based on business best practices, labor rights, and human rights and fair trade, including through the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) in all pillars and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. We recognize the importance of the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) in fostering trade, supporting industry and promoting sustainable development for both countries. As part of this effort, we will explore holding a strategic economic dialogue and a U.S.-Indonesia Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) meeting.
President Biden expressed his support for Indonesia's efforts towards an expedited accession bid to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which provides a pathway to faster and higher quality economic growth through stronger and more accountable policy. As the process gets under way, the United States looks forward to working with the Indonesian government to ensure it is successful in aligning with OECD standards and best practices, including by supporting Indonesia as it undertakes all necessary economic, governance, trade, and labor reforms. The two leaders also expressed their commitment to a rules-based international trading system and recognized the importance of multilateral institutions and norms which promote free and fair trade. Both leaders pledged to advance dialogue and consultations in settling WTO disputes.
President Subianto and President Biden acknowledged the essential role of diverse and resilient critical mineral supply chains to bolster the manufacturing sector and economic growth in both nations, as well as support the global clean energy transition. They affirmed their commitment to develop a critical minerals supply chain in both countries through a mutually beneficial partnership that promotes principles of sustainable development, including strong environmental and labor standards. To achieve this, they pledged to expedite ongoing discussions on critical minerals.
Reaffirming that the climate crisis poses an existential threat, the leaders reaffirmed their commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This includes submitting 2035 nationally determined contributions (NDC) under the Paris Agreement that are aligned with limiting global warming to 1.5 degree Celsius and in the spirit of responding positively to the first Global Stocktake. We are committed to more ambitious, economy-wide emission reduction targets, covering all greenhouse gases, sectors and categories that are aligned with achieving our respective net-zero targets.
They further resolve to expand collaboration on clean and renewable energy generation and to accelerate their clean energy transitions. Indonesia and the United States are continuing to closely and concretely collaborate, including with other partners, on the Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) by implementing the Comprehensive Investment and Policy Plan. JETP, in parallel with domestic policy reform, will continue to mobilize investments in Indonesia's domestic renewable energy production to reduce emissions, strengthen and expand the grid, advance energy security, create jobs, and grow the clean energy economy in Indonesia.
President Biden and President Subianto discussed carbon capture and storage (CCS) and methane abatement as key opportunities for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Both leaders expressed their commitment to supporting methane reduction capacity building. The two leaders seek to develop affordable and cost-effective CCS solutions and deploy methane abatement strategies that contribute to Indonesia's net-zero targets and global climate goals. President Biden congratulated Indonesia on its recent success in reducing emissions from deforestation and offered continued U.S. support for Indonesia to reach its forestry and land sector net sink target by 2030.
As one way to mobilize private finance for emissions reductions from forests and other sectors, President Biden expressed his support for Indonesia's efforts to develop a high-integrity carbon market and offered U.S. support for accessing international demand for carbon credits. The leaders pledged to deepen bilateral discussions under the U.S.-Indonesia Climate Change Working Group and through technical cooperation.
Promoting Innovation through Digital and Technology Cooperation 
Both Indonesia and the United States concurred that AI and other digital technologies should be optimized to enable sustainable development and bridge the digital divide. President Biden and President Subianto underscored the pressing need to enhance capacity building to ensure equitable access to secure and resilient AI and related digital innovations. The leaders also welcomed the opportunity to expand radio access network (Open RAN) projects in Indonesia, acknowledging the importance of improving Indonesia's cellular network performance, creating a secure, resilient, and fostering a competitive ecosystem for advanced technology, and providing broader connectivity.
The two leaders acknowledged the need to continuously explore initiatives to secure cyberspace and welcomed the intention to elevate their cooperation, particularly through the exchange of best practices, capacity building, and research cooperation in the near future. This enhanced collaboration should be rooted in their shared desire to promote a peaceful, secure, and resilient cyberspace that serves as an enabler of economic progress and betterment of living standards for all. The leaders also celebrated the U.S. State Department's partnership with the Government of Indonesia through the International Technology Security and Innovation (ITSI) Fund under the CHIPS Act of 2022.
The leaders expressed their intention to enhance Indonesia's human resource capacity in the semiconductor industry, as well as human resources development, through collaborations with American universities and optimizing U.S. government support through the ITSI Fund. The United States is committed to support Indonesia in developing its small modular reactor (SMR) technology, including by expediting ongoing feasibility studies and exploring potential collaboration to build Indonesian expertise through nuclear assessor research certification programs.
Investing in People, Education, and Health 
We also use this opportunity to commemorate the 20th anniversary of a massive tsunami that devastated coastal communities across the Indian Ocean region, including Aceh Province in Indonesia. In response, the United States mobilized over $400 million in emergency aid to support Indonesia's response, assisting over 580,000 people. President Biden and President Subianto recognize the resourcefulness and perseverance of the tsunami's survivors and applaud the bravery of humanitarian responders. We have built on this experience, and expanded our cooperation to include a Memorandum of Understanding between our disaster management agencies. Our leaders reaffirmed our commitment to boost disaster risk reduction and to work together on humanitarian aid and disaster relief to other vulnerable locations.
Building on our strong people-to-people ties, President Biden and President Subianto underscored their plan to deepen cooperation in education, research, and development. The leaders announced the opening of a new American Corner in Makassar in 2025. The two leaders also welcomed further cooperation to promote science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) fields, language education, and entrepreneurship collaboration, with a focus on women, youth, and persons with disabilities. As part of these efforts, both leaders emphasized the importance of expanding vocational and skills training, technical education and certification with a focus on technology, manufacturing, health, hospitality, construction, and creative industries.
Both countries are also committed to furthering health cooperation to advance clinical research, public health goals, and health systems to address emerging and chronic health conditions, as well as infectious diseases, including tuberculosis. The two leaders also welcomed a future signing of an elevated Memorandum of Understanding on health between Indonesia and the United States. This effort underscores both nation's unwavering commitment to collaborate to realize Indonesia's health transformation goals. President Biden also expressed support for Indonesia's national program to provide nutritious and healthy meals for school children and expecting mothers.
Both leaders emphasized the significance of recognizing and honoring their respective cultural heritage, which serve as invaluable bridges in fostering stronger people-to-people connections. President Subianto further commended the United States for its support of Indonesia's safeguarding of its cultural heritage from the growing threat of illicit trafficking, including the continued repatriation of Indonesian artifacts held within the United States. The leaders also applauded the new U.S. Ambassadors Fund for Cultural Preservation project to assist Indonesian museums to build new documentation systems and enhance emergency preparedness.
Deepening United States-Indonesia Defense and Security Cooperation 
President Biden and President Subianto committed to strengthen bilateral defense cooperation, reaffirming their shared commitment to regional security and stability, and emphasizing the significance of the Defense Cooperation Arrangement concluded in 2023. Both leaders pledged to cooperate on strengthening maritime security capabilities and to combat illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, as well as fishing associated with transnational organized crime. The two leaders also welcome continued cooperation on defense and military modernization in a manner consistent with international human rights law and international humanitarian law.
President Biden praised Indonesia for successfully hosting the 2024 Super Garuda Shield exercise and the potential expansion of the multilateral exercise which recently engaged eight other partner nations, twelve observer countries, and over 6,000 personnel, aimed at enhancing collective security capabilities to better prepare for the challenges of an increasingly complex global landscape.
The two leaders reaffirmed their intention to hold the 2nd U.S.-Indonesia Senior Officials' Foreign Policy and Defense Dialogue, the 21st U.S.-Indonesia Security Dialogue (IUSSD), and the U.S. and Indonesia Bilateral Defense Discussion (USIBDD), before the end of the first quarter of 2025. In the field of maritime cooperation, both leaders welcomed the establishment of the U.S.-funded BAKAMLA 'Anambas' Maritime Training Center in Batam this year. Our leaders also reaffirmed their commitment to holding a maritime dialogue and intended to explore new areas of discussion, including cooperation on a sustainable maritime economy and advancing marine science and technology.

Our leaders reiterated full support for ASEAN's central role and the implementation of the ASEAN Five-Point Consensus, and expressed appreciation for the work of the ASEAN and UN Special Envoys on Myanmar.

Both leaders called on the concerned parties to comply fully with all relevant UNSCRs and to engage in peaceful dialogue.
President Biden and President Subianto reiterated the urgent call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza through the release of hostages, an exchange of prisoners, the free flow of humanitarian assistance, and an end to the conflict. The two leaders expressed grave concern over the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, and condemned all attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure. The leaders underscored that the future recovery and reconstruction of Gaza will rely on sustained engagement from the international community. Both leaders remain committed to a viable and independent Palestinian state and Israel's security concerns as part of a two-state solution that enable both Israelis and Palestinians to live in a just, lasting and secure peace. Any unilateral actions that undermine the prospect of a two-state solution, including expansion of Israeli settlements and violent extremism on all sides, must end. The leaders underscore the need to prevent the conflict from escalating and spreading further into the region. The two leaders reaffirmed that it is imperative to reach a diplomatic resolution in Lebanon.
Building off of our successful cooperation on Indonesia's airdrop of humanitarian aid to Gaza in April, President Biden and President Subianto also committed to expand cooperation on addressing the dire humanitarian conditions in Gaza. The leaders pledged to work together to facilitate the medical evacuation of Palestinian children in order to receive critical care, and committed to support humanitarian and early recovery activities on the ground in Gaza. President Biden conveyed his appreciation for Indonesia's role in the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) peacekeeping mission and joined Indonesia in calling for all to respect the inviolability of UN premises, as well as calling for the protection of and to avoid military activity that might risk harming UNIFIL personnel.
The leaders discussed the war against Ukraine and reaffirmed our respect for sovereignty, political independence, territorial integrity, and the UN Charter. Both leaders underlined the importance of serious engagement in a genuine dialogue for the peaceful resolution of the conflict. They also called for the facilitation of rapid and safe access to humanitarian assistance for those in need in Ukraine, and for the protection of civilians, humanitarian personnel, and persons in vulnerable situations.
President Biden welcomed Indonesia's leadership in the G20 on issues of concern to the developing world, including on evolving the multilateral development banks and strengthening the global health architecture. The two leaders pledged to cooperate on providing a pathway to growth for developing countries by unlocking space for countries with mounting debt burdens to invest in their futures.
Both countries also stressed the importance of continuing the discussions towards the UN Security Council reform.

Joe Biden,"November 15, 2024","Joint Statement by President Biden, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba of Japan, and President Yoon Suk Yeol of South Korea","We, the leaders of Japan, the Republic of Korea (ROK), and the United States, convened in the spirit of Camp David to commemorate the remarkable progress our three countries have made since our Trilateral Leaders' Summit in 2023. Japan, the ROK, and the United States stand united in our dedication to promote human rights, democracy, security, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond. We remain determined to align our collective efforts to ensure the continued success of our peoples, the region, and the world. We remain steadfast in our support for a free and open rules-based international order. The actions that we take together will continue to bolster regional and global peace and security well into the future.
***
During the past 15 months, we have constructed a trilateral partnership that is built to last. Today, we announce the establishment of the Trilateral Secretariat responsible for coordinating and implementing our shared commitments. This new secretariat will seek to ensure that the work we do together further aligns our objectives and actions to make the Indo-Pacific a thriving, connected, resilient, stable, and secure region.
We applaud our expanding trilateral security cooperation, including the successful first two iterations of the trilateral multi-domain exercise Freedom Edge and the signing of the Memorandum of Cooperation on the Trilateral Security Cooperation Framework to institutionalize trilateral cooperation among our defense authorities. Our trilateral defense engagements are expanding to annual Chiefs of Defense and ministerial meetings that build upon existing senior-level policy consultations, information sharing, trilateral exercises, and defense exchanges. Japan, the ROK, and the United States are promoting trilateral interoperability by sharing data in real time about ballistic missile launches by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and by working to strengthen our ballistic missile defense capabilities. We are enhancing junior officer exchanges to further build interoperability and people-to-people ties among our defense forces. President Biden reiterates that the U.S. commitments to the defense of the ROK and Japan are ironclad and reaffirms the U.S. commitment to strengthen extended deterrence cooperation through the ROK-U.S. and Japan-U.S. alliances. These actions underscore our three countries' shared commitment to consult on regional challenges, provocations, and threats affecting our collective interests and security.
We strongly condemn violations of multiple United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions by the DPRK and Russia, especially in light of the DPRK's decision to deploy troops to Russia for combat against Ukraine. Japan, the ROK, and the United States strongly condemn the decisions by the leaders of the DPRK and Russia to dangerously expand Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine. Deepening military cooperation between the DPRK and Russia, including munitions and ballistic missile transfers, is particularly egregious given Russia's status as a Permanent Member of the UN Security Council. We remain resolute as ever in supporting Ukraine as it exercises its inherent right to self-defense as enshrined in Article 51 of the UN Charter.
We reaffirm our commitment to the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, consistent with UNSC resolutions. We commit to respond firmly to violations and evasions of DPRK-related UNSC resolutions as well as any attempt to undermine the global non-proliferation regime. Japan, the ROK, and the United States are committed to the work of the new Multilateral Sanctions Monitoring Team responsible for conducting comprehensive and effective sanctions monitoring and reporting efforts regarding UNSC sanctions on the DPRK. We express grave concern over the DPRK's illicit revenue generation methods, including its use of arms transfers, malicious cyber activities, and the dispatch of workers abroad, to fund its unlawful weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs. We are committed to expanding trilateral efforts to counter the DPRK's malicious cyber program and illicit revenue generation, including by collaborating to build capacity across the Indo-Pacific region to better protect against illicit DPRK activities. Our three countries continue to call for adherence to shared international norms and responsible behavior in the cyber domain to protect public critical infrastructure placed at risk by disruptive or destabilizing cyber activities. Prime Minister Ishiba and President Biden acknowledge their support for President Yoon's vision of a free, peaceful, and prosperous Korean Peninsula and reiterate their support for a unified Korean Peninsula that is free and at peace. With a clear recognition of the inextricable link between DPRK human rights issues and international peace and security, we promote the advancement of human rights in the DPRK and call for the immediate resolution of the issues of abductees, detainees, and unrepatriated prisoners of war.
We reaffirm the importance of maintaining peace and stability throughout the Indo-Pacific region. We reaffirm our unwavering support for ASEAN centrality and unity and for the ASEAN-led regional architecture. We are committed to working closely with ASEAN to support robust implementation and mainstreaming of the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific. We express concerns about illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, and we take this opportunity to announce a new Trilateral Maritime Security and Law Enforcement Cooperation Framework that will strengthen our cooperation on shared regional challenges and protect rules-based approaches to the maritime domain.
We strongly oppose any unilateral attempts to change the status quo in the waters of the Indo-Pacific, and we recognize the importance of opposing unlawful maritime claims in the South China Sea. We steadfastly oppose the dangerous use of coast guard and maritime militia vessels and coercive activities in the South China Sea. We express support for the global maritime order, including the freedoms of navigation and overflight, based on international law, as reflected in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. We recognize that peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait is an indispensable element of security and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region. There is no change in our basic positions on Taiwan, and we call for the peaceful resolution of cross-Strait issues.
Japan, the ROK, and the United States are committed to deepening our trilateral economic partnership, including through continuing our close coordination on economic security. Japan and the United States look forward to the ROK's hosting of APEC in 2025 and welcome the ROK's chairmanship of the Minerals Security Partnership (MSP). Japan and the United States are committed to closely coordinating with the ROK to accelerate MSP projects. We recognize the MSP as a crucial institutional forum to develop a more diverse and sustainable critical minerals supply chain. We welcome the progress made by the Resilient and Inclusive Supply-chain Enhancement (RISE) partnership. We commend the Trilateral Economic Security Dialogue for deepening trilateral engagements on economic security issues, and we welcome regularized, active consultation among our countries to exchange early warning information on supply chain disruptions. We applaud the successful first trilateral meeting between our finance ministries and look forward to the next convening. We commit to continue cooperating to promote sustainable economic growth and financial stability, as well as orderly and well-functioning financial markets. We commend the successful launch of the first trilateral Commerce and Industry Ministerial Meeting and look forward to the next convening. We reaffirm our longstanding commitment to advancing women's economic empowerment, including through the upcoming 2024 Trilateral Women's Economic Empowerment Conference in Washington. We applaud women leaders in STEM who are working to address barriers to entry and advancement. In addition, we are committed to enhancing cooperation within the Crisis Response Network established under the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework Supply Chain Agreement—with the ROK as the Chair and Japan as the Vice Chair—to ensure members maintain access to vital supplies during emergencies.
We concur on the need for trilateral collaboration on technology security, standards, and trusted ecosystems, and we commit to develop a trilateral framework to further advance our next generation critical and emerging technology cooperation. We hail the successful launch of the Trilateral Technology Leaders Training Program, which has served to train and connect policymakers focusing on semiconductors, artificial intelligence (AI), quantum technology, digital economy, biotechnology, cybersecurity, energy, and space. In addition, Japan, the ROK, and the United States are working to accelerate the development of a trusted AI ecosystem across our three countries. We are strengthening commercial collaboration around AI chips in addition to enhancing protections for critical technology and strengthening engagement on AI safety. We are working to build resilient supply chains for active pharmaceutical ingredients through the ""Bio-5"" coalition. As founding members of the Quantum Development Group, we look forward to further strengthening cooperation on supply chains and trusted investment in our quantum ecosystems. We are proud of the launch of a new quantum workforce program by IBM, in partnership with Japanese, Korean, and U.S. universities, which aims to train 40,000 students over the next decade. We also welcome trilateral cooperation among our national research institutes, and we stress the significance of the successful launch of the Disruptive Technology Protection Network, which is essential for combatting illicit technology transfer.
Japan, the ROK, and the United States also are expanding our cooperation on development and humanitarian assistance across the globe, including through a senior-level biennial policy dialogue. Together, Japan, the ROK, and the United States have expanded trilateral development assistance to the Philippines and Ukraine. We commit to further advance collaboration in critical sectors across the Philippines, including ports modernization, energy infrastructure, agribusiness, and large-scale transportation projects. We support trilateral digital infrastructure and telecommunications initiatives in Southeast Asia, including through the expansion of digital infrastructure using Open RAN approaches across the region.
People-to-people ties between Japan, the ROK, and the United States are rapidly expanding, and we are discussing ways to maintain and build upon this momentum. We applaud the successful first Trilateral Global Leadership Youth Summit this year and look forward to the 2025 Youth Summit in Japan as the next iteration of what we hope will become an annual convening of youth delegates focused on tackling our shared security, economic, and environmental challenges. Furthermore, we support the newly launched Young Trilateral Leaders program, which aims to foster dialogue between our countries and concrete action by young people on global challenges.
***
Our cooperation has soared to new heights in every corner of our governments, and we have created a brighter, safer, and more prosperous future for our people. We are proud of the partnership we have built and believe that the Japan-ROK-U.S. relationship will be a ballast of peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific for years to come.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/joint-statement-president-biden-prime-minister-shigeru-ishiba-japan-and-president-yoon-suk
Joe Biden,"November 23, 2024",Statement Honoring the Victims of the Ukrainian Holodomor,"Ninety-one years ago, Joseph Stalin and the Soviet regime engineered the Holodomor, a forced and deliberate famine that killed millions of Ukrainians. We remember the men, women, and children who perished during the Holodomor. We also honor the survivors of the Holodomor and their descendants who, despite Stalin's efforts to repress Ukraine's national identity, have built a free, independent, and democratic Ukraine.
Today, as we mark the solemn anniversary of the Holodomor, we also renew our commitment to stand with the Ukrainian people in their time of need. For nearly 3 years, Russia has been waging a brutal war against the Ukrainian people in an attempt to wipe Ukraine off the map. In this effort, Russia has failed. Kyiv stands free, thanks in part to the United States and the more than 50 other countries that are committed to providing Ukraine with the assistance it needs to defend itself.
My message to the Ukrainian people on this day is clear: The United States honors your past and stands with you in the present. On this day, we reaffirm our commitment to supporting Ukraine's ongoing defense of its freedom, its pursuit of justice, and its path to the Euro-Atlantic future it has chosen for itself. The courage and strength of the Ukrainian people will prevail.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-honoring-the-victims-the-ukrainian-holodomor-1
Joe Biden,"November 28, 2024",Statement on Russia's Attack Against Ukraine,"Overnight, Russia carried out a horrific aerial attack against Ukraine. Ukrainian authorities report that Russia launched nearly 200 missiles and drones against Ukrainian cities and energy infrastructure, depriving Ukrainian civilians of access to electricity. This attack is outrageous and serves as yet another reminder of the urgency and importance of supporting the Ukrainian people in their defense against Russian aggression.
On this day, my message to the Ukrainian people is clear: The United States stands with you. Earlier this year, and at my direction, the United States began prioritizing air defense exports so they go to Ukraine first. The Department of Defense has delivered hundreds of additional air defense missiles to Ukraine as a consequence of this decision, and further deliveries are underway. For months, my administration has been working to help Ukraine increase the resilience of its energy grid in preparation for the winter, and the Department of Defense continues to surge other critical capabilities to Ukraine, including artillery, rockets, and armored vehicles.
Russia continues to underestimate the bravery, resilience, and determination of the Ukrainian people. The United States stands with more than 50 countries in support of Ukraine and its fight for freedom.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-russias-attack-against-ukraine
Joe Biden,"December 25, 2024",Statement on Russia's Aerial Attacks Against Ukraine,"In the early hours of Christmas, Russia launched waves of missiles and drones against Ukrainian cities and critical energy infrastructure. The purpose of this outrageous attack was to cut off the Ukrainian people's access to heat and electricity during winter and to jeopardize the safety of its grid. Let me be clear: The Ukrainian people deserve to live in peace and safety, and the United States and the international community must continue to stand with Ukraine until it triumphs over Russia's aggression. In recent months, the United States has provided Ukraine with hundreds of air defense missiles, and more are on the way. I have directed the Department of Defense to continue its surge of weapons deliveries to Ukraine, and the United States will continue to work tirelessly to strengthen Ukraine's position in its defense against Russian forces.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-russias-aerial-attacks-against-ukraine
Joe Biden,"December 30, 2024",Statement on United States Security Assistance to Ukraine,"Today I am proud to announce nearly $2.5 billion in security assistance for Ukraine, as the Ukrainian people continue to defend their independence and freedom from Russian aggression.
Since Russia launched its further assault against Ukraine in February 2022, the United States has rallied the world to stand with the Ukrainian people, and it has been a top priority of mine to provide Ukraine with the support it needs to prevail. Today's announcement—which includes an additional $1.25 billion drawdown package for the Ukrainian military and a $1.22 billion Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) package—builds on this effort and will provide Ukraine with both an immediate influx of capabilities that it continues to use to great effect on the battlefield and longer term supplies of air defense, artillery, and other critical weapons systems.
As I committed earlier this year, the Department of Defense has now allocated all remaining USAI funds appropriated by Congress in the supplemental that I signed in April, and my administration is fully utilizing the funding appropriated by Congress to support the drawdown of U.S. equipment for Ukraine. I've directed my administration to continue surging as much assistance to Ukraine as quickly as possible, including drawing down older U.S. equipment for Ukraine, rapidly delivering it to the battlefield, and then revitalizing the U.S. defense industrial base to modernize and replenish our stockpiles with new weapons. The Department of Defense is in the process of delivering hundreds of thousands of artillery rounds, thousands of rockets, and hundreds of armored vehicles which will strengthen Ukraine's hand as it heads into the winter.
At my direction, the United States will continue to work relentlessly to strengthen Ukraine's position in this war over the remainder of my time in office.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-united-states-security-assistance-ukraine
Joe Biden,"January 07, 2025",Statement on the Resignation of Prime Minister Justin P.J. Trudeau of Canada,"The last time I visited Ottawa, I said that the United States chooses to link our future with Canada because we know that we'll find no better ally, no closer partner, and no steadier friend. The same can be said of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
When I became President, he was the first foreign leader I spoke with. I spoke to him yesterday and expressed my appreciation for his partnership over the years. Together, we've tackled some of the toughest issues our nations faced in decades, from the COVID-19 pandemic, to climate change, to the scourge of fentanyl. We've stood together with the people of Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression to defend our nations' most sacred value: freedom. And we have made generational investments to strengthen our supply chains and rebuild our economies from the bottom up and middle out, establishing North America as the most economically competitive region in the world.
Over the last decade, Prime Minister Trudeau has led with commitment, optimism, and strategic vision. The U.S.-Canada alliance is stronger because of him. The American and Canadian people are safer because of him. And the world is better off because of him.
I am proud to call him my friend. And I will be forever grateful for his partnership and leadership.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-the-resignation-prime-minister-justin-pj-trudeau-canada

The following is attributable to Spokesperson Ned Price:

Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III visited Kyiv, Ukraine yesterday to demonstrate the United States’ unwavering commitment to Ukraine and the Ukrainian people in their struggle against Russian aggression.

While in Kyiv, Secretary Blinken and Secretary Austin met with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, Minister of Defense Oleksiy Reznikov, Head of Presidential Administration Andriy Yermak, Chief of Defense General Valeriy Zaluzhny, and Ambassador Oksana Markarova. They discussed America’s stalwart support for the Ukrainian government and Ukrainian people, including through our significant assistance to Ukraine’s security, governance, economic, and humanitarian needs. Secretary Blinken also voiced renewed support for Ukraine’s efforts to end the Russian aggression through diplomacy and dialogue, noting that our continued support will strengthen Ukraine’s hand on the battlefield and at the negotiating table.

During their meeting, Secretary Blinken shared that President Biden will nominate Bridget Brink, currently the U.S. Ambassador to Slovakia, to be the next U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine. If confirmed, Ambassador Brink will lead our diplomatic mission in Ukraine with dedication and distinction. She previously served as Senior Advisor and Deputy Assistant Secretary in the Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs and as the Deputy Chief of Mission at the U.S. Embassies in Tashkent, Uzbekistan and Tbilisi, Georgia. Her decades of experience make her uniquely suited for this moment in Ukraine’s history.

Underscoring our intensive diplomatic engagement, Secretary Blinken also relayed that U.S. diplomats will be returning to Ukraine this week. The increased U.S. presence demonstrates our support for Ukraine and is part of the U.S. commitment to return our diplomats to our Embassy in Kyiv as soon as possible. This action will strengthen the Department’s ongoing commitment to facilitate humanitarian relief efforts and the delivery of assistance to the Government of Ukraine, while providing enhanced support to U.S. citizens.

Secretary Blinken informed President Zelenskyy that the United States intends to obligate more than $713 million in Foreign Military Financing (FMF) for Ukraine and 15 other Allied and partner nations in Central and Eastern Europe and the Balkan region. This includes $650 million in funding provided by the Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2022. More than $322 million in this obligation is for Ukraine and will provide support for the capabilities Ukraine needs as Russia’s forces train their focus on the Donbas; this assistance will also help Ukraine’s armed forces transition to more advanced weapons and air defense systems. This assistance will also help NATO Allies with backfilling capabilities they have donated to Ukraine from their own stockpiles. Additionally, Secretary Blinken told President Zelenskyy that on April 24 the Department notified Congress of a Foreign Military Sale of up to $165 million for non-standard ammunition for Ukraine. Since the start of Russia’s renewed invasion of Ukraine on February 24, the United States has committed roughly $3.7 billion in security assistance and has provided more than $4.3 billion since the start of the Biden Administration.

As part of our continuing assistance, Secretary Austin also informed the Government of Ukraine that the U.S. Department of Defense will expand military training for Ukrainian service members in the region on certain weapons systems being provided. He highlighted U.S. efforts to accelerate the delivery of these weapons, which are now arriving within days of announcement. And he underscored that, along with our Allies and partners, the United States will continue to coordinate the shipment of additional heavy weaponry, ammunition and spare parts from other nations. Secretary Austin also previewed for Ukrainian leaders the agenda for this week’s Defense Consultative Meeting in Germany. Convened by the United States, the Consultative Meeting will examine the operational picture on the ground and review near-term Ukrainian defense needs, while providing attendees an opportunity to examine ways in which Ukraine’s longer term national security interests can be best met.

Both Secretary Blinken and Secretary Austin shared their admiration for the everyday heroism exhibited by the Ukrainian people – whether the soldier on the frontlines, those who are ministering the wounded, sick, or vulnerable or the defiant grandmothers resisting Russian aggression. They noted that the bravery of Ukrainians in defending freedom and democracy inspires us all and underscored our confidence that an even stronger Ukraine will emerge from this conflict.

Remarks

Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State

NATO Headquarters

Brussels, Belgium

September 9, 2022

MODERATOR:  Good afternoon. The Secretary General and the Secretary of State will make introductory remarks, and then they’ll be happy to take a few questions.  Secretary General.

SECRETARY GENERAL STOLTENBERG:  Secretary Blinken, dear Tony, welcome back to NATO.  It’s always great to see you here and thank you for your personal leadership and your personal commitment to our transatlantic Alliance.

Today, the NATO flag and the flags of 30 allies are at half mast to honor Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.  She was a strong supporter of our transatlantic Alliance, of our armed forces, and our values.  She knew and worked with all NATO secretaries general, since the founding of NATO.  She visited NATO headquarters and hosted NATO leaders at Buckingham Palace.  I’ll always remember her wisdom, her warmth, and her strong personal interest in transatlantic security.  Our heartfelt condolences to King Charles III, the royal family, and the people of our allies, the United Kingdom and Canada.

We have just concluded a meeting of the North Atlantic Council, where we addressed NATO’s strong and united response to Russia’s brutal war on Ukraine.  This includes unprecedented military, financial, and humanitarian aid from allies so that Ukraine can uphold its right to self‑defense.  The United States is leading the way, and I welcome the billions of dollars of additional support announced this week.

Yesterday, I participated in the U.S.-led Ukraine Defense Contact Group in Russia.  We all agree on the importance of stepping and sustaining our winter support so that Ukraine prevails as an independent sovereign state.

In June, NATO leaders agreed a strengthened package of assistance with fuel, food, medical supplies, military gear, secure communications, and equipment to encounter mines and drones.  We will support Ukraine in the long term and help its transition from Soviet-era to modern NATO equipment.

The war in Ukraine is entering a critical phase.  Ukrainian forces have been able to stall Moscow’s offensive in Donbas, strike back behind Russian lines, and retake territory.  Just in the last few days, we have seen further progress – both in the south in Kherson, and in the east in the Kharkiv region.  This shows the bravery, skills, and determination of Ukrainian forces, and it shows that our support is making a difference every day on the battlefield.

In the coming months our unity and sovereignty will be tested with pressure on energy supplies and the soaring cost of living, caused by Russia’s war.  But the price we pay is measured in money, while the price Ukrainians are paying is measured in lives – lost lives every day.  And all of us will pay a much higher price, if Russia and all the authoritarian regimes see that their aggression is rewarded.

If Russia stops fighting, there will be peace.  If Ukraine stops fighting, it will cease to exist as an independent nation.  So we must stay the course for Ukraine’s sake and for ours.  At the same time, we are sending an unmistakable message to Moscow about our readiness to protect and defend every inch of our territory.  We are significantly enhancing our presence in the east of the Alliance, putting hundreds of thousands of troops on high readiness, supported with significant air and naval forces, and continuing to invest in cutting-edge capabilities.

All of this makes clear that our commitment to Article 5 is unshakeable.  Europe and North American must continue to stand together in NATO, in defense of our people, our nations, and our values.

So Secretary Blinken, dear Tony, thank you again for leadership, for being here, and for a strong personal commitment to our Alliance.  Please, start, of course.

SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Jens, thank you so much.  Thank you especially for your remarkable leadership of our Alliance in what is the decisive period of the Alliance.  We’ve come out of the NATO Summit with a new Strategic Concept.  We’ve faced Russian aggression in Ukraine.  We’ve done it together, and that’s in no small measure because of your leadership.

Before speaking about what brings me here today, I’d like to join Jens in taking a moment just to honor the truly extraordinary life of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.  On her 21st birthday, then Princess Elizabeth committed to dedicating her life to serving the people of the Commonwealth.  For more than 70 years – a period during which the United Kingdom and world witnessed unprecedented change – the Queen did just that, while personifying a sense of stability and continuity in turbulent times.  She was a powerful, unifying force, a source of comfort and resilience to millions of people from all walks of life.  On behalf of the United States, I extend our deepest condolences to our British friends, to the Government of the United Kingdom, to the royal family.

So as Jens noted, we just finished a session with our NATO Allies, where I had an opportunity to share a readout of my talks in Kyiv with President Zelenskyy, Foreign Minister Kuleba, and other senior Ukrainian officials.  I’ll have an opportunity to speak to President von der Leyen from the European Union tomorrow to continue the strong transatlantic cooperation that we’ve had on Ukraine and on so many other things.  These consultations are just the latest example of the unity and strength of our Alliance.

Yesterday, as I was in Kyiv, Secretary of Defense Austin convened the fifth meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, at Ramstein Air Base in Germany.  More than 50 countries took part, including Ukraine’s defense minister as well as the Secretary General.  Support from that group continues to make a decisive difference on the battlefield, where Ukraine’s great defenders are not just holding ground, they are retaking their sovereign territory in a two-front counteroffensive.

As I told President Zelenskyy, the support of the United States is unwavering.  I announced more than $2.8 billion in additional security assistance to Ukraine and also for its neighbors.  That support includes $675 million in new military aid to Ukraine.  This is part of the twentieth drawdown of military equipment that President Biden has initiated, going back before the Russian aggression.  It includes more guided multiple launch rocket systems, artillery ammunition, high-speed anti-radiation missiles, anti-tank systems.  The twentieth drawdown now totals $14.7 billion.

That sum also includes approximately $2.2 billion in what we call foreign military financing for Ukraine, but also for European allies and partners.  That will allow them to begin to begin to acquire assistance for the medium and long term that will be essential to deterring and, if necessary, defending against further Russian aggression in the years to come.

Our unity here at NATO, across our alliances and partnerships at the United Nations and other international institutions, is essential to advancing our objectives – shared objectives of supporting Ukraine’s capacity to defend itself, sustaining pressure on Russia for its aggression, ensuring that Ukraine is in the strongest position when conditions are ripe for negotiations.  As President Zelenskyy has said, and rightly said, diplomacy is the only way to definitively end Russia’s war of aggression.  We see in this moment no indication from Russia that it would be prepared to seriously pursue such diplomacy, but if and when that time comes, Ukraine has to be in the strongest possible position.

Now, President Putin thought that he would divide and weaken NATO.  Today, the Alliance is stronger, more unified, better resourced than ever before, and I heard further evidence in our session with NATO partners today.  We’ll soon welcome Finland and Sweden as new allies. We’ve approved a new Strategic Concept to meet twenty-first century threats, and more allies are meeting their pledge to spend two percent of their GDP on defense.

President Putin thought that he would divide the Ukrainian people and swiftly absorb their nation into Russia, but the Kremlin’s efforts to impose its will by force on Ukraine have only further united its people around the goal of defending their sovereignty and preserving a free and open democracy.

President Putin thought his invasion would showcase the Russian military’s might and sophistication.  Instead, the Russian army is turning to North Korea and Iran for badly needed supplies, while Ukraine’s military capability continues to get stronger, thanks to its leadership, thanks to the courage of its fighters, and thanks to the robust support from allies and partners.

President Putin thought that our willingness to apply economic pressure would fade with time.  Instead, we and our partners and allies have stuck together in the face of Moscow’s coercion and threats, imposing unprecedented costs on Russia’s economy.  To date, over 1,000 foreign companies have quit the Russian market.  Export controls on semiconductors and other advanced technologies mean that Russia cannot sustain – never mind modernize – key sectors, from automobile manufacturing to military exports, to energy exploration.

Russian imports parts and finished products, have been cut in half from a year ago.  What does that mean?  It means that they can’t replace the weapons that they’re using up in Ukraine, that they can’t make products for their domestic market, that their people are accustomed to buy.  They can’t produce things for export, which will shrink their foreign markets.

Half a million people – half a million people, many of them highly skilled workers – have left the country.  Russia’s foreign exchange reserves are estimated to have fallen by $75 billion and an additional $300 billion are currently frozen abroad.  Meanwhile, Russia is cut off from the international lending market.

All of this is building.  It’s cumulative.  It will get to be a heavier and heavier burden, as long as Russia’s aggression continues.

And yet, even as President Putin has failed in virtually all of his objectives, the human suffering he’s inflicted on Ukrainians and other people around the world is staggering.  I saw some of those consequences up close on my visit yesterday in Ukraine, including to Irpin, whose very name, like the battle of Bucha and Mariupol has become synonymous with Russian war crimes, including indiscriminate violence and the intentional targeting of civilians.

I saw the costs in my visit to the children’s hospital in Kyiv, where I met kids who will spend the rest of their lives without limbs, with enduring brain injuries, or with other trauma that may be invisible to the eye, because of atrocities committed by Russian forces.  Hundreds more Ukrainian boys and girls have been killed by this unprovoked war.

It’s not just Ukrainians who are bearing the costs.  As Russia falls short of its battlefield aims and is increasingly isolated on the global stage, President Putin has turned to blunter tools to try to peel off support from Ukraine.  He’s weaponized energy against European countries standing up to his aggression, raising the costs on families, on businesses, on entire nations.

President Putin is betting that these actions will break the will of countries to stand with Ukraine.  He’s betting that the Kremlin can bully other countries into submission.  He’s already lost that bet, because the last six and a half months show a growing recognition around the world that while the costs of standing up to the Kremlin’s aggression are high, the costs of standing down would be even higher.

That’s why the United States is doing everything in its power to support people around the world who are shouldering the greatest cost of Russia’s aggression, like our comprehensive efforts to help Europeans get though a winter during which they’ll face heavy energy costs, making it hard for many to heat their homes.  We won’t leave our European friends out in the cold.

It’s also an opportunity to make a decisive shift finally – once and for all – away from dependence on Russian energy, which Putin will never stop trying to weaponize to Europe’s detriment; and to make the transition to renewable sources, necessary as well to combat the climate crisis.  We can – we will – emerge stronger and in a better place.

And that’s why it’s so vital that we stay the course, that we stay united – united in support of Ukraine, united with our allies and partners, united for as long as it takes.  Thank you.

MODERATOR:  We’ll take questions now.  I see Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (inaudible).

QUESTION:  Thanks a lot.  Thomas Gutschker, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.  My question to you, Secretary Blinken:  We’ve seen this astonishing move of Ukrainian forces in the northeast of their country, pushing possibly 50 kilometers into Russian occupied territory.  How do you explain that?  It appears that the Russian army is hardly even fighting.  Is that – is it on the brink of collapse in that area.  Do you have an explanation for that?  And do you see this potentially as a turning point in this war?

And the question to the Secretary General, if I may:  You are constantly making the case for member states to send more ammunition, more arms to Ukraine.  One of the replies we are constantly hearing from our defense ministers is that it will compromise capacities that they have pledged to NATO.  So, when push comes to shove, and member states do have to make a decision on either supporting Ukraine or holding up their commitments to NATO, what is your suggestion?  What’s the right decision to take?

SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Yeah, so happy to start.  Thank you.  Let me say two things.  First, what we’re seeing is that the counteroffensive that the Ukrainians have put in place with strong systems and backing from many countries is now underway.  It’s early days, but it is demonstrably making real progress.  It’s focused in the south, around Kherson, in that area.  But we’re also seeing Ukraine not only hold the line in the Donbas and in the northeast, but as you noted, make a significant advance moving some 45 to 50 kilometers in one area past what had been the existing Russia line.

I think it’s too early to say exactly where this will go, when it will get there, and exactly where it will end up.  But I think we can say that Ukraine is proceeding in a very deliberate way with a strong plan, and critically enabled by resources that many of us are providing.

But fundamentally – and I think this may explain more directly the answer to your question – why am I absolutely confident in the success of the Ukrainians in pushing back the Russian aggression, whether it’s in the northeast, the Donbas, or in the south?  For one simple basic reason:  This is Ukraine’s homeland, not Russia.  People are fighting for their homeland; they’re fighting for their future.  And while we can calculate the benefits of weapon systems and financial resources, it’s hard to put a value on that determination to fight for one’s own country, except to say that it’s invaluable and the single biggest difference maker that I think we’ll see play out over the weeks and months ahead.

SECRETARY GENERAL STOLTENBERG:  NATO has had provided unprecedented support to Ukraine with the weapons, with the ammunition and other capabilities.  And of course, they have done that bolstered by reducing existing stocks.  And you are right that, of course, our allies are now raising the issue of whether these stocks are depleted too much.

My answer to that is actually twofold.  One is to realize that weapons, ammunitions that we are providing to Ukraine are used to stop the aggressive actions of Russia against an independent, sovereign nation in Europe which is a close partner of NATO.  And if President Putin wins in Ukraine, it’s not only bad for Ukrainians, but it is also dangerous for all of us.  So actually, by ensuring that Russia, that President Putin doesn’t win in Ukraine, we’re also increasing our own security and strengthening the Alliance by proving that we don’t allow that kind of behavior close to our own borders.  So, the use of these stocks actually helps to increase our own security and reduce the risk of any aggressive actions by Russia against NATO Ally countries.

Let me also add that more than 80 percent of Russia’s land forces are now dedicated to the war in Ukraine.  So for what happens there, not just for the total capacity of Russia to pose any threat to any NATO Ally from here.

So, my first message to the Allies is that we welcome the unprecedented support.  We are calling for even more support, and we urge them to dig deeply into the inventories, to the stocks, to continue to provide the supplies that Ukraine need immediately.  And we see that this is making a huge difference on the ground, because as Secretary Blinken – Tony – just referred to, there are – we see progress on the ground in Ukraine.  But make no mistakes, you have to be prepared for the long haul.

The second answer to the concern about the level of stocks is of course to produce more.  Therefore we are now in close contact with the defense industry, with capitals.  We have established structures here at NATO on defense planning, on capabilities, to ensure that we are now ramping up production, that we are replenishing the stocks, both to be able to continue to provide support to Ukraine, but this is not only about supporting Ukraine; it’s also about ensuring that we have the weapons, the munitions, the capabilities in place for our own deterrence and defense.

MODERATOR:  Okay, with Agence France-Presse.

QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Secretary.  Thank you, Mr. Secretary General.  Can I follow up on my colleague’s question a bit on the state of where it is?  Russia has just announced that they’re sending reinforcements into the Kharkiv area.  How do you see this going?  Do you think this is a sign of – how do you see this as a sign in terms of the direction that Russia’s going in?  And how do you see this as a – in terms of where it could be seen in Kharkiv?

Could I ask you also, since you’re talking about the Alliance and unity among the – within the Alliance, the question of Turkey.  Turkey, there was some concerns raised previously on Sweden and Finland.  This past weekend there were comments from President Erdoğan regarding Greece and comments perceived as threatening.  How do you see the role of Turkey in this?  Do you have any specific reaction to President Erdoğan’s remarks this weekend?  Thank you.

SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Shaun, thank you.  On the first question, following up on our German colleague, look, the counteroffensive, again, is in its early days, so I don’t want to prejudge, as I said, where it will go and how far it will get.  But the initial signs are positive, and we see Ukraine making real, demonstrable progress in a deliberate way.

But fundamentally, what we’re also seeing – and we’ve seen this throughout – even as President Putin threw as much as he could against Ukraine earlier this summer, Ukraine absorbed the blow and now is pushing back, enabled by our partners and allies, the United States.

But the single most important factor, I believe, is this: Ukrainians are fighting for their own country.  The Russian forces in Ukraine, many of them have no idea why they’re there.  Some didn’t even know where they were being sent.  We see reports that their morale is low, and when you don’t know what you’re fighting for, that is something that’s not sustainable.

Now, Russia has significant resources, military resources.  It is acting in horrific, indiscriminate ways.  Ukrainians are bearing an incredibly heavy cost, as Jens alluded to.  Their lives are on the line.  And even on the front lines now, in and around the Kherson area – even as they’re making progress, they’re bearing real costs.  But fundamentally they are fighting for their own homeland, they’re fighting for their future; the Russian forces in Ukraine are not.  And I am convinced that that is the most decisive factor, and we’re seeing some manifestations of that.  But this is likely to go on for some significant period of time.  There are a huge number of Russian forces that are in Ukraine, and unfortunately, tragically, horrifically, President Putin has demonstrated that he will throw a lot of people into this, at huge cost to Russia, at huge cost to its future.

And let me just add something I’ve said from the beginning.  How is what Putin is doing doing anything to improve the lives of the Russian people?  How is this helping them?  How is this assuring their own future?  How is this creating opportunity for them?  Not only is it not; it’s doing just the opposite.  It’s cutting Russia off from the world.  It’s denying opportunity.  It’s depleting its resources, resources that could go to help the Russian people.  In a closed information society that Putin has created in Russia, that information doesn’t get there as quickly as it otherwise might, but I believe it will.  And Russians have to ask themselves why in the world they are losing so many lives trying to take another country that is not theirs.

SECRETARY GENERAL STOLTENBERG:  Just briefly on that, yes, we see some encouraging signs.  The Russian offensive in Donbas has been stalled by the Ukrainian forces, and they are retaking some territory both in the east and in the south.  But make no mistake.  This can last for long time, and at least we have to be prepared for long haul and be ready to provide support to Ukraine for as long as it takes.

Wars are, by nature, unpredictable; and we know that Russia has a lot of military capabilities, and they are willing to use them to attack a sovereign, independent democratic nation, as we are seeing over the last months in Ukraine.

The first task is actually to be prepared for the winter.  The winter is coming, it’s going to be hard, and therefore we need both to continue to supply weapons and ammunition, but also winter clothing, tents, generators, and all the specific equipment which is needed for the winter.  Partly because the size of the Ukraine army has just increased so much, they need more of these kind of winter equipment; and NATO is particularly focused on how can we provide tens of thousands of, for instance, winter uniforms to the Ukrainian army.

On Turkey and Greece, Turkey and Greece are two highly valued Allies.  They participate and contribute to NATO in many different ways.  Any differences between them, of course, should be solved by diplomatic means.  We have also at NATO established what we call a deconfliction mechanism where Turkey and Greece can engage and have used this previously to provide information to provide also ways to deconflict any dangerous situation or behavior in, for instance, the Aegean Sea.

MODERATOR:  New York Times.

QUESTION:  Thank you.  I’d like to follow up on Shaun’s – I’d like to follow up on Shaun’s question about Turkey and just press a little bit more.  You talked about the importance of unity to the Alliance.  President Erdoğan in many ways, not only with this recent threat to Greece, seems to be threatening that unity.  He’s talked about another incursion into northeast Syria.  He renewed over the summer his threat to block the admission of Sweden and Finland into the Alliance, and then this latest issue with Greece, among others.  Just can you talk a little bit more about the effect this has on the unity you say is so crucial?

And specifically Secretary Blinken, I believe I heard you say in your introductory remarks that you’re confident or looking forward to Sweden and Finland being admitted into the Alliance.  Can you tell us what your basis for that optimism is given that President Erdoğan, as I said, renewed his threat over the summer to block their admission?

And if I just might briefly ask you to talk a little bit about where things stand with the Iran nuclear negotiations.  They appear to have stalled out, perhaps once and for all.  Can they be revived?  And what comes next?  Thank you.

SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Michael, thank you.  And I’m really going to defer to the secretary general on questions fundamentally related to NATO.  Let me simply say this.

First, with regard to Finland and Sweden, I think it’s very clear that there is a strong Alliance consensus, strong support for their admission.  We’ve seen the ratification of the protocols process move forward with land record speed, and there’s strong support in the United States, of course, from both political parties.  I had the honor of depositing the instruments of ratification last month.  So I’m very confident that this is moving forward, moving forward deliberately, but I would defer to Jens on anything further on that.

More broadly, I can only repeat what Jens said, for example, about Greece and Turkey – both vital, important Allies, friends of the United States.  They have differences, and of course we’d like to see them resolve these differences in a constructive way through dialogue.  They’ve done so in the past, and we would expect them to do so going forward.

And it is precisely because we have a fundamental challenge before us when it comes to Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, a challenge that matters to every single ally and many countries well beyond the Alliance, well beyond the transatlantic area.  And so, we should be making sure that we’re focusing all of our attention and our resources as necessary in supporting Ukraine and pushing back against Russia’s aggression.

Now, what I’ve heard in the room today with all of our NATO partners present was a very strong reaffirmation of that focus, of that unity – unity of purpose, unity of action.  President Biden heard that very clearly in the conversation that he initiated just yesterday with many of our partners.  Secretary Austin heard that and saw that at Ramstein where for the fifth time this coalition of countries has come together to further support Ukraine.  So what I’m seeing as a practical matter is an Alliance that is united and is focused on the biggest challenge that many of our countries face right now.

With regard to Iran and the JCPOA, a few things.  First, it’s a negotiation.  It’s back and forth.  We have a response from Iran to what was put forward most recently by the European Union.  We’ve been looking at that along with the European partners, and needless to say, I’m not about to negotiate anything in public.  In past weeks, we’ve closed some gaps.  Iran had moved away from some extraneous demands, demands unrelated to the JCPOA itself.  However, the latest response takes us backwards, and we are not about to agree to a deal that doesn’t meet our bottom line requirements and/or that tries to continuously introduce extraneous demands that are not relevant to the JCPOA itself.  If we conclude a deal, it’s only because it will advance our national security.  The President is focused on that, and what we’ve just seen again would appear to move us backward, not forward.

SECRETARY GENERAL STOLTENBERG:  On differences in NATO – yes, of course, there are differences in NATO.  We are 30 different Allies, 30 different democracies, and of course we don’t always agree on all issues.  And that has been the case since this Alliance was founded more than 70 years ago, dating back to the Suez Crisis in ’56 or the differences on the Iraq War 20 years ago.  And of course, we also see differences today.  What makes NATO the most successful alliance in history is that we’re able to overcome those differences, and then make decisions together, and then implement them together.

And we saw that demonstrated at the NATO summit in Madrid just a few months ago.  We made big decisions on further increasing our presence in the eastern part of Alliance.  We only had 40,000 troops under NATO command as a direct response to the Russian attack on Ukraine.  And we have also agreed to strengthen deterrence and defense across the whole Alliance.

We made also the decision to invite Finland and Sweden.  That’s an historic decision.  And all Allies agreed to invite them.  And I also welcome that, so far, this has been the fastest accession process in NATO’s modern history.  Up to now, 24 Allies have already ratified, in national parliaments, the accession protocols, and including the U.S. – the United States Senate.

And I also think it’s important to recognize that we have to take the security concerns of all Allies seriously, meaning that we need to address the fact that no other Ally have suffered – has suffered more terrorist attacks than Turkey.  And therefore, I welcome that as part of the agreement in Madrid – it was a trilateral agreement between Finland, Sweden, and Turkey to strengthen cooperation when it comes to fighting terrorism.  They have established a permanent mechanism to exchange more informations, to exchange intelligence, and to work more closely together.

So, I’m confident that we will move forward, and that Finland and Sweden will become members; and so, far this has been the fastest accession protocol process ever in NATO’s history.

MODERATOR:  I know there are more questions; unfortunately, we have run out of time, so this concludes this press conference.  Thank you.

United Nations

New York, N.Y.

February 24, 2023

SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Mr.  President, Mr.  Secretary-General, fellow council members:

One year and one week ago – on February 17th, 2022 – I warned this council that Russia was planning to invade Ukraine.

I said that Russia would manufacture a pretext, and then use missiles, tanks, soldiers, cyber attacks to strike pre-identified targets, including Kyiv, with the aim of toppling Ukraine’s democratically elected government.

Russia’s representative – the same representative who will speak today – called these, and I quote, “groundless accusations.”

Seven days later, on February 24th, 2022, Russia launched its full-scale invasion.

Due to fierce resistance by Ukraine’s defenders, President Putin failed in his primary objective to conquer Ukraine, end its existence as an independent country, and absorb it into Russia.

Then, he dusted off his Crimea playbook from 2014: He called snap referenda in four occupied parts of Ukraine, deported Ukrainians, bussed in Russians, held sham votes at gunpoint, and then manipulated the results to claim near unanimous support for joining the Russian Federation.

When President Putin couldn’t break the Ukrainian military, he intensified efforts to break Ukrainians’ spirit.  Over the last year, Russia has killed tens of thousands of Ukrainian men, women, and children; uprooted more than 13 million people from their homes; destroyed more than half of the country’s energy grid; bombed more than 700 hospitals, 2,600 schools; and abducted at least 6,000 Ukrainian children – some as young as four months old – and relocated them to Russia.

And yet, the spirit of the Ukrainians remains unbroken; if anything, it’s stronger than ever.

When Ukraine launched a counteroffensive that retook large swaths of its territory, President Putin conscripted an additional 300,000 men – throwing more and more of Russia’s young people into a meat grinder of his own making.  And he unleashed the Wagner Group – mercenaries who have committed atrocities from Africa to the Middle East, and now, in Ukraine.

Of course, that’s not the whole story of the last year.

There is also the story of Ukraine’s people.  Vastly outnumbered, they have fought bravely to defend their nation, their freedom, the right to determine their own future.  And they’ve demonstrated inspiring unity in helping one another endure Moscow’s relentless assault.

Teachers and community members give classes in bunkers to children.  City workers improvise patches to restore heat and power and water to residents.  Neighbors set up soup kitchens to feed the hungry.

There’s also the story of how the international community has come together.

The vast majority of member-states have voted multiple times to condemn Russia’s violations of the UN Charter and reject its illegal attempt to seize Ukrainian territory.  Yesterday, 141 countries voted in the General Assembly for a resolution that reaffirms the core principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity, denounces Russia’s atrocities, expresses support for a just and comprehensive peace, in accordance with the United Nations Charter.

When President Putin tried to weaponize hunger – exploiting the worst global food crisis since the creation of the UN – the international community responded swiftly.

Since the United States chaired a Food Security meeting last May, more than 100 countries have signed onto a set of concrete commitments to alleviate hunger.  Thanks in large part to the Secretary-General Guterres and Türkiye, the Black Sea Grain Initiative loosened Russia’s stranglehold on Ukraine’s ports and brought down the cost of grain for the world.  Now, as Moscow again tries to throttle its output, we have to ensure that that initiative is extended and expanded.

When President Putin tried to weaponize energy, we redirected natural gas supplies from across the world, so that countries Russia targeted could keep their people warm in the winter.  And Europe took extraordinary steps to end its dependence on Russian energy.

No country has endured greater hardship from Russia’s war than Ukraine, but almost every country has felt the pain.  And yet, nations around the world continue to stand with Ukraine.  Because we all recognize that if we abandon Ukraine, we abandon the UN Charter itself, and the principles and rules that make all countries safer and more secure.

No seizing land by force.

No erasing another country’s borders.

No targeting civilians in war.

No wars of aggression.

If we do not defend these basic principles, we invite a world in which might makes right, the strong dominate the weak.  That’s the world this body was created to end.  And members of this council have a unique responsibility to make sure that we do not return to it.  We can do that in three ways.

First, we must push for a just and durable peace.

Now I expect that many countries will call for peace today.

No one wants peace more than the Ukrainian people.  And the United States has long made clear – even before this war – that we’re prepared to engage in any meaningful diplomatic effort to stop Russia’s aggression against Ukraine.

But history teaches us that it’s the nature of peace that matters.

For peace to be just, it must uphold the principles at the heart of the UN Charter: sovereignty, territorial integrity, independence.

For peace to be durable, it must ensure that Russia can’t simply rest, rearm, and relaunch the war in a few months or a few years.

Any peace that legitimizes Russia’s seizure of land by force will weaken the charter and send a message to would-be aggressors everywhere that they can invade countries and get away with it.

President Zelenskyy has put forward a ten-point plan for a just and durable peace.  President Putin, by contrast, has made clear that there is nothing to talk about until Ukraine accepts, and I quote, “the new territorial realities,” while doubling down on his brutal tactics.

Members of this council have a fundamental responsibility to ensure that any peace is just and durable.

Council members should not be fooled by calls for a temporary or unconditional ceasefire.  Russia will use any pause in fighting to consolidate control over the territory it’s illegally seized and replenish its forces for further attacks.  That’s what happened when Russia’s first assault on Ukraine froze in 2015.  Look at what followed.

And members of this council should not fall into the false equivalency of calling on both sides to stop fighting, or calling on other nations to stop supporting Ukraine in the name of peace.

No member of this council should call for peace while supporting Russia’s war on Ukraine and on the UN Charter.

In this war, there is an aggressor and there is a victim.

Russia fights for conquest.  Ukraine fights for its freedom.

If Russia stops fighting and leaves Ukraine, the war ends.  If Ukraine stops fighting, Ukraine ends.

The fact remains:  One man – Vladimir Putin – started this war; one man can end it.

Second, even as we work to end Russia’s war against Ukraine, members of this council must continue to address other challenges to international peace and security.

We hear the concerns of countries who worry that standing with Ukraine and holding Russia accountable is diverting focus and resources from others in need.

To those countries, I would say, simply, look at our actions.

And when you hear Russia and its defenders accuse the countries who support Ukraine of ignoring the rest of the world – I say look at Moscow’s actions.

Compare the numbers.  In addition to the $13.5 billion in food aid that the United States contributed to fight hunger over the last year, we also fund more than 40 percent of the World Food Program’s budget.  Russia contributes less than 1 percent of that budget.

That’s not an outlier.  Based on the latest UN figures, the United States donates over nine times as much as Russia to UN peacekeeping.  We donate 390 times as much as Russia to UNICEF.  We give nearly a thousand times as much as Russia to the UN Refugee Agency.

Third, we must reaffirm our commitment to upholding what the UN Charter calls, and I quote, “the dignity and worth of the human person.”

We must continue to compile evidence of Russia’s ongoing and widespread atrocities, including executions; torture; rape and sexual violence; the deportation of thousands of Ukrainian civilians to Russia.

We must continue to document Russia’s war crimes and crimes against humanity, and share this evidence with investigators and prosecutors, so that one day, the perpetrators can be held accountable.

Day after day of Russia’s atrocities, it’s easy to become numb to the horror, to lose our ability to feel shock and outrage.  But we can never let the crimes Russia is committing become our new normal.

Bucha is not normal.  Mariupol is not normal.  Irpin is not normal.  Bombing schools and hospitals and apartment buildings to rubble is not normal.  Stealing Ukrainian children from their families and giving them to people in Russia is not normal.

We must not let President Putin’s callous indifference to human life become our own.

We must force ourselves to remember that behind every atrocity in this wretched war, in conflicts around the world, is a human being.

I recently visited an exhibit of artwork made by Ukrainian children affected by the war.

One painting I saw was made by a ten-year-old girl named Veronika.  Last April, Russian forces shelled her home in Vuhledar, killing her whole family.  When first responders dug her from the rubble, a piece of shrapnel was lodged in her skull.  Her left thumb had been ripped off.  Doctors saved her life, but the attack left her right hand mostly paralyzed, and she can’t see out of her left eye.

In her painting, Veronika drew herself in a bright pink and orange dress, holding a bouquet of flowers.  A building stands next to her.  When asked who lived there, she said it was a place where all the people she knew who had been killed in the war could be safe.

“We the peoples of the United Nations determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war…” That’s how the UN Charter begins.

Fellow members of this council:  Now is the time to meet that promise.  There are so many people in Ukraine who want the same thing as that little girl, Veronika: a world where they can live in peace, in their own country, and keep the people they love safe.

We have the power, we have the responsibility to create that world, today and for generations to come.  We cannot – we will not – let one country destroy it.

Thank you.

Special Briefing

Brussels Media Hub

October 10, 2023

MODERATOR: Good afternoon from the U.S. Department’s Brussels Media Hub. I would like to welcome everyone joining us today for this virtual press briefing. We’re very honored to be joined by Ambassador Julianne Smith, the U.S. permanent representative to NATO. Before I turn it over to the ambassador for opening remarks, I have a few comments on the procedure for asking questions. If you’re dailing by phone, you can join the questions queue by pressing *9 at any time. If you are joining us via the Zoom application or link, you may submit your questions at any time by clicking on the questions and Answers tab and typing in your question. If you see a colleague ask a question you like Ambassador Smith to cover, you can upload it in the queue by clicking the like button to the right of that question. If you’d like to ask your question live, you can click the erase hand icon at the bottom of the window. We will try to get to as many questions as possible in the 30 minutes that we have today. So please show your support and like the questions you most like us to cover. As always, you can notify us of any technical difficulties at theBrusselsHub@tate.gov. With that, let’s get started. Ambassador Smith, thank you so much for joining us today. I’ll turn it over to you for opening remarks.

AMBASSADOR SMITH: Well, thank you very much. Thanks to the Brussels Media Hub for facilitating this hub call today, this interview. Always helpful to have this check in before a Defense Ministerial and the UDCG (Ukraine Defense Contact Group). Let me first though, start by acknowledging just the unspeakable, tragic, tragic attacks, terrible events in Israel last few days. And let me echo the comments of President Biden. The United States unequivocally condemns the appalling assault against Israel by Hamas terrorists from Gaza, and the United States has made clear to Prime Minister Netanyahu that we stand ready to offer all appropriate means of support to the government and the people of Israel. Terrorism is never justified. But of course, as I mentioned, the reason that we’re here today is to preview both the Defense Ministerial that’s coming up very quickly as well as the Ukraine Defense Contact Group that will begin tomorrow. I want to also just say a few words about a recent trip we had with all of the NATO’s perm reps. We went to both Norfolk and Washington about two weeks ago, and I’ll say a few words about that trip maybe first.

We had a series of high level engagements across Washington with National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, with Secretary of State Tony Blinken. We were able to meet Deputy Secretary of Defense Kath Hicks, as well as a whole array of other high level officials. We also were able to spend some time in Congress, which was very important. We were able to take the group to both the House and the Senate to get perspectives on Ukraine support and also their views on the NATO alliance and the upcoming Washington summit next summer. And then, of course, we were able to go to Allied Command Transformation in Norfolk and go to Joint Forces Command, which is in Norfolk as well. I would say it was an extremely productive trip, but in relation to what’s transpired in the United States in recent days, I think it was important for the group to hear directly from members of Congress about the bipartisan support for our assistance to Ukraine. The message that came across loud and clear was that the United States will continue to support Ukraine for as long as it takes. And I think our allies appreciated hearing that message in stereo surround sound. Similarly, I think it was also important for our friends in Europe and in Canada to ensure that all of the interlocutors had a deep appreciation for all that Europe and Canada are doing for Ukraine as individual allies. There have been unprecedented levels of economic, humanitarian assistance, security assistance. Many of them are housing refugees, some of them millions of refugees, as you all know. And European allies have increased their defense budgets over the last two years. They’ve led on training Ukrainian pilots on the F-16 planes, and they’ve transferred a whole series of critical weapons systems to Ukraine that are really making a difference on the battlefield. So we wanted to ensure that we could have a conversation with American interlocutors. Many of them are fully aware of those contributions. But for anybody who wasn’t tracking the depth of support, I think it was an important opportunity for NATO to stand together, both in Washington and Norfolk and talk about those those contributions.

Now, let’s pivot quickly to what’s happening here at NATO’s headquarters this week. We will be welcoming, obviously, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, but also the new chairman of the Joint Chiefs, we’ll have General CQ Brown here to join us for the UDCG and of course the Defense Ministerial here in Brussels as well. As you all know, the UDCG is an important opportunity for over 50 countries to come together on a monthly basis, to sit down with our friends in Ukraine, hear about their current requirements and then move out on meeting those commitments. I suspect what you’re going to hear in this UDCG is a continued emphasis on both air defense and ammunition, as well as an array of other systems that they currently need. But those two categories will probably take precedence above many of the other things that they will be turning to the 50 countries for in the coming weeks and months.

On the DMM, I think this will be what’s important about this DMM is, it’s the first Defense Ministerial where we are going to be able to hold a NATO-Ukraine Council. This of course is a new development, something that was rolled out with the Vilnius Summit just a couple of months ago. Ukraine will actually sit in that meeting as an equal with NATO allies to work on a variety of issues, looking at how we can cooperate better on everything from cyber defense to combating disinformation or even Ukraine’s aspirations for NATO membership.

Now lastly, while the alliance is certainly more united than ever before on confronting a variety of shared security challenges, we had expected to be confronting these challenges as an alliance of 32 and not 31. As I have said before, we believe in the United States Sweden is ready to join the alliance, it is ready to do so today. They are already a committed partner and invitee. They are ready to be a committed, full fledged ally. They will no doubt make the alliance stronger and safer and more secure. And we believe that it is time for Hungary and Türkiye to honor their commitments and complete the ratification process in order to have Sweden join the alliance as soon as possible.

So with that, that gives you a little bit of a sense of what will be focused on here this week at NATO headquarters. And I’m looking forward to taking your questions.

MODERATOR: Thank you, Ambassador, for those opening remarks. We will now turn to the questions and answer portion of today’s briefing. As a reminder, you may type in your question in any time in the Q&A tab, raise your hand or dial *9
if you are dialed in. Let’s, first question will go to pre submitted question from Elina Kervinen from the Helsingin Sanomat in Finland: The Hamas attack has turned all eyes to Israel. What kind of discussion do you expect on this subject in the meeting and do you expect this new escalation to have any effect when it comes to supporting Ukraine?

AMBASSADOR SMITH: I guess I’ll work backwards in that regard. On the question of whether or not U.S. support for Israel could possibly come at the expense of U.S. support for Ukraine, we don’t anticipate any major challenges in that regard. The U.S. has had a long standing commitment to Israel’s security. We will continue to meet that commitment and in fact, as you heard from senior levels of the Biden administration, including from the President himself, we are going to look at additional steps we might take. You’ve no doubt heard the news that the United States is moving the USS Gerald R. Ford closer to Israel as a deterrent. He’s asked his team to look at additional measures. I suspect the United States will be able to stay focused on our partnership and commitment to Israel’s security, while also meeting our commitments and promise to continue supporting Ukraine as it defends its territory and protects and all of the values that all of us hold dear here across the NATO alliance.

MODERATOR: Thank you.

AMBASSADOR SMITH: Oh, was there another question, I think. Oh, so there was, sorry. There was the first question, which was the degree to which Israel will be part of the conversations here at the Defense Ministerial. I don’t have specific details to share with you. I think allies, no doubt will want to talk about what happened in Israel and express their solidarity. We’ve seen all members of the alliance issue their own national statements really in real time, almost as the attack was was ongoing, and I suspect that will be part of our conversation. Stay tuned for any additional details on that particular subject.

MODERATOR: Thank you, Ambassador. And we’ll go to a live question now: Mehmet Krasniqi from RTV Dukagjini Nikki. Mehmet, your mike is open.

QUESTION: Hi Mrs Ambassador, I am Mehmet Krasniqi from Dukagjini Radio and Television. I hope you hear me. You are probably aware of reports that the terrorist group responsible for the 24th of September attacks used Serbia military bases for trainings. Are you aware of this information and what’s your comments about it? And Hezbollah? Are you waiting for a NATO official to brought this issue up with Serbian officials? Thank you.

AMBASSADOR SMITH: I don’t have anything to share on that particular incident that you’re mentioning. I will say we have all been here at NATO HQ, all the allies closely monitoring the situation on the ground in the Western Balkans. We have been concerned about increasing signs of instability and some flashpoints where we’ve seen an uptick in violence, as a result KFOR took the decision in recent days to draw from some of its strategic reserve forces. We now have had a plus up of our forces of a few hundred coming primarily from the United Kingdom and Romania. We will continue to message our friends in the region that the only path forward to normalization is through the EU led facilitated dialog, which is strongly supported across the NATO alliance. We will continue to work with SACEUR to see if he believes anything additional should be required for NATO forces on the ground in Kosovo. I know he is looking at whether or not KFOR has the right level of capabilities and readiness to prepare, to handle any potential contingencies. But that is an area of focus for the alliance, and we will continue to look at that region and urge de-escalation.

MODERATOR: Thank you, ma’am. We’ll go to another pre-selected question. We had a number of questions following this line. Alexander Ward from Politico. Admiral Rob Bauer recently said NATO allies could see the “bottom of the barrel” of weapon supplies to send to Ukraine. Does the United States agree with that assessment?

AMBASSADOR SMITH: I think what we’ve seen across the alliance is a number of countries individually have really moved heaven and earth to give everything they possibly can to the Ukrainian people so that they can ensure that they have what they need to defend their territory. Situations obviously vary from one country to another. We have some countries that are prepared to give more. We have some member states that have noted that they’ve given a lot and they want to ensure that they can also maintain their own national defense. But in those cases, those countries have looked for creative ways to address some of their backfill requirements so that they could find more to give. Some countries are also purchasing assets and weapons that they might be able to donate. And we’ve seen a number of countries around the world step forward and offer backfill support to those allies that are providing security assistance. So again, they can find some additional ways to support Ukraine. So I think we will come out of the UDCG this week with additional forms of assistance. We will see allies continuing to look for ways to meet those urgent requirements that the Ukrainians are putting on the table. And most importantly, NATO here has all of the allies here at NATO have been focused on increasing production in our own countries across Europe, working in some cases multilaterally, bilaterally, to find ways to get those production lines, to produce some of the capabilities that are required at a faster clip. So this is all part of an effort here at NAITO to ensure that NATO allies have what they need for their national defense, can continue to find ways to support Ukraine, and showcase alliance solidarity as we stand with the people of Ukraine.

MODERATOR: Thank you, Ambassador. We’ll go to another submitted question, this time from Andre Popescu from Panorama. How worried is the alliance about the Russian drone attacks taking place at the border of Romania targeting Ukrainian Danube harbours, some of them violating Romanian airspace or possibly crashing in Romanian territory. Are there any precautionary measures or reactions that NATO is taking to tackle this issue?

AMBASSADOR SMITH: Well, we’ve been in close contact with our friends in Romania to better understand what’s happening, what has happened to date, and how we might all provide additional vigilance activities that would help them protect their territory. The Alliance has undertaken a series of steps since Russia went into Ukraine last year to reinforce the eastern flank. We now have allied troops that are present inside Romania addressing their very legitimate and real security concerns. Obviously, in light of some of these drone incidents, SACEUR has been looking at ways to again enhance vigilance activities. So that we can monitor these events, better understand them and hopefully deter them. We have warned the Russians about these types of incidents and will continue to do so. But when we say that we are here to protect every inch of NATO’s territory, we mean it. And we’ve undertaken a series of steps to ensure that we can do so.

MODERATOR: Thank you, ma’am. Going to a question from Reuters in Turkey, Tuvan Gumrukcu. Have Turkish officials provided you with any timeline regarding the ratification of Sweden’s NATO bid? If this process were to be delayed any further, what sort of implications would this have on U.S.-Turkey ties? Would it in any way affect Ankara’s procurement of F-16s and modernization kits from the United States?

AMBASSADOR SMITH: Well, the timeline that was offered was really what we heard from President Erdogan himself, when we were all at the Vilnius summit last summer in July. And at that time, he said that he believed Sweden had addressed all of Türkiye’s concerns and that he personally was ready to move out and move forward with the process of ratification. That was complicated to do at the time because the parliament inside Türkiye was getting ready to head into recess. So there was an acknowledgment that this would likely happen sometime in October. I think what Türkiye has heard from all of the Allies is that we very much hope that this process now will move forward with great speed and urgency. We obviously are eager to have Sweden sit at the table as a full fledged member. This isn’t just a question of Sweden’s security, although that’s a big part of it. They obviously are interested in finalizing membership as soon as possible, but this is also a question of Alliance security. It won’t surprise you to hear that many of our friends in the Baltic States and in that particular region, the Nordic Baltic region, are also very interested in ensuring that Sweden become a member as soon as possible. So this is a matter for all of us. It would mean a great deal to get this done as soon as possible because we are in the process of implementing and executing NATO’s new regional plans, that were just rolled out at the Vilnius summit. So I think we anticipate that this will happen sooner rather than later. We have worked closely with our friends in Hungary and Türkiye to make sure that they understand the urgency, and we very much hope that President Erdogan will deliver on the pledge that he made in Vilnius.

MODERATOR: Thank you, Ambassador. Question from Paul McLeary, Politico. Is NATO’s taking a new look at Black Sea security, particularly boosting the naval or air defense capabilities of allies who border the Black Sea?

AMBASSADOR SMITH: Right now, we are for all the obvious reasons. Clearly, the Black Sea is an area that we’re monitoring quite closely, in particular because of what we mentioned earlier, some of these incidents with drones landing or breaking up over Romanian territory. So this has been a focus for the alliance. We’ve looked at it closely. There are air policing missions close to that particular neighborhood, and we are looking to fill any existing gaps that exist in NATO’s air policing missions in the neighborhood. It will continue to be an area that we monitor quite closely, and all of us are very focused on trying to find ways to get the grain out of Ukraine now that Russia has decided to kill the Black Sea Grain Initiative. We’re looking at additional routes down through the Danube and overland. Unfortunately, those routes are not so well developed as to replicate exactly what we were able to get out through the Black Sea itself. But we’re looking to expand those routes as fast as possible. And lastly, I’ll say we really salute our friends in Türkiye and for the efforts that they have undertaken not only to establish the Black Sea Grain Initiative when it was first created last year, but their recent efforts to try and get it back online.

MODERATOR: Thank you, ma’am. I think we have time for one more question, going to Zoriana Stepanenko, RFE/RL’s Ukrainian Service. The Ukrainian Defense Contact Group, what will they be focused on tomorrow, given the most urgent needs of Ukraine? What kind of military aid can be expected, given also the current capacities of Allies and partners united in a so-called Rammstein format?

AMBASSADOR SMITH: Well, as I said at the top, I anticipate that the emphasis will be mostly on air defense and ammunition, although no doubt the Ukrainians will come in with a variety of other requests. I can’t say with certainty what will come out of the actual meeting. It always is an organic meeting where ministers step forward and offer assistance in real time, and in some cases we hear about that for the first time in the UDCG. So we cannot predict exactly what will happen. But I say air defense and ammunition really for two reasons. One, because those sets of capabilities are still very important for the battles that the Ukrainians are fighting today, but also air defense in particular is going to be critical during those winter months where we have seen the Russians rely on indiscriminate attacks on civilian infrastructure, critical infrastructure to try and plunge the Ukrainian people into cold and darkness. We want to make sure that the Ukrainians this winter have the air defense assets they need to harden those critical infrastructure nodes and ensure that Russian efforts to leave Ukrainians in the dark and cold are ultimately unsuccessful. So that air defense component, very, very important for now and later. And that’s why I suspect you’ll see a special emphasis placed on air defense when all the ministers meet tomorrow.

MODERATOR: Thank you, Ambassador. I’m afraid that’s all the time we have for today. Thanks everyone, for your questions, and thank you, Ambassador Smith, for taking the time to join us. Before we close the call, I turn it back to you quickly for any final thoughts.

AMBASSADOR SMITH: Well, just thanks again for everybody’s interest in checking in before the DMM and the UDCG. We’re looking forward to this meeting. I think it comes at a wonderful time to signal to the Russians in particular, but also the people of Ukraine that our support collectively remains unwavering. And we will continue to find important ways to support Ukraine in the months ahead.

MODERATOR: Thank you.

Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State

Helsinki City Hall

Helsinki, Finland

June 2, 2023

MAYOR VARTIAINEN:  Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, dear friends, it is my great pleasure to warmly welcome you all to the beautiful capital of Finland, Helsinki, and the Helsinki City Hall.  Helsinki has a great honor to host this special event today.  We are humbled and in great appreciation to have the U.S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken here in Helsinki.

Helsinki is a city where the harmonious blend of history, innovation, freedom, and diplomacy converges.  Our capital is and has been an arena for numerous high-level meetings and political events, and we are proud to provide the platform for this historical moment, now for the first time as the proud capital of a new NATO Ally.

Now it is my great pleasure to introduce you the co-organizer of the event, Dr. Mika Aaltola, the director of the Finnish Institute of International Affairs.  Thank you.  (Applause.)

MR AALTOLA:  Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, this is a truly historical day.  It is the first time that a United States secretary of state stands on the solid granite ground of NATO Finland.  Secretary Blinken’s visit represents a new era in the Finnish-U.S. relations that have long historical ties.  Never before have the relations between our two countries been this close.

In addition to now being NATO Allies, Finland and the United States are working together to enhance our bilateral defense cooperation.  Also, economic cooperation has increased significantly as the U.S. became Finland’s number one trade partner last year.

While physically separated by an ocean, our countries are bound by ties that surpass distance.  We face common security challenges, but even more importantly, we share a belief in democracy, in our common values and shared interests.

These values are being challenged by Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine.  With the level of economic and military support it has offered to Ukraine, the United States remains the indispensable force in Europe.  The U.S. was already awake when most of Europe was still sleeping, relatively undisturbed by Russia’s power political gaming.  U.S. leadership is as needed as ever.

This leadership helps to keep doors open and enemies at bay, but there would be no leadership without a partnership.  This partnership is something that Finland has offered to the United States.  Finland is an able ally and a security provider.  We carry our responsibilities in our region and beyond, and we are committed to support Ukraine and to defend ourselves and the values we stand for.  This commitment is shared by the Finnish leadership but, even more importantly, by the Finnish people.

Finland has ranked as the least corrupt, most egalitarian, one of the most educated, and most democratic countries in the world.  It also is the most stable country in the world.  In these volatile times, this stability has a value of its own.  Surprisingly for many Finns, Finland is also the happiest country in the world.  We question this result every year, but it is pointed to us that it is the case.  It is a fact, so how miserable others must be if we are the happiest.  (Laughter.)

But now I’m truly happy to be able to welcome on the stage with United States Secretary of State Mr. Antony Blinken.  (Applause.)

SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  And yes, I feel a greater sense of happiness today than I’ve felt in a long time.  (Laughter.)

Mayor Vartiainen, thank you for hosting us here in Helsinki, and in this absolutely magnificent city hall.

And Mika, my thanks to you, and also to your entire team – all of the researchers at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs, for deepening the scholarship about diplomacy, and also enriching the public debate.

I’m also gratified that my friend and my partner, Pekka Haavisto, is here with us today.  We have worked so closely together over this past truly historic year, and I’m grateful for your presence.

To all of the distinguished guests, two months ago, I stood with our Allies in Brussels as Finland’s flag was raised over NATO headquarters for the first time.  President Niinistö declared, and I quote, “The era of military nonalignment in Finland has come to an end.  A new era begins.”

It was a sea change that would have been unthinkable a little more than a year earlier.  Before Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, one in four Finns supported the country joining NATO.  After the full-scale invasion, three in four Finns supported joining.

It wasn’t hard for Finns to imagine themselves in the Ukrainians’ shoes.  They’d walked in them in November 1939, when the Soviet Union invaded Finland.

Like President Putin’s so-called “special operation” against Ukraine, the USSR’s so-called “liberation operation” falsely accused Finland of provoking the invasion.

Like the Russians with Kyiv, the Soviets were confident that they’d sack Helsinki in weeks – so confident that they had Dmitri Shostakovich compose music for the victory parade, before the Winter War even started.

Like Putin in Ukraine, when Stalin failed to overcome the Finns’ fierce and determined resistance, he shifted to a strategy of terror, incinerating entire villages and bombing so many hospitals from the air that Finns started covering up the Red Cross insignia on the rooftops.

Like the millions of Ukrainian refugees today, hundreds of thousands of Finns were driven from their homes by the Soviet invasion.  They included two children, Pirkko and Henri, whose families evacuated their homes in Karelia – the mother and father of our host, the mayor of the city.

To many Finns, the parallels between 1939 and 2022 were striking.  They were visceral.  And they were not wrong.

Finns understood that if Russia violated the core principles of the UN Charter – sovereignty, territorial integrity, independence – if they did that in Ukraine, it will imperil their own peace and security as well.

We understood that, too.  That’s why, over the course of 2021, as Russia ratcheted up its threats against Kyiv and amassed more and more troops, tanks, and planes on Ukraine’s borders, we made every effort to get Moscow to de-escalate its manufactured crisis and resolve its issues through diplomacy.

President Biden told President Putin that we were prepared to discuss our mutual security concerns – a message that I reaffirmed repeatedly – including in person, with Foreign Minister Lavrov.  We offered written proposals to reduce tensions.  Together with our allies and partners, we used every forum to try to prevent war, from the NATO-Russia Council to the OSCE, from the UN to our direct channels.

Across these engagements, we set out two possible paths for Moscow: a path of diplomacy, which could lead to greater security for Ukraine, for Russia, for all of Europe; or a path of aggression, which would result in severe consequences for the Russian Government.

President Biden made clear that regardless of which path President Putin chose, we would be ready.  And if Russia chose war, we would do three things: support Ukraine, impose severe costs on Russia, and strengthen NATO while rallying our allies and partners around these goals.

As the storm clouds gathered, we surged military, economic, and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine.  First in August 2021, and again in December, we sent military equipment to bolster Ukraine’s defenses, including Javelins and Stingers.  And we deployed a team from the U.S. Cyber Command to help Ukraine shore up its power grid and other critical infrastructure against cyber attacks.

We prepared an unprecedented set of sanctions, export controls, other economic costs to impose severe and immediate consequences on Russia in the event of a full-scale invasion.

We took steps to leave no doubt that we, and our Allies, would uphold our commitment to defend every inch of NATO territory.

And we worked relentlessly to rally allies and partners around helping Ukraine defend itself and denying Putin his strategic aims.

Since day one of his administration, President Biden has focused on rebuilding and revitalizing America’s alliances and partnerships, knowing that we’re stronger when we work alongside those who share our interests and our values.

In the run-up to Russia’s invasion, we demonstrated the power of those partnerships – coordinating our planning and strategy for a potential invasion with NATO, with the EU, with the G7, and other allies and partners from around the world.

Over those fateful weeks in January and February of 2022, it became clear that no amount of diplomatic effort was going to change President Putin’s mind.  He would choose war.

And so, on February 17, 2022, I went before the United Nations Security Council to warn the world that Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine was imminent.

I set out the steps that Russia would take:  first manufacturing a pretext, and then using missiles, tanks, troops, cyber attacks to strike pre-identified targets, including Kyiv, with the aim of toppling Ukraine’s democratically elected government and erasing Ukraine from the map as an independent country.

We hoped – we hoped – to be proven wrong.

Unfortunately, we were right.  A week after my warning to the Security Council, President Putin invaded.  Ukrainians of all walks of life – soldiers and citizens, men and women, young and old – bravely defended their nation.

And the United States moved swiftly, decisively, and in unison with allies and partners to do exactly what we said we’d do: support Ukraine, impose costs on Russia, strengthen NATO – all of this with our allies and partners.

And with our collective support, Ukraine did what it said it would do: defended its territory, its independence, its democracy.

Today, what I want to do is set out this and the many other ways Putin’s war of aggression against Ukraine has been a strategic failure, greatly diminishing Russia’s power, its interests, and its influence for years to come.  And I’ll also share our vision of the path to a just and lasting peace.

When you look at President Putin’s long-term strategic aims and objectives, there is no question:  Russia is significantly worse off today than it was before its full-scale invasion of Ukraine – militarily, economically, geopolitically.

Where Putin aimed to project strength, he’s revealed weakness.  Where he sought to divide, he’s united.  What he tried to prevent, he’s precipitated.  That outcome is no accident. It’s the direct result of the courage and solidarity of the Ukrainian people and the deliberate, decisive, swift action that we and our partners have taken to support Ukraine.

First, for years, President Putin sought to weaken and divide NATO, under the false claim that it posed a threat to Russia.  In fact, before Russia invaded Crimea and eastern Ukraine in 2014, NATO’s posture reflected a shared conviction that conflict in Europe was unlikely.  The United States had significantly reduced its forces in Europe since the end of the Cold War, from 315,000 in 1989 to 61,000 at the end of 2013.  Many European countries’ spending on defense had been declining for years.  NATO’s strategic doctrine at the time labeled Russia a partner.

Following Russia’s invasion of Crimea and the Donbas in 2014, that tide began to turn.  Allies committed to spend two percent of GDP on defense and deployed new forces to NATO’s eastern flank in response to Russia’s aggression.   The Alliance has accelerated its transformation since Russia’s full-scale invasion – not to pose a threat or because NATO seeks conflict.  NATO always has been – and always will be – a defensive alliance.  But Russia’s aggression, threats, nuclear saber-rattling compelled us to reinforce our deterrence and defense.

Hours after the full-scale invasion, we activated NATO’s defensive Response Force. In the weeks that followed, several Allies – including the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, Spain, France – swiftly sent troops, aircraft, and ships to reinforce NATO’s eastern flank.  We doubled the number of ships patrolling the North and Baltic seas, and doubled the number of battle groups in the region.  The United States established its first permanent military presence in Poland.  And, of course, NATO added Finland as its 31st Ally, and we will soon add Sweden as the 32nd.

As we head into the NATO Summit in Vilnius, our shared message will be clear:  NATO Allies are committed to enhanced deterrence and defense, to greater and smarter defense spending, to deeper ties with Indo-Pacific partners.  NATO’s door remains open to new members, and it will stay open.

Russia’s invasion has also led the European Union to do more – and more together with the United States and with NATO – than ever before.  The EU and its member-states have provided over $75 billion in military, economic, humanitarian support to Ukraine.  That includes $18 billion in security assistance, from air defense systems to Leopard tanks to ammunition.  Coordinating closely with the U.S., the U.K., and other partners, the EU has launched its most ambitious sanctions ever, immobilizing over half of Russia’s sovereign assets.  And European nations have taken in more than 8 million Ukrainian refugees, most of whom have not only been granted access to public services, but also the right to work, to study.

Second, for decades, Moscow worked to deepen Europe’s dependence on Russian oil and gas.  Since President Putin’s full-scale invasion, Europe has made a swift and decisive turn away from Russian energy.  Berlin immediately canceled Nord Stream 2, which would have doubled the flow of Russian gas to Germany.

Before Putin’s invasion, European countries imported 37 percent of their natural gas from Russia.  Europe cut that by more than half in less than a year.  In 2022, EU countries generated a record one-fifth of their electricity through wind and solar – more electricity than the EU generated through coal, gas, or any other power source.  The United States for its part more than doubled our supply of gas to Europe, and our Asian allies – Japan, the Republic of Korea – also stepped up to boost Europe’s supply.

Meanwhile, the oil price cap that we and our G7 partners put in place has kept Russia’s energy in the global market, while dramatically cutting Russian revenues.  A year into its invasion, Russia’s oil revenues had fallen by 43 percent.  The Russian Government’s tax revenues from oil and gas have fallen by nearly two-thirds.  And Moscow will not get back the markets that it has lost in Europe.

Third, President Putin spent two decades trying to build Russia’s military into a modern force, with cutting-edge weaponry, streamlined command, and well-trained, well-equipped soldiers.  The Kremlin often claimed it had the second-strongest military in the world, and many believed it.  Today, many see Russia’s military as the second-strongest in Ukraine.  Its equipment, technology, leadership, troops, strategy, tactics, and morale, a case study in failure – even as Moscow inflicts devastating, indiscriminate, and gratuitous damage on Ukraine and Ukrainians.

Russia is estimated to have suffered more than 100,000 casualties in the last six months alone, as Putin sends wave after wave of Russians into a meat grinder of his own making.

Meanwhile, sanctions and export controls imposed by the United States, the European Union, and other partners around the world have severely degraded Russia’s war machine and defense exports, setting them back for years to come.  Russia’s global defense partners and customers can no longer count on promised orders, let alone spare parts.  And as they witness Russia’s poor performance on the battlefield, they are increasingly taking their business elsewhere.

Fourth, President Putin wanted to build Russia up as a global, economic power.  His invasion cemented his long-running failure to diversify Russia’s economy, to strengthen its human capital, to fully integrate the country into the global economy.  Today, Russia’s economy is a shadow of what it was, and a fraction of what it could have become had Putin invested in technology and innovation rather than weapons and war.

Russia’s foreign reserves are down by more than half, as are profits from its state-owned enterprises.  More than 1,700 foreign companies have reduced, suspended, or ended operations in Russia since the onset of the invasion.  That’s tens of thousands of jobs gone, a massive flight of foreign expertise, and billions of dollars in lost revenue for the Kremlin.

A million people have fled Russia, including many of the country’s top IT specialists, entrepreneurs, engineers, doctors, professors, journalists, scientists.  Countless artists, writers, filmmakers, musicians have also left, seeing no future for themselves in a country where they can’t express themselves freely.

Fifth, President Putin invested considerable effort to show that Russia could be a valued partner to China.  On the eve of the invasion, Beijing and Moscow declared a “no limits” partnership.  Eighteen months into the invasion, that two-way partnership looks more and more one-sided.  Putin’s aggression and weaponization of strategic dependencies on Russia has served as a wake-up call to governments around the world to make efforts at de-risking.  And together, the United States and our partners are taking steps to reduce those vulnerabilities, from building more resilient critical supply chains to strengthening our shared tools to counter economic coercion.

So, Russia’s aggression hasn’t distracted us from meeting the challenges in the Indo-Pacific.  It’s actually sharpened our focus on them.  And our support for Ukraine hasn’t weakened our capabilities to meet potential threats from China or anywhere else – it’s strengthened them. And we believe that Beijing is taking notice that, far from being intimidated by a forceful violation of the UN Charter, the world has rallied to defend it.

Sixth, prior to the war, President Putin regularly used Russia’s influence in international organizations to try to weaken the United Nations Charter.  Today, Russia is more isolated on the world stage than ever.  At least 140 nations – two-thirds of UN member-states – have repeatedly voted in the UN General Assembly to affirm Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, to reject Putin’s attempts to illegally annex Ukrainian territory, to condemn Russia’s aggression and atrocities, and to call for a peace consistent with the principles of the United Nations Charter.  Governments from the West and East, North and South have voted to suspend Russia from numerous institutions, from the UN Human Rights Council to the International Civil Aviation Organization.  Russian candidates have lost one election after another for key seats in international institutions, from the governing board of UNICEF to leadership of the UN agency responsible for information and communication technologies, the ITU.

Each rebuke and loss for Moscow is not only a vote against Russia’s aggression, it’s a vote for the core principles of the United Nations Charter.   And countries from every part of the world are supporting efforts to hold Russia accountable for its war crimes and crimes against humanity, from creating a special UN commission to document the crimes and human rights violations committed in Russia’s war to assisting investigations by prosecutors in Ukraine and at the International Criminal Court.

Seventh, President Putin, for years, sought to divide the West from the rest, claiming that Russia was advancing the best interests of the developing world.   Today, thanks to openly declaring his imperial ambitions and weaponizing food and fuel, President Putin has diminished Russian influence on every continent.  Putin’s efforts to reconstitute a centuries-old empire reminded every nation that had endured colonial rule and repression of their own pain.  Then, he exacerbated the economic hardship many nations were already experiencing due to COVID and climate change by cutting off Ukraine’s grain from the world markets, driving up the cost of food and fuel everywhere.

By contrast, on one global challenge after another, the United States and our partners have proven that our focus on Ukraine will not distract us from working to improve the lives of people around the world and address the cascading costs of Russia’s aggression.

Our unprecedented emergency food aid has prevented millions of people from starving to death. Just last year alone, the United States provided $13.5 billion in food assistance.  And the United States is currently funding over half of the UN World Food Programme’s budget.  Russia funds less than one percent.

We supported a deal negotiated by UN Secretary-General Guterres and Türkiye to break Russia’s stranglehold on Ukrainian grain, allowing 29 million tons of food and counting to get out of Ukraine and to people around the world.  That includes 8 million tons of wheat, which is the equivalent of roughly 16 billion loaves of bread.

Together with allies and partners, we’re mobilizing hundreds of billions of dollars in financing for high-quality infrastructure in the countries where it’s needed most and building it in a way that’s transparent, good for the environment; empowers local workers and communities.

We’re strengthening global health security, from training half a million health professionals in our own hemisphere, in the Americas, to helping the pharmaceutical company Moderna finalize plans with Kenya to build its first mRNA vaccine manufacturing facility in Africa.

Time and again, we are demonstrating who fuels global problems and who solves them.

Finally, President Putin’s core aim – indeed, his obsession – has been to erase the very idea of Ukraine – its identity, its people, its culture, its agency, its territory.  But here, too, Putin’s actions have precipitated the opposite effect.  No one has done more to strengthen Ukraine’s national identity than the man who sought to wipe it out.  No one has done more to deepen Ukrainians’ unity and solidarity.  No one has done more to intensify Ukrainians’ determination to write their own future on their own terms.

Ukraine will never be Russia.  Ukraine stands sovereign, independent, firmly in control of its own destiny.  In this – Putin’s primary goal – he has failed most spectacularly.

President Putin constantly claims that the United States, Europe, and countries that support Ukraine are bent on defeating or destroying Russia, on toppling its government, on holding back its people.  That is false. We do not seek the overthrow of the Russian Government and we never have.  Russia’s future is for Russians to decide.

We have no quarrel with the Russian people, who had no say in starting this tragic war.  We lament that Putin is sending tens of thousands of Russians to their deaths in a war he could end now, if he chose – and inflicting ruinous impact on Russia’s economy and its prospects.  Indeed, it must be asked:  How has Putin’s war improved the lives, the livelihoods, or the prospects of ordinary Russian citizens?

Everything that we and our allies and partners do in response to Putin’s invasion has the same purpose: to help Ukraine defend its sovereignty, its territorial integrity and independence, and to stand up for the international rules and principles that are threatened by Putin’s ongoing war.

Let me say this directly to the Russian people:  The United States is not your enemy.  At the peaceful end of the Cold War, we shared the hope that Russia would emerge to a brighter future, free and open, fully integrated with the world.  For more than 30 years, we worked to pursue stable and cooperative relations with Moscow, because we believed that a peaceful, secure, and prosperous Russia is in America’s interests – indeed, in the interests of the world.  We still believe that today.

We cannot choose your future for you, and we won’t try to do so.  But we also will not let President Putin impose his will on other nations.  Moscow must treat the independence, the sovereignty, the territorial integrity of its neighbors with the same respect that it demands for Russia.

Now, as I’ve made clear, by virtually every measure, President Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has been a strategic failure.  Yet while Putin has failed to achieve his aims, he hasn’t given up on them.  He’s convinced that he can simply outlast Ukraine and its supporters, sending more and more Russians to their deaths, inflicting more and more suffering on Ukraine’s civilians.  He thinks that even if he loses the short game, he can still win the long game.  Putin is wrong about this, too.

The United States – together with our allies and partners – is firmly committed to supporting Ukraine’s defense today, tomorrow, for as long as it takes.  And in America, this support is bipartisan.  And precisely because we have no illusions about Putin’s aspirations, we believe the prerequisite for meaningful diplomacy and real peace is a stronger Ukraine, capable of deterring and defending against any future aggression.

We’ve rallied a formidable team around this effort.  With Secretary of Defense Austin’s leadership, more than 50 countries are cooperating through the Ukraine Defense Contact Group.  And we’re leading by the power of our example, providing tens of billions of dollars in security assistance to Ukraine with robust and unwavering support from both sides of the aisle in our Congress.

Today, America and our allies and partners are helping meet Ukraine’s needs on the current battlefield while developing a force that can deter and defend against aggression for years to come.  That means helping build a Ukrainian military of the future, with long-term funding, a strong air force centered on modern combat aircraft, an integrated air and missile defense network, advanced tanks and armored vehicles, national capacity to produce ammunition, and the training and support to keep forces and equipment combat-ready.

That also means Ukraine’s membership in NATO will be a matter for Allies and Ukraine – not Russia – to decide.  The path to peace will be forged not only through Ukraine’s long-term military strength, but also the strength of its economy and its democracy. This is at the heart of our vision for the way forward:  Ukraine must not only survive, it must thrive.  To be strong enough to deter and defend against aggressors beyond its borders, Ukraine needs a vibrant, prosperous democracy within its borders.

That’s the path the Ukrainian people voted for when they won their independence in 1991.  It’s the choice they defended in the Maidan in 2004, and again in 2013: a free and open society, with respect for human rights and the rule of law, fully integrated with Europe, where all Ukrainians have dignity and the opportunity to realize their full potential – and where the government responds to the needs of its people, not those of vested interests and elites.

We are committed to working with allies and partners to help Ukrainians make their vision a reality.  We’ll not only help Ukraine rebuild its economy, but reimagine it, with new industries, trade routes, supply chains connected with Europe and with markets around the world.  We’ll continue to bolster Ukraine’s independent anti-corruption bodies, a free and vibrant press, civil society organizations.  We’ll help Ukraine overhaul its energy grid – more than half of which has been destroyed by Russia – and do it in a way that’s cleaner, more resilient, and more integrated with its neighbors, so that Ukraine can one day become an energy exporter.

Ukraine’s greater integration with Europe is vital to all of these efforts.  Kyiv took a giant step in that direction last June, when the union formally granted Ukraine EU candidate status.  And Kyiv is working to make progress toward the EU’s benchmarks even as it fights for its survival.

Investing in Ukraine’s strength is not at the expense of diplomacy.  It paves the way for diplomacy.  President Zelenskyy has said repeatedly that diplomacy is the only way to end this war, and we agree.  In December, he put forward a vision for a just and lasting peace.  Instead of engaging on that proposal or even offering one of his own, President Putin has said there is nothing to talk about until Ukraine accepts, and I quote, “new territorial realities” – in other words, accept Russia’s seizure of 20 percent of Ukraine’s territory.  Putin spent the winter trying to freeze Ukrainian civilians to death, and then the spring trying to bomb them to death.  Day after day, Russia rains down missiles and drones on Ukrainian apartment buildings, schools, hospitals.

Now, from a distance, it’s easy to become numb to these and other Russian atrocities, like the drone strike last week on a medical clinic in Dnipro, which killed four people, including doctors; or the 17 strikes on Kyiv in the month of May alone, many using hypersonic missiles; or the missile attack in April on the city of Uman – hundreds of miles from the front lines – in which 23 civilians were killed.  The rocket strike hit multiple apartment buildings in Uman before dawn.  In one of those buildings, a father, Dmytro, raced to the room where his children were sleeping – Kyrylo, age 17; Sophia, age 11.  But when he opened the door to their bedroom, there was no room, just fire and smoke.  His children were gone.  Two more innocent lives extinguished.  Two of the six children Russia killed in a single strike.  Two of the thousands of Ukrainian children killed by Russia’s war of aggression.  Thousands more have been wounded, and thousands beyond that have been abducted from their families by Russia and given to Russian families.  Millions have been displaced.  All are part of a generation of Ukrainian children terrorized, traumatized, scarred by Putin’s war of aggression, all of whom remind us why Ukrainians are so fiercely committed to defending their nation and why they deserve – deserve – a just and lasting peace.

Now, some have argued that if the United States truly wanted peace, we’d stop supporting Ukraine, and then if Ukraine truly wanted to end the war, it would just cut its losses and give up the fifth of its territory that Russia illegally occupies.  Let’s play this out for a minute.  What neighbors of Russia would feel confident in their own sovereignty and territorial integrity if Putin’s aggression were to be rewarded with a fifth of Ukraine’s territory?

And for that matter, how would any country that lives near a bully, with a history of threats and aggression, feel secure within its own borders?   What lesson will other would-be aggressors around the world learn if Putin is allowed to violate a core tenet of the UN Charter with impunity?   And how often in history have aggressors who seize all or part of a neighboring country been satisfied and stopped there?  When has that ever satisfied Vladimir Putin?

The United States has been working with Ukraine – and allies and partners around the world – to build consensus around the core elements of a just and lasting peace.  To be clear, the United States welcomes any initiative that helps bring President Putin to the table to engage in meaningful diplomacy.  We’ll support efforts – whether by Brazil, by China, or any other nation – if they help find a way to a just and lasting peace, consistent with the principles of the United Nations Charter.

Here’s what that means.

A just and lasting peace must uphold the UN Charter and affirm the principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity, and independence.

A just and lasting peace requires Ukraine’s full participation and assent – nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.

A just and lasting peace must support Ukraine’s reconstruction and recovery, with Russia paying its share.

A just and lasting peace must address both accountability and reconciliation.

A just and lasting peace can open a pathway to sanctions relief connected to concrete actions, especially military withdrawal.  A just and lasting peace must end Russia’s war of aggression.

Now, over the coming weeks and months, some countries will call for a ceasefire.  And on the surface, that sounds sensible – attractive, even.  After all, who doesn’t want warring parties to lay down their arms?  Who doesn’t want the killing to stop?

But a ceasefire that simply freezes current lines in place and enables Putin to consolidate control over the territory he’s seized, and then rest, re-arm, and re-attack – that is not a just and lasting peace.  It’s a Potemkin peace.  It would legitimize Russia’s land grab.  It would reward the aggressor and punish the victim.

If and when Russia is ready to work for true peace, the United States will respond in concert with Ukraine and other allies and partners around the world.  And along with Ukraine and allies and partners, we would be prepared to have a broader discussion on European security that promotes stability and transparency and reduces the likelihood of future conflict.

In the weeks and months ahead, the United States will continue to work with Ukraine, with our allies and partners – and any and all parties dedicated to supporting a just and lasting peace based on these principles.

On April 4, 1949, 74 years to the day before Finland joined NATO, the original members of the Alliance gathered in Washington to sign its founding treaty.  President Truman warned the group, and I quote, “We cannot succeed if our people are haunted by the constant fear of aggression and burdened by the cost of preparing their nations individually against attack.  [W]e hope to create a shield against aggression and the fear of aggression – a bulwark which will permit us to get on with the real business of . . . achieving a fuller and happier life for all our citizens.”

The same is true today.  No nation – not Ukraine, not the United States, not Finland, Sweden, any other country can deliver for its people if it lives in constant fear of aggression.  That’s why we’ve all got a stake in ensuring that President Putin’s war of aggression against Ukraine continues to be a strategic failure.

In his New Year’s address to the Finnish people, President Niinistö identified one of the fundamental flaws of President Putin’s plan to swiftly conquer Ukraine – a flaw that also doomed Stalin’s plan to swiftly conquer Finland.  As President Niinistö said, and I quote, “As leaders of a country under authoritarian rule, Stalin and Putin failed to recognize . . . that people living in a free country have their own will and convictions.  And that a nation that works together constitutes an immense force.”

Finns have a word for that fierce combination of will and determination: sisu.  And they recognize sisu in the struggle of Ukrainians today.  And when a free people like the Ukrainians have at their backs the support of free nations around the world – nations who recognize their fates and freedom – their rights and security are inextricably bound together, the force they possess is not merely immense.  It is unstoppable.

Thank you very much.  (Applause.)

NATO Headquarters

Brussels, Belgium

November 13, 2024

SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Well, good morning, everyone.  First, it’s a pleasure as always to be back at NATO.  We had very good discussions with the secretary general, Mark Rutte – delighted to see him at the helm of the Alliance in this critical moment – as well as with all of our NATO colleagues at the North Atlantic Council.

The purpose of this visit is to focus our efforts on ensuring that Ukraine has the money, the munitions, and the mobilized forces to fight effectively in 2025 or to be able to negotiate a peace from a position of strength.  And this is a critical moment because we see, first, the ongoing Russian onslaught against Ukraine in the east as well as against civilians, against critical energy infrastructure.  We see now the introduction of North Korean forces into the fight, and this is a profound and incredibly dangerous development in two ways – first, of course, because it’s adding fuel to the fire for Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, and that’s of deep concern to everyone around the NATO table.  But it’s also a two-way street.  The relationship between Russia and North Korea is working in both directions, and there is deep concern about what Russia is or may be doing to strengthen North Korea’s capacities – its missile capacity, its nuclear capacity – as well as the experience that the North Korean forces are getting in their efforts to support Russia against Ukraine.

So there is a clear commitment that this gets – and it will get – a firm response from the Alliance, from many countries that are concerned both in the Euro-Atlantic theater and in the Indo-Pacific.

As we’re working to make sure that Ukraine has what it needs to effectively defend itself, the United States continues to step up.  We’ve obligated just recently and pushed out the door another $8 billion in security assistance for Ukraine – that was in September, another almost half a billion dollars just a few weeks ago, and President Biden has committed to making sure that every dollar we have at our disposal will be pushed out the door between now and January 20th.  We’re making sure that Ukraine has the air defenses it needs, that has the artillery it needs, that has the armored vehicles it needs.

But as always, this is not just the United States.  We have more than 50 countries working actively in support of Ukraine.  And as I said before, this is maybe the best example of burden sharing that I’ve ever seen in 32 years that I’ve been doing this.  The United States has dedicated about a hundred billion dollars to Ukraine, allies and partners around the world $150 billion, and we continue to see that every day.

But it’s also a moment for everyone to do more, and we’re counting on European partners and others to strongly support Ukraine’s mobilization with training and equipment for these forces.  We need to see more artillery, more air defenses, more munitions getting to the Ukrainians, and we had a good conversation about all the work that allies and partners will be doing to step up to this moment as well.

It’s also more broadly an important moment for the Alliance, and we discussed this with the secretary general and with our colleagues around the North Atlantic Council.  We’ll be looking in the weeks ahead at the strategy that NATO has for dealing with Russia and particularly making sure that we have the strongest possible defense and deterrence.  We’ll be looking at what we’re doing to deal with some of the challenges posed by China, including the support that China is giving to Russia in the war of aggression through its support for Russia’s defense industrial base.  We’ll be looking at the challenge of hybrid threats, including those coming from Russia.

All of this is front and center in our agenda, but today the focus was intensely on what we’re doing and what we’re doing together to make sure that Ukraine is in the strongest possible position heading into 2025.

Finally, this.  As we were looking at the state of our Alliance – not just in the struggle with Russia for Ukraine but more broadly – I think we can say that we have an Alliance that is stronger, bigger, more effective than it’s ever been as a result of the work of the last four years.  And the ongoing importance of making sure that we have a strong NATO – one that we’re engaged in, invested in, and helping to lead – I think could not be more vital than it is now.

Here’s what we know, here’s what we know from history over these last 75 years, and here’s what we know looking forward.  The best way to defend ourselves, to prevent wars, to have security, is through the investments we’re making in NATO and in our other alliances and partnerships.  NATO in particular is founded on this principle:  An attack on one is an attack on all.  And that means that any would-be aggressor, anyone looking to take the fight to a NATO country, knows that if they do that, they have to take on all NATO countries.  That is the strongest possible deterrent to war.  It’s the best way to prevent war in the first place.  It’s the best way to ensure our security.  And that’s why it’s so vital that we continue to invest in this extraordinary Alliance and continue to lead in this extraordinary Alliance.

Happy to take some questions.

MODERATOR:  Nike Ching.

QUESTION:  Good morning, Mr. Secretary.

SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Good morning.

QUESTION:  Several questions for you if you may indulge me.  On Ukraine, is there any development on lifting restrictions on long-range fire?  What can the U.S. realistically do to improve the situation in Ukraine in the remaining time you have that cannot be easily undone?  Are there any new ideas you hope to implement, and can you also outline specific actions the U.S. and NATO Allies do in response to North Korea’s direct support for Russia’s war in Ukraine?

On Gaza, many humanitarian organizations are saying the situation in Gaza has actually gotten worse since you sent your letter 30 days ago and that Israel has failed to address several of the listed concerns.  Moving forward, what motivation will Israel have to improve the conditions on the ground when you fail to follow through on your previous warnings?  Thank you.

SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Thanks very much.  So on Ukraine, as I said, the President is determined that we push every dollar out the door that we have at our disposal, notably from the $61 billion supplemental that was passed on a bipartisan basis by Congress some months ago, and we’re on track to do exactly that.  So the drawdowns that we can do from our military equipment, they will go forward.  Obligating funds, that will go forward.  And that should ensure that Ukraine continues to receive from us what it needs.

But equally important is the work of our allies and partners.  And as I said, we have 50 countries that have been acting in support of Ukraine.  And I am convinced from the conversations we had today and the conversations we have virtually every day that that support will continue.  And not only continue; I expect it to increase and that our partners will continue to more than pick up their share of the burden.  So that’s critical.

In terms of exactly what we’re doing, I’ve said this before, I’ll say it again:  Every month that we’ve been engaged in the defense of Ukraine since the Russian aggression we have adapted and adjusted to the needs of Ukraine as the battlefield changes, as what Russia is doing changes, as new elements are introduced – for example, the North Korean forces.  And I can tell you that we will continue to adapt and adjust, again, to make sure that Ukraine is in the strongest possible position to deal with this aggression, to deter further aggression, to effectively defend itself.

On the Middle East and on Gaza, let me be very clear about both the intent and the effect of the letter that Secretary Austin and I sent a month ago to our Israeli counterparts.  The intent was to inject a sense of urgency with Israel to take necessary steps to address the dire humanitarian situation of children, women, and men in Gaza.  The effect has been that of the 15 steps that we urged action on, Israel has taken action either in implementing or being in the process of implementing 12 of the 15 steps.

There are three big issues that still need to be addressed that come from the letter – first, making sure that when Israel engages in an operation and people have been evacuated from an area, that once that operation is done it rescind the evacuation order so that people can return and we can start to take down some of this horrific overcrowding that we’re seeing in parts of Gaza where people have been sent to.  So that’s one.

Second, we want to see along with the humanitarian assistance getting in commercial trucks getting in with commercial goods.  This is vital because so many of the things that commercial truckers bring in, including things like fruits and vegetables, are absolutely essential to the balanced nutrition for people in Gaza.  That, in turn, is critical to making sure they have the immunities they need to fight off disease, and that’s not something normally the humanitarians do.  This comes in through commercial means.  The challenge there in terms of restoring commercial trucking has been a huge problem of lawlessness and looting inside of Gaza that needs to be addressed and that we’re working on finding a solution to.  But right now there are 900 trucks that are inside of Gaza at Karem Shalom that’s backed up.  They can’t be distributed because of this looting and because of the criminality.  So it’s imperative that that be addressed.  Israel has responsibilities to do that.  We’re also working with Egypt.

And then in my judgment maybe most significant, we need to see real and extended pauses in large areas of Gaza, pauses in any fighting, any combat, so that the assistance can effectively get to people who need it.  There are huge challenges in that regard, but we’ve also seen real solutions.  The polio vaccination campaign was the one thing that’s been very successful in Gaza.  Hundreds of thousands of children got polio vaccines.  But critical to success in doing that was having extended pauses for days, not simply hours as is the case right now, to make sure that everyone bringing assistance in has the ability to bring it in and to distribute it and to have space to do that.

So we will be working on this intensely in the days ahead.  I’ll be discussing this further with President Biden.  And the responsibility that Israel has in terms of making sure that assistance to the best of its ability can get to people who need it is an ongoing responsibility.  And I believe that the steps that it’s taken over the last weeks to address what we had in our letter, those steps would not have been taken absent the letter.  But it’s also critical, as the letter made clear, that not only are these steps taken but they need to be fully implemented and they need to be sustained if they’re going to have effect.  Yes, the last month has been terrible for people.  The letter went out – already we were into October.  We’re starting to see, as I said, implementation of most of the steps that we’ve laid out.  It will take some time for them to have effect.  And again, they have to be fully implemented and they have to be sustained.  But even with that, I think it’s essential that we see things like more extended pauses.

Now, the hard, bottom-line truth is also this.  Even with all of these steps, the situation is so difficult and so dramatic that to fully redress it, to fully answer the needs of people, the best way to do that is to end the war.  And from my perspective, what we’ve seen is this:  Israel, by the standards it set itself, has accomplished the goals that it set for itself, the strategic goals it set for itself.  It was rightly determined to make sure to the best of its ability that October 7th could never happen again.  To do that, it said that it needed to dismantle the military organization of Hamas and to get the leadership that was responsible for October 7th.  It’s done both of those things.

So this should be a time to end the war.  To do that, I think we need two things fundamentally.  One is we have to make sure that the hostages come home, including the seven Americans.  We’ve been working, as you know, on trying to get an agreement on a hostage and ceasefire deal.  Hamas tragically has demonstrated that it’s not going to engage on that despite the renewed efforts we’ve made in recent weeks.  It’s one of the reasons why Qatar has told them to leave Qatar.

But we also need to make sure that we have a plan for what follows, and this is something I’ve been working on intensely in recent weeks so that if Israel decides to end the war and we find a way to get the hostages out, we also have a clear plan so that Israel can get out of Gaza and we make sure that Hamas is not going back in.

So those plans we’re moving ahead as intensely as we can to flesh them out, to put them in place.  But short of ending the war, which we believe now is the time to move to that, we have to see these humanitarian steps fully implemented, sustained, and as I said, particularly with regard to pauses having more extensive pauses.

One final thing on this.  Israel has to meet these responsibilities, and we will be tracking this every single day.  I would note though as well that it’s extraordinary to me that as from almost day one there is no focus on Hamas and almost deafening silence around the world on Hamas.  Not only has it rejected engaging on the hostage/ceasefire proposals, not only has it rejected even smaller proposals that would have cost it nothing to release a small number of hostages and actually have Palestinian prisoners released from Israeli jails in return, not only that, but a couple of weeks ago Israel said we will guarantee safe passage for every Hamas militant out of Gaza, just give us the hostages back.  And they refused.  Is anyone talking about that?  The world has been silent on that, too.

So it would be good to also see some genuine, sustained, effective pressure on Hamas to do its part to end something that it started and that the Palestinian people who are caught in this crossfire of Hamas’ initiation didn’t start and themselves are powerless to stop.

MODERATOR:  Zoriana Stepanenko.

QUESTION:  Thank you so much for giving me the floor. Secretary Blinken, you just mentioned that since Russian full-scale invasion (inaudible) in 2022 you and United States partners are adjusting to Ukraine’s current needs.  However, Ukraine has outlined its own needs in so-called victory plan (inaudible) United States leadership, and one of the needs is to lift the restrictions of using the long-range weapon inside Russian territory.  Is there any chance that you will review your current decision and finally release those restrictions, and what are the prospects?

SECRETARY BLINKEN:  So first, we’re addressing many of the needs that are laid out in the victory plan.  That’s something that we discussed with allies and partners today.  And as I said a moment ago, the hallmark of our support for Ukraine starting in February of ’22 and carrying forward to today is making sure that we’re adapting and adjusting to Ukraine’s needs as the battlefield changes, as what Russia is doing changes, where the front lines are, how the war is being conducted, how the aggression is being conducted.  And I am convinced that we will continue to adapt and adjust as necessary.

Thanks.  Thanks, everyone.

Donald Trump,NA,Read Trump’s ‘100 Days’ Interview Transcript | TIME,"President Donald Trump at the White House on April 22, 2025, in front of a painting depicting the aftermath of the assassination attempt last July in Butler, Pa.

President Donald Trump sat down for an interview with TIME at the White House on April 22.

Over the course of the interview, Trump discussed a wide range of issues, including his trade war and the economy, immigration, presidential power, and the situations in Ukraine and the Middle East.

Below is a lightly edited transcript of the interview conducted by TIME Senior Political Correspondent Eric Cortellessa and Editor-in-Chief Sam Jacobs. Click here to read our fact check.

TIME: Obviously, a lot has happened. We want to have a conversation about what your first 100 days have looked like in office. And we want to try to touch on as many different points as we can.

Trump: There’s a lot, right? A lot of things happening.

You know better than anyone that the President of the United States is the most powerful person in the world. At the same time, it seems like you are expanding the power of the presidency. Why do you think you need more power?

Well, I don't feel I'm expanding it. I think I'm using it as it was meant to be used. I feel that we've had a very successful presidency in 100 days. We've had people writing it was the best first month and best second month, and really the best third month. But that you won't know about for a little while, because it takes a little time in transition. You know, we're resetting a table. We were losing $2 trillion a year on trade, and you can't do that. I mean, at some point somebody has to come along and stop it, because it's not sustainable. We were carrying other countries on our back with, you know, with trade numbers, with horrible numbers, and we've changed it. You see the market fluctuates quite a bit. Today, it's up 1,000 or 1,200 points. It goes up and down, but that will steady out, and we're taking in tremendous amounts of money. We have, as you know, already, 25% on cars, 25% on steel and aluminum—

Mr. President, I think what we’re driving at is that you've taken congressional authority on trade and appropriations. You fired the heads of independent agencies. You're challenging the courts right now, as you know. You're using the levers of government to weaken private institutions like law firms and universities. Isn't this seizing power away from institutions and concentrating them inside the presidency?

No, I think that what I'm doing is exactly what I've campaigned on. If you look at what I campaigned on, for instance, you can talk about removing people from the country. We have to do it because Biden allowed people to come in through his open border crazy, insanity. He allowed people to come into our country that we can't have in our country. Many criminals—they emptied their prisons, many countries, almost every country, but not a complete emptying, but some countries a complete emptying of their prison system. But you look all over the world, and I'm not just talking about South America, we're talking about all over the world. People have been led into our country that are very dangerous. If you were walking down the street, and if you happen to be near one of these people, they could, they would kill you, and they wouldn't even think about it. And we can't have that in our country.

So you're not concentrating more power in the presidency?

I don't think so. I think I'm using it properly, and I'm also using it as per my election. You know, everything that I'm doing—this is what I talked about doing. I said that I'm going to move the criminals out. I saw what was happening early on when I heard that he had open borders, when I, because it was a hard thing to believe. I built hundreds of miles of wall, and then he didn't want to, and we had another, an extra hundred miles that I could have put up because I ordered it as extra. I completed the wall, what I was doing, but we have, I wanted to build additional because it was working so well. An extension. And he didn't want to do that. And when he said he wasn't going to do that, I said, “Well, he must want open borders.” There were sections that were being built. And he stopped to work on it, and I said, this guy actually wants to have open borders. That's going to be a tragedy for our country. That's going to mean that other countries will release into our country some very rough people.

We’d love to come back to immigration but maybe start with the economy. Obviously an issue you campaigned on as well. You promised that you would immediately bring down prices and usher in a golden age of America. The prices of gas and eggs have gone down, but the cost of other things remain—

The prices of groceries have gone down. The only price that hasn't gone down is the price of energy. The cost of energy, I'm sorry, well, energy has gone down, excuse me. Let me change that—is the interest rates. And interest rates have essentially stayed the same. But almost every other thing, I mean, you take a look at what's going on, and this is, we're taking in billions of dollars of tariffs, by the way. And just to go back to the past, I took in hundreds of billions of dollars of tariffs from China, and then when COVID came, I couldn't institute the full program, but I took in hundreds of billions, and we had no inflation.

But let’s focus on what is happening right now because—

We took in billions of dollars, we had no inflation. Now, if you take a look, the price of groceries are down. The price of energy is down.

Inflation remains pretty much the same. And the IMF is saying it’s going to go up.

No, Eric, you can't say what they think, because so far what I thought is right. I've been right about—

401ks are down. The Atlanta Fed says our economy is contracting -2.2% during quarter one.

Well, they may have said that, but so far, they've been, I mean, I've been right. If you look at all of the years that I've been doing this, I've been right on things. You're gonna—you're gonna have the wealthiest country we've ever had, and you're gonna have an explosion upward in the not-too-distant future. You know, I've been here now for three months, and I inherited eggs, I inherited groceries, I inherited energy. It was all going through the roof. And we had the highest inflation we've ever had as a country, or very close to it. And I believe it was the highest ever. Somebody said it's the highest in only 48 years. That's a lot, too, but I believe we had the highest inflation we've ever had. I've been here now for three months. And three months, we are taking in billions and billions of dollars from other countries that we never took in before. And that's just the start.

Well let’s talk about the tariffs. You want companies to build and make goods here in America.

Not in all cases. There are some products I really don't want to make here.

Like t-shirts?

I can’t–I can give you a list because I actually have a list, but if you want, I could give it to you.

Well, I mean, the question is, how can CEOs make long-term plans and investments if our tariff policy can change from day to day and still remains so uncertain?

How can they make long-term investments? I'll turn it around. How can they make long-term investments if our country is losing $2 trillion a year on trade?

Will you consider giving exemptions—

No wait, just so you understand. How can we sustain and how is it sustainable that our country lost almost $2 trillion on trade in Biden years, in this last year. That's not—when you talk about a company. I had the head of Walmart yesterday, right in that seat. I had the head of Walmart. I had the head of Home Depot and the head of Target in my office. And I'll tell you what they think, they think what I'm doing is exactly right.

Well, the CEOs of small businesses are saying they may not be able to last another two months with the current regime in place. Will you consider giving small businesses an exemption similar to what you've given to Big Tech?

I’d have to look at the individual business.

Would you consider it?

Our country is going to be very rich in not a long period of time. I've been doing this for three months, and if you look at the kind of numbers that we're taking in and the jobs, and if you look at, more importantly, the companies, the chip companies, the car companies, the Apple. $500 billion. Apple is investing $500 billion in building plants. They never invested in this country.

Small businesses are worried that you’re treating the Apples of the world better than you’re treating them.

No, I’m treating small businesses—small businesses will be a bigger beneficiary of what I'm doing than than the large businesses. But everybody's going to benefit.

If we still have high tariffs, whether it's 20% or 30% or 50%, on foreign imports a year from now, will you consider that a victory?

Total victory.

Why so?

Because the country will be making a fortune. Look, that's what China did to us. They charge us 100%. If you look at India—India charges 100-150%. If you look at Brazil, if you look at many, many countries, they charge—that's how they survive. That's how they got rich. Now, zero would be easy. Oh, zero would be easy, but zero, you wouldn't have any companies coming in. They're coming in because they don't want to pay the tariffs. Remember this, there are no tariffs, if they make their product here. There are no tariffs, if they make their product here. There are no tariffs. This is a tremendous success. You just don't know it yet, but this is a tremendous success what’s happening. We're taking in billions and billions of dollars, money that we never took in before. We're also, very importantly, because of that, because of the money we're taking in, those companies are going to come back and they're going to make their product here. They're going to go back into North Carolina and start making furniture again. They've already started. In Mexico, many car plants that were under construction have stopped. They're all coming into this country. We're gonna, you're gonna see car plants going at a level that you've never seen before.

Your trade adviser–

I'm also—chips. Look at Jensen.

Nvidia.

He's gonna spend $500 billion. Look at Mr. Wei from Taiwan.

Do you trust them when they say that? These businessmen who say, Oh, I'm gonna spend $500 billion.

Oh yeah. Well, I’ll tell you why I trust them. First of all, I think they’re trustworthy people. But more importantly, they have no choice, because they won't be able to pay the tariffs if they don't do it. The tariffs are bringing in the business. Remember, with all the, you know, questions you're asking about tariffs, there are no tariffs when you make your product here.

Sure, no, I understand, Mr. President—

Zero.

Your trade adviser, Peter Navarro, says 90 deals in 90 days is possible. We're now 13 days into the point from when you lifted the reciprocal, the discounted reciprocal tariffs. There's zero deals so far. Why is that?

No, there’s many deals.

When are they going to be announced?

Advertisement

You have to understand, I'm dealing with all the companies, very friendly countries. We're meeting with China. We're doing fine with everybody. But ultimately, I've made all the deals.

Not one has been announced yet. When are you going to announce them?

I’ve made 200 deals.

You’ve made 200 deals?

100%.

Can you share with whom?

Because the deal is a deal that I choose. View it differently: We are a department store, and we set the price. I meet with the companies, and then I set a fair price, what I consider to be a fair price, and they can pay it, or they don't have to pay it. They don't have to do business with the United States, but I set a tariff on countries. Some have been horrible to us. Some have been okay. Nobody's been great. Nobody's been great. Everybody took advantage of us. What I'm doing is I will, at a certain point in the not too distant future, I will set a fair price of tariffs for different countries. These are countries—some of them have made hundreds of billions of dollars, and some of them have made just a lot of money. Very few of them have made nothing because the United States was being ripped off by every, almost every country in the world, in the entire world. So I will set a price, and when I set the price, and I will set it fairly according to the statistics, and according to everything else. For instance, do they have the VAT system in play? Do they charge us tariffs? How much are they charging us? How much have they been charging us? Many, many different factors, right. How are we being treated by that country? And then I will set a tariff. Are we paying for their military? You know, as an example, we have Korea. We pay billions of dollars for the military. Japan, billions for those and others. But that, I'm going to keep us a separate item, the paying of the military. Germany, we have 50,000 soldiers—

I’m just curious, why don’t you announce these deals that you’ve solidified?

I would say, over the next three to four weeks, and we're finished, by the way.

You’re finished?

We’ll be finished.

Oh, you will be finished in three to four weeks.

I’ll be finished. Now, some countries may come back and ask for an adjustment, and I'll consider that, but I'll basically be, with great knowledge, setting—ready? We're a department store, a giant department store, the biggest department store in history. Everybody wants to come in and take from us. They're going to come in and they're going to pay a price for taking our treasure, for taking our jobs, for doing all of these things. But what I'm doing with the tariffs is people are coming in, and they're building at levels you've never seen before. We have $7 trillion of new plants, factories and other things, investment coming into the United States. And if you look back at past presidents, nobody was anywhere near that. And this is in three months.

Will you call President Xi if he doesn’t call you?

No.

You won’t?

Nope.

Has he called you yet?

Yep.

When did he call you?

He's called. And I don't think that's a sign of weakness on his behalf.

But you would think it’s a sign of weakness if you called him?

I don’t–I just look—

Well, what did he say?

If people want to–well, we all want to make deals. But I am this giant store. It's a giant, beautiful store, and everybody wants to go shopping there. And on behalf of the American people, I own the store, and I set prices, and I'll say, if you want to shop here, this is what you have to pay.

This period of uncertainty will be over in three to four weeks?

I don’t think there’s any uncertainty there. The only thing—they have an option. They don't have to shop here. They can go someplace else, but there aren't too many places they can go. You understand what I mean though?

Advertisement

Sure. Your Treasury Secretary says this situation with China is unsustainable.

Oh I agree. You mean the way it is now?

Yes.

Or the way it was before I got here?

The current moment, too, he believes is unsustainable.

Well, no, they won’t do any business here, because at 145% it's going to be very rare that you see business.

But your conversations with Xi have made you feel like we’re moving towards a more productive—

Oh, there’s a number at which they will feel comfortable. Yeah. But you can’t let them make a trillion dollars from us. You can’t let them make $750 billion. See, that’s really what’s not sustainable when China makes a trillion dollars, or a trillion one, when we have almost $2 trillion worth of, I call it loss. Some people don't, but a lot of it’s loss. I say, when you have a trade deficit of $2 trillion I consider that loss.

Mr. President, there was a period of time on April 9 when the bond market was under extreme stress and there was a risk of a financial crisis far beyond what the plummeting stock market suggested.

Advertisement

I wasn’t worried.

What did your advisers tell you, though? You were in the Oval Office with Scott Bessent and Howard Lutnick. What did they tell you to convince you to lift the reciprocal tariffs for the 90-day pause?

They didn’t tell me. I did that.

What made you decide?

It wasn’t for that reason.

It wasn’t for the bond market?

No, it wasn’t for that reason. I'm doing that until we come up with the numbers that I want to come up with. I've met with a lot of countries. I've talked on the telephone. I don’t even want them to come in.

You said the bond market was getting the yips.

The bond market was getting the yips, but I wasn’t. Because I know what we have. I know what we have, but I also know we won't have it for long if we allowed four more years of the gross incompetence. This thing was just running—it was running as a free spirit. This was—this was the most incompetent president in history.

In our interview last year, Mr. President, you committed to complying with all Supreme Court orders.

I said what?

You committed to complying with all Supreme Court orders—

Yeah.

When you and I spoke last April. Are you still committed to complying with all Supreme Court orders?

Sure, I believe in the court system.

The Supreme Court ruled 9-0 that you have to bring back Kilmar Abrego Garcia. You haven't done so. Aren’t you disobeying the Supreme Court?

Well, that’s not what my people told me—they didn’t say it was, they said it was—the nine to nothing was something entirely different.

Let me quote from the ruling. “The order properly requires the government to facilitate Abrego Garcia's release from custody in El Salvador.” Are you facilitating a release?

I leave that to my lawyers. I give them no instructions. They feel that the order said something very much different from what you're saying. But I leave that to my lawyers. If they want—and that would be the Attorney General of the United States and the people that represent the country. I don't make that decision.

Have you asked President Bukele to return him?

I haven’t, uh, he said he wouldn’t.

Did you ask him?

But I haven’t asked him positively, but he said he wouldn’t.

But if you haven't asked him, then how are you facilitating his release?

Well, because I haven't been asked to ask him by my attorneys. Nobody asked me to ask him that question, except you.

Do you believe he deserves his day in court?

I believe that they made him look like a saint, and then we found out about him. He wasn't a saint. He was MS-13. He was a wife beater and he had a lot of things that were very bad, you know, very, very bad. When I first heard of the situation, I was not happy, and then I found out that he was a person who was an MS-13 member. And in fact, he had a tattooed right on his—I'm sure you saw that—he had it tattooed right on his knuckles: MS-13. No, I believe he's a man who has got quite a past. This is no longer just a nice, wonderful man from Maryland, which people, which the fake news had me and other people for a period of time believing. Now, nobody believes that. And I think  this isa very bad—I think this is another menwomen’s sports thing for the Democrats.

Advertisement

Maybe, but Mr. President, whatever he might have done, whoever he might be affiliated with, doesn’t he deserve his day in court? Nazi saboteurs who came on our shores at Montauk during World War II had their day in court. Al Qaeda terrorists had their day in court.

I really give that to my lawyers to determine, that’s why I have them. That’s not my determination. It's something that, frankly, bringing him back and retrying him wouldn't bother me, but I leave that up to my lawyer. You could bring him back and retry him—

That’s exactly right. You could fix this simply by bringing him back and going through the legal process—

But I leave that decision to the lawyers. At this moment, they just don’t want to do that. They say we’re in total compliance with the Supreme Court.

What about the lower courts? Are you committed to complying with lower courts?

Sure. All courts.

One more question on this, sir. You took an oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution. The Constitution says the Supreme Court is the ultimate authority once they issue a ruling. If you defy them, aren't you violating your oath?

Advertisement

I'm not defying the Supreme Court. I never defy the Supreme Court. I wouldn't do that. I'm a big believer in the Supreme Court, and have a lot of respect for the Justices.

You asked President Bukele of El Salvador to build out the CECOT prison to house American citizens. You said you would love to send “homegrown criminals” there—

No, I didn’t say that. I said if it were permissible according to the law, I would like to do that, yes.

Well, do you intend to send American citizens to foreign persons?

I would love to do that if it were permissible by law. We're looking into that. When I have a person, these would be extreme cases. When I have a person that is a 28-time in and out person that goes out and tries to kill people every time he or she is out, I would have no problem with doing that whatsoever. We're talking about career criminals that are horrible people that we house and we have to take care of for 50 years while they suffer because they killed people. If you ask me whether or not I would do that, I would, but totally, and I think you have to leave this part of the sentence totally subject to it being allowed under law. And people are looking to see if it would be allowed under law. We have crime rates under Biden that went through the roof, and we have to bring those rates down. And unfortunately, those rates have been added to by the illegal immigrants that he allowed into the country.

Which Americans would you do that to?

I would do that to people that hit old ladies over the head with a baseball bat, for people that grab their bicycle? You saw that one where they dragged an old woman along the street on a motorcycle, a bicycle, a motorcycle, I think. People that push people into subway trains just before the train is ready to stop. You saw that? The man barely lived. Think of it. And a guy comes up to him, and from behind he pushes him. That's a serious, serious thing. People that shoot people in the back, people that are executioners. Yeah, I would have no trouble with that but subject to it being allowed by law.

Do you really want there to be gulags for American citizens in foreign countries?

Gulag? You define gulag.

Prisons like in the Soviet Union—

Look, I see where you’re coming from, from the moment this interview started, and it's fine, I don't mind. I've answered every question that can be answered by mankind or womankind, and I see where you're coming from. Rapid fire. You can't even wait for me to give you the answer. You should let me give you that final answer.

Advertisement

Go ahead, sir.

No, no, I’m not—I’m just saying, I see where you’re coming from, and you’re just so wrong. You’re so wrong. These are people that have been in jail for 20 times. They're career criminals. Do I have a problem with a career criminal that hits people with baseball bats when they're not looking, that pushes people into subways, that shoots people in the face or in the back? I have absolutely no problem with doing that, if the law allows it to be done and we're looking at it. And one of the reasons I like it is because it would be much less expensive than our prison system, and I think it would actually be a greater deterrent.

Sir, on that note, how much are we paying President Bukele for holding those prisoners?

I don’t know. I could get you the information, but we’re paying less than we would normally.

Did you personally approve those payments?

No, I didn’t.

Many of the Jan. 6 prisoners you pardoned pleaded guilty to or were convicted of violent crimes as part of the capital attack. Days before you pardoned them, J.D. Vance said “of course” you wouldn't include those who committed violence. What changed?

What changed where?

At what moment did you decide to include all of the defendants, including the ones who committed violent offenses?

Because I've watched in Portland and I watched in Seattle, and I've watched in Minneapolis, Minnesota and other places. People do heinous acts, far more serious than what took place on Jan. 6. And nothing happened to these people. Nothing. And I said, What a double standard it is. And we were talking about a very small group of people that are in your definition, most of these people should have been let out a long time ago. There's never been a group of people, maybe with one exception, I won't even go into it, one exception as a group. But there's never been a group of people that's been treated so horribly as the J6 people. You know, when I say peacefully and patriotically, nobody mentions that. When I say go peacefully and patriotically, nobody ever mentions that. Nobody mentions the fact that the unselect committee of political scum, the unselect committee, horrible people, they destroyed all evidence, they burned it, they got rid of it, they destroyed it, and they deleted all evidence. And we went in looking for evidence, and they said, I'm sorry, we don't have it anymore. It's been destroyed. If I ever did that, it would be unthinkable what you guys, what you two guys, would be doing and writing, but, you know, and nobody wants to talk about it, and you won't write about it, and nobody writes about it. It’s unbelievable, right? But people get it. I mean, people get it. They get what I'm saying, and they obviously believe it, because I had a hell of an election.

You campaigned on it, and you won decisively.

No and everything I campaigned. If you think of, you know, the way you ask me these questions, like, it's so serious that we're moving people out of the country. I said during the election that I'm going to move them out of the country, and that's what we're doing.

Can you talk a little bit about the budget?

Yeah. And if we didn't do it, then you two would not be safe. I guarantee it.

Some Republicans are considering raising taxes on millionaires in the package you're planning to pass that would extend your 2017 tax cuts. Do you support that idea?

Well, I’ll tell ya, I certainly don’t mind having a tax increase, and the only reason I wouldn't support it is because I saw Bush where they said, where he said “Read my lips” and he lost an election. He would have lost it anyway, but he lost an election. He got beat up pretty good. I would be honored to pay more, but I don't want to be in a position where we lose an election because I was generous, but me, as a rich person, would not mind paying and you know, we're talking about very little. We're talking about one point. It doesn't make that much difference, and yet, I could just see somebody trying to bring that up as a subject, and, you know, say, “Oh, he raised taxes.” Well, I wouldn't be, really, you know, in the true sense, I wouldn't. I'd be raising them on wealthy to take care of middle class. And that's—I love, that. I actually love the concept, but I don't want it to be used against me politically, because I've seen people lose elections for less, especially with the fake news.

Advertisement

Do you think it would help cover the cost that would be lost from getting rid of taxes on tips and some of these other proposals?

Well, that would be able to take it. See, that would be able to do it, but I would not mind personally paying more. But the concept is something that may not be acceptable to the public.

Experts estimate that the House Republican budget will result in more than $800 billion in losses to Medicaid over the next 10 years. Do you support that?

Due to what?

The House Republican budget that would cut roughly $800 billion from Medicaid.

I don’t think they’re going to cut $800 billion. They’re going to look at waste, fraud, and abuse.

So would you veto a bill if it had cuts to Medicaid?

If it was an increase, if we were deducting something from—I would, but it's waste, it's fraud and abuse is what we're looking for. And nobody minds that.

If Republicans send you a bill that cuts Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, you commit to vetoing it?

Advertisement

If it cuts it, I would not approve.

So you would veto that?

I would veto it, yeah. But they’re not going to do that.

Would you support a ban on congressional stock trading?

Well, I watched Nancy Pelosi get rich through insider information, and I would be okay with it. If they send that to me, I would do it.

You'll sign it?

Absolutely.

The FTC is currently trying Meta for maintaining an illegal monopoly by acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp. Do you think more companies need to be broken up?

It depends on the company, depends on the market, depends on what the company does. But I think that a lot of companies certainly have been looked at during the Obama and during the Biden regime certainly.

Do you think corporate monopolies have hurt average Americans?

In some cases, yeah. In some cases, not.

I’d like to ask you some questions about DOGE. You've put Elon Musk in charge of this cost-cutting operation. The question is, why is the government, through DOGE, amassing the sensitive personal information about everyday Americans, which was previously stored across different agencies, all in one place?

Advertisement

DOGE has been a very big success. We found hundreds of billions of dollars of waste, fraud, and abuse. Billions of dollars being given to politicians, single politicians based on the environment. It's a scam. It's illegal, in my opinion, so much of the stuff that we found, but I think DOGE has been a big success from that standpoint.

[An aide interrupts the interview for President Trump to take a phone call from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi]

So if we can just come back to the question before the call, which is the database that DOGE is putting together Americans’ information. Why are they doing that?

Because we want to find waste, fraud, and abuse, and want to cut our costs.

Some officials have described what DOGE is doing is creating a central kind of “God-mode” view into government databases that has been, up until now, intentionally kept separate. The idea, they say, is to basically use this information to advance your policy goals. Is this an accurate characterization?

Advertisement

No, that’s inaccurate, as you know. I mean, it’s a crazy question. We just want to find fraud, abuse. We want to find who's on the rolls that shouldn't be, who's getting paid every month by the government that shouldn't be paid. Do these people exist? In many cases, they don't, in some cases, even worse, they do. They've been getting money, and they shouldn't be.

What does your administration plan to do with information obtained by the IRS and other agencies as part of the DOGE effort?

Well, I don’t know about the IRS, because, as you know, I’m not involved in it, but we’ve found tremendous waste, fraud and abuse. Tremendous.

Will any of it be used to track down and round up migrants as part of the deportation operation?

Not that I know of, no.

Let's talk about the cuts. As you know, Mr. President, a lot of American companies do business with the government. The DOGE cuts aren't just affecting government employees. They're also affecting American businesses that provide goods and services to the federal government. There were nearly 280,000 layoffs in March across virtually every sector. Why is it better for these people to be out of jobs?

Advertisement

Because we have to have an efficient country. And when the country gets down to bare knuckles, you're going to see, you're going to see something the likes of which this world has never seen before. We're going to make our country strong, powerful, and very rich again. Right now, our country is not sustainable. We're being ripped off by everybody in the world, other countries, other people, other militaries, are ripping us off. We're protecting countries for no money or for very minimal money, and that wasn't supposed to happen. We're not supposed to be protecting everybody. We're supposed to be, number one, taking care of ourself, and number two, helping people when we can, helping outside people and outside countries where we can. But we've been ripped off by levels that you've never seen. European Union sounds nice, but they've been very tough. $300 billion loss. China—hundreds of billions of dollars in losses. And I can go through a list, but I don't want to, because there are many friendly countries, our friendly countries, in many cases, are worse than our enemies. And it's not a sustainable model. It's not a sustainable possibility even, that a country can go through that and Biden let it get to a level that is seriously dangerous.

Advertisement

Well, many Americans certainly agree with you that they want to get rid of government fraud, waste, and abuse. They want to shrink the federal—

It’s not only government. It’s deals. It's horrible deals that have been made with other countries. As an example, China has been ripping us off for many years, until I came along.  I raised, I upped tariffs on China, hundreds of billions of dollars. We've done hundreds of billions, hundreds.

But domestically, for instance, your administration blocked grants for the National Institutes of Health that funded research into infectious diseases, cancers, Alzheimer's—

Well maybe we didn't think they were right. You know, I mean, you look at the people, look at the money that was given away by others. We didn't get anything out of it.

Well what do you tell the families and people who are suffering from those diseases?

We're taking care of—we're spending a lot. I spent 58—we spent, let's see, I think $58 billion in the first term. We were spending tremendous amounts of money, and I am now, but they have to be a little bit careful. A lot of the money like Stacey Abrams got $2 billion on the environment. They had $100 in the account and she got $2 billion just before these people left—and had to do with something that she knows nothing about.

NIH is the world’s largest funder of cancer research—

Shouldn’t they be asking those questions? I could give you a list of abuse and waste and fraud, and you don't have any interest in hearing it. I mean, I just see by these questions, just wondering, with all of the bad things that have happened, with all of the things we found, you have no interest in those things. You only have an interest. So what about this? What about that? Our country is going to be strong again because of what we're doing, and this is not a sustainable model, what we're looking at. And I think very importantly, I had a great election. Won all seven swing states, won millions and millions of votes. Won millions of votes. They say it was the most consequential election in 129 years. I don't know if that's right, but it was certainly a big win, and that's despite cheating that took place, by the way, because there was plenty of cheating that took place.

Advertisement

In ‘24?

‘24, yeah. ‘20, of course. But ‘24 also, they tried. They tried that. They did their best. It's the only thing they're good at. But we're gonna have a great country again. Just remember, every single question you're asking, I campaigned on it. I campaigned on all the things you're talking about, all the things you're asking about, and openly campaigned. And we're given credit, even by radical left lunatics. We are given credit for that. We're given credit for saying, This is what I'm going to do. If you look at your questions, that's what I campaigned on.

Following that call, I'd love to hear a little bit about the role that you're playing on the world stage. And I think that you campaigned on that too.

It’s interesting because you see the relationship. I didn't want to wait, you know, have you leave the room, but you see the relationship. I have that relationship with many leaders. If I can stop losing 3,000 human beings a week on average, with Russia, Ukraine, it's only because of me, nobody else could have stopped it. I think we're going to do that, by the way. I think that'll be done. I think that we're going to make a deal with Iran. I think we're going to make a deal with Iran. Nobody else could do that.

Advertisement

You said you would end the war in Ukraine on Day One.

Well, I said that figuratively, and I said that as an exaggeration, because to make a point, and you know, it gets, of course, by the fake news [unintelligible]. Obviously, people know that when I said that, it was said in jest, but it was also said that it will be ended.

Well what’s taking so long? When do you think it will be ended?

Well, I don’t think it’s long. I mean, look, I got here three months ago. This war has been going on for three years. It's a war that would have never happened if I was president. It's Biden's war. It’s not my war. I have nothing to do with it. I would have never had this war. This war would have never happened. Putin would have never done it. This war would have never happened. Oct. 6 would have never happened. Oct. 7 would have never happened. Would have never happened. Ever. You then say, what’s taking so long? Do you hear this, Steve? The war has been raging for three years. I just got here, and you say, what's taken so long?

Advertisement

Do you think peace is still possible if Putin is President?

I think peace is possible. You say if Putin is still president?

Yeah, if Putin is President. Can there be peace if Putin is President of Russia?

I think with me as president, there's—possible, if very probable. If somebody else is president, no chance.

If Putin can make peace?

Yeah, I think Putin will.  I think Putin would rather do it a different way. I think he’d rather go and take the whole thing. And I think that because of me, I believe I'm the only one that can get this thing negotiated. And I think we’re a long way. We've had very good talks, and we're getting very close to a deal. And I don't believe anybody else could have made that deal.

Do you believe peace is possible if Zelensky is still President of Ukraine?

Yeah, I do. He is president now and I think we’re going to make a deal.

Should Ukraine give up any hope of ever joining NATO?

Advertisement

I don’t think they’ll ever be able to join NATO. I think that's been—from day one, I think that's been, that's I think what caused the war to start was when they started talking about joining NATO. If that weren't brought up, there would have been a much better chance that it wouldn’t have started.

Should Crimea go to the Russians? Should they get to keep Crimea?

Well, Crimea went to the Russians. It was handed to them by Barack Hussein Obama, and not by me. With that being said, will they be able to get it back? They've had their Russians. They've had their submarines there for long before any period that we're talking about, for many years. The people speak largely Russian in Crimea. But this was given by Obama. This wasn't given by Trump. Would it have been taken from me like it was taken from Obama? No, it wouldn't have happened. Crimea, if I were president, it would not have been taken.

Advertisement

Would it be acceptable to you in a deal if Crimea and the four other regions that Russia has taken from Ukraine would be folded into Russia under a final accommodation?

If Crimea will stay with Russia—we have to only talk about Crimea because that's the one that always gets mentioned. Crimea will stay with Russia. And Zelensky understands that, and everybody understands that it's been with them for a long time. It's been with them long before Trump came along. Again, this is Obama's war. This is a war that should have never happened. I call it the war that should have never happened.

You’ve talked about improving relations with Moscow. Are you pursuing negotiations with them on issues other than Ukraine?

No—

Like nuclear weapons stockpiles or testing?

But if a deal has happened, I can see us doing business with Ukraine and with Russia as a country.

You've talked about acquiring Greenland, taking control of  the Panama Canal, making Canada the 51st state. Maybe you're trolling a little bit on that one. I don't know.

Advertisement

Actually, no, I’m not.

Well, do you want to grow the American empire?

Well, it depends as an empire, it wasn't, these are not things that we had before, so I'd view it a little bit differently if we had the right opportunity. Yeah, I think Greenland would be very well off if they I think it's important for us for national security and even international security. I think Canada, what you said that, “Well, that one, I might be trolling.” But I'm really not trolling. Canada is an interesting case. We lose $200 to $250 billion a year supporting Canada. And I asked a man who I called Governor Trudeau. I said, ”Why? Why do you think we're losing so much money supporting you? Do you think that's right? Do you think that's appropriate for another country to make it possible, for a country to sustain and he was unable to give me an answer, but it costs us over $200 billion a year to take care of Canada?” We’re taking care of their military. We're taking care of every aspect of their lives, and we don't need them to make cars for us. In fact, we don't want them to make cars for us. We want to make our own cars. We don't need their lumber. We don't need their energy. We don't need anything from Canada. And I say the only way this thing really works is for Canada to become a state.

Steven Cheung: We’re coming up on time, about 10 minutes.

Okay, we'll move quickly then. Last note: Do you want to be remembered as a president who expanded American territory?

Wouldn’t mind.

One more question on the cuts, sir. You've made cuts to homeland security, cyber defenses, the Nuclear Security Administration, your FBI chief is pushing to shift the bureau from domestic intelligence to criminal investigation. These are programs that were set up after September 11 to prevent terrorist attacks. Are you worried that this could be making America more vulnerable to an attack?

No. America will be much stronger.

If we are attacked, do you risk being blamed for letting down our defenses?

What does that mean?

If we are subject to an attack, do you risk being blamed because of these cuts?

I think I'll be blamed no matter what. I think if I make the country unbelievably successful, which it's not now, we owe $36 trillion right? It's, you know, when you think about it, a lot of money, a lot of money, but, but no, I think I'll be, I'll be blamed whether it's successful or not. I'm used to it.

Advertisement

You may be right about that. UNICEF says that more than 300 children have been killed and more than 600 have been wounded since the ceasefire in Gaza broke down. Who is to blame for those deaths?

I would say that the blame for that is Biden more than anybody else, because I had, as you know, Iran was broke, and he allowed them to become rich—

More than Hamas?

There was no money for Hamas. There was no money for Hezbollah. There was no money. Iran was broke under Trump, and you know that, he knows that, broke. They had no money, and they told Hamas, we're not giving you any money. When Biden came and he took off all the sanctions, he let China and everybody else buy all the oil, Iran developed $300 billion in cash  over a four year period. They started funding terror again, including Hamas. Hamas was out of business. Hezbollah was out of business. Iran had no money under me. I blame the Biden administration, because they allowed Iran to get back into the game without working a deal.

Advertisement

You’ve begun direct talks with Iran. Are you open to meeting with Iran’s President or Supreme Leader?

Sure.

You reportedly stopped Israel from attacking Iran's nuclear sites.

That's not right.

It’s not right?

No, it’s not right. I didn’t stop them. But I didn't make it comfortable for them, because I think we can make a deal without the attack. I hope we can. It's possible we'll have to attack because Iran will not have a nuclear weapon. But I didn't make it comfortable for them, but I didn't say no. Ultimately I was going to leave that choice to them, but I said I would much prefer a deal than bombs being dropped.

Are you worried Netanyahu will drag you into a war?

No.

Let’s talk about some of the issues with universities—

By the way, he may go into a war. But we’re not getting dragged in.

The U.S. will stay out of it if Israel goes into it?

No, I didn’t say that. You asked if he’d drag me in, like I’d go in unwillingly. No, I may go in very willingly if we can't get a deal. If we don't make a deal, I'll be leading the pack.

You're planning your first major foreign trip for your second term to the Middle East next month. What are the last hurdles for Saudi Israeli normalization?

Well, what I want, and the reason I'm doing it, is because Saudi Arabia, I happen to like the people very much, and the Crown Prince and the King—I like all of them, but they've agreed to invest a trillion dollars in our economy. $1 trillion. I'm then going to Qatar, and I'm then going to UAE, and then I'm coming back, and then we're making another. I think our foreign policy has been incredible, and it was before, and it is now. You sort of got a little glimpse of it.

Are you closer to a Saudi-Israeli normalization deal than you were before?

I have very good relationships in the Middle East, and I think all over the world. I think it's—well, the smarter people understand. I have stopped—I have solved more problems in the world without asking for or getting credit.

Advertisement

This would be a big one.

Which one?

Saudi-Israeli normalization. You had the Abraham Accords, one of your, you know, historic accomplishments—

Unfortunately, they did nothing. They did nothing with the Abraham Accords. We had four countries in there, it was all set. We would have had it packed. Now we're going to start it again. The Abraham Accords is a tremendous success, but Biden just sat with it.

Can you build on it to get the Saudi-Israeli normalization deal?

Well, I tell you what: I think Saudi Arabia will go into the Abraham Accords.

Yeah?

Yeah, and by the way, I think it will be full very quickly.

It would be a big deal if that happens.

They did nothing. Oh, that will happen.

That would be a big accomplishment. The State Department said it has revoked 300 student visas, primarily because of their participation in campus protests. I want to ask you about this, Mr. President, because you emphasized free speech as a cornerstone of your campaign, you castigated efforts to suppress it. But now it looks like your administration is deporting hundreds of people for engaging in speech you don't like. Why?

Advertisement

Tremendous anti-semitism at every one of those rallies. Tremendous, and I agree with free speech, but not riots all over every college in America. Tremendous anti-semitism going on in this country.

Are you worried that you're intimidating students or chilling free speech on American campuses and elsewhere throughout the country?

No, they can protest, but they can't destroy the schools like they did with Columbia and others.

Let’s talk about one case. Are you familiar with the case of the Tufts University student Reynessa Ozturk, who was arrested by a group of plain clothes officers. Well, she has since been accused by your government of having ties to Hamas. They have not revealed any evidence. Would you direct your Department of Justice to disclose the evidence that she is connected to Hamas?

I would have no trouble with it, no. I’ll look into it, but I’m not aware of the particular event.

Advertisement

You were harshly critical of what you called the weaponization of the Justice System under Biden. You recently signed memos—

Well, sure, but you wouldn’t be—if this were Biden, well, first of all, he wouldn't do an interview because he was grossly incompetent.

We spoke to him last year, Mr. President.

Huh?

We spoke to him a year ago.

How did he do?

You can read the interview yourself.

Not too good. I did read the interview. He didn't do well. He didn't do well at all. He didn't do well at anything. And he cut that interview off to being a matter of minutes, and you weren't asking him questions like you're asking me.

Well, we appreciate that you are able and willing to answer these questions. It says something about you, Mr. President.

I am indeed. I've been answering them for years and I’ve been getting elected by bigger and bigger numbers all the time, but you didn't ask questions like this to Biden, because if you did, he would have crawled under this beautiful desk.

Advertisement

You recently signed memos calling for an investigation of Chris Krebs, a top cybersecurity official in your first term. Isn't that, though, what you accused Biden of doing to you?

I think Chris Krebs was a disgrace to our country. I think he was—I think he was terrible. By the way, I don't know him. I'm not—I don't think I ever met him. I probably saw him around. You know, I have people come in, like the other one. He came in, and he's on CNN all the time as like an expert on Trump. I have no idea who he is. And Chris Krebs the same thing. I guess he probably said he knows me, but I have no idea. And you know, oftentimes I'll have some people sitting right here, and behind them will be 10 or 15 people from their agency or their office, and they'll stand there, and then all of a sudden, I'll hear that like I'm, you know, they're all time experts in me. I know very little about Chris Krebs, but I think he was very deficient.

Advertisement

You've used threats and lawsuits, other forms of coercion—

Well, I’ve gotta be doing something right, because I've had a lot of law firms give me a lot of money.

Why is that an appropriate use of presidential power?

Well, I think it is because I think they felt that the election was rigged and stolen and they didn't want to be a part of it. You think they gave me $100 million each for nothing? You know these law firms gave me $100 million worth of work, et cetera, and other things. And do you think they gave me that because I'm a nice guy? I don't think so. They gave it to me because they knew what they did wrong and they didn't want to get involved with it. And that's okay. That's the way it works, unfortunately.

But that is an appropriate use of presidential power, you think?

Which is?

The threats and the EOs against the law firms.

They pay–these are the top firms in the world. These are the biggest, the best: Cravath, Milbank Tweed, Paul Weiss. These are the toughest, smartest firms. They don't, they don't do this unless there's a little problem or a big problem.

Advertisement

Isn't cutting a deal with them to remove a threat from you and to do pro-bono work for causes you like just a form of extortion?

I don’t think it was a threat. I think they did that because, I assume they did it because they felt they did something wrong. Otherwise they would have, we would have had a lawsuit.

You once said you weren't sure how the Civil Rights Act quote “worked out.” Would America be better without it?

I never heard of that. Nobody’s ever asked me that before.

You said it in a 2020 interview.

I don't remember having said that.

Cheung: We have time for one more question.

When we spoke to you a year ago, we asked whether you would challenge the 22nd Amendment, which limits presidents to two terms. You said, and I quote, “I'm going to serve one term. I'm going to do a great job, and I'm going to leave.” What changed?

Well, I’m serving two terms now.

You meant one in addition to the one you already served.

Advertisement

You mean one more. I have more people begging me to run again, but I haven't looked at even the possibility. But the only thing that's changed is they think I'm doing a great job, and they like the way I'm running the country. They have a border, which you didn't ask about, that's virtually totally closed. The best border we've ever had.

Border crossings are down substantially.

No, I mean, it's, it's really, people can't believe it. They interviewed some farmers, really beautiful people that lived on the other side. They were being drawn into fights and horror shows, and now, I mean, it was dangerous. One of them got very badly injured, and by an illegal migrant that came across. And they asked him, How is it now? He said, ”Thank God for Donald Trump. It's the best it's ever been. And I've lived here for 50 years.”

You recently said you were “not joking” about seeking a third term and that there were methods to do it. What methods?

Advertisement

I'd rather not discuss that now, but as you know, there are some loopholes that have been discussed that are well known. But I don't believe in loopholes. I don't believe in using loopholes.

You wouldn’t run as vice president to J.D. Vance?

I don’t know anything about, what, look, all I can say is this, I am being inundated with requests. I'm doing a good job. Great physical exam, and unlike every other president, I took the cognitive test and I aced it 100% and I bet you guys couldn't get 100% on that exam. It's a tough exam. You know, when you get into the mid questions, it gets to be pretty tricky and pretty tough, and the last questions are very tough, and I aced it. And I guarantee, I'd give you, I'd make a big, beautiful bet that you guys couldn't ace it. But anyway. But look, it's good to have you, it’s a very nasty interview. They don’t ask any of the good things.

Advertisement

One final question. Mr. President, you were showing us the new paintings you have behind us. You put all these new portraits. One of them includes John Adams. John Adams said we’re a government ruled by laws, not by men. Do you agree with that?

John Adams said that? Where was the painting?

It’s right here.

We’re a government ruled by laws, not by men? Well, I think we're a government ruled by law, but you know, somebody has to administer the law. So therefore men, certainly, men and women, certainly play a role in it. I wouldn't agree with it 100%. We are a government where men are involved in the process of law, and ideally, you're going to have honest men like me.

Thank you, Mr. President. We appreciate your time.

Thank you.

Donald Trump,NA,FULL TRANSCRIPT: Trump's exclusive 100 days broadcast interview with ABC News - ABC News,"President Donald Trump sat down with ABC News' Terry Moran in the Oval Office.

President Donald Trump exclusively sat down with ABC News on Tuesday for the first broadcast interview marking the 100-day milestone of his second term.

ABC News anchor and Senior National Correspondent Terry Moran conducted the interview from the Oval Office, which aired on ABC at 8 p.m. ET. The interview will also be streamed later Tuesday on ABC News Live, Disney+ and Hulu.

The president's first 100 days back in the White House have been marked by controversial tariffs, an overhaul of U.S. immigration enforcement and massive cuts to the federal workforce, all policies that Trump notes he campaigned on.

Read the full transcript of ABC News' milestone interview with Trump below.

TERRY MORAN: Okay. Mr. President, thank you for doing this.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Thank you very much.

TERRY MORAN: Here in the Oval Office, it's -- it's special. A hundred days into your second term. So what's the one thing, just one thing, that you think is the most significant thing you've done so far in these 100 days?

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I think maybe the border is the most significant because our country was really going bad. They were allowing people to come in from prisons, as you know. And you've heard me say it, but you've heard a lot of people say it. Prisons, mental institutions, gang members -- murderers.

We had many murderers, 11,888, they think. Some murdered more than one person. So you had murderers coming in. You had everybody coming in. And not just South America. From all over the world, they were emptying their prisons into our country.

And now it's totally closed down. And you've seen just yesterday, they announced 99.9%. Nobody thought that could happen, and it happened quickly, very quickly. And I think that's very significant. But we're doing other things that are very significant.

Results will take a little bit longer because it's one of those -- you know, it's complicated. It's -- many years of trading abuse. We've been abused by other countries for years and years. They laughed at us. They thought we were stupid people, and we're fixing it. And -- I think that's gonna be very, very important. But I -- I would --

TERRY MORAN: We have a lot of ground to cover.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah. I would really say that -- that -- that the border is so important, you know? You just can't --

TERRY MORAN: And we'll get there. Immigration is huge --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: -- let that happen. Yeah.

TERRY MORAN: And we're gonna get there. But I wanna start --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Sure.

TERRY MORAN: -- with the economy, the number one issue for so many people, for just about everybody. It -- it's one of the main reasons that you're back in this office. And now we have this trade war with China that -- that Moody's and other analysts say is gonna cost American families thousands of more dollars per year. And there is a lot of concern out there. People are worried, even some people who voted for you, sayin', ""I didn't sign up for this."" So how do you answer those concerns?

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, they did sign up for it, actually. And this is what I campaigned on. I said that-- we've been abused by other countries at levels that nobody's ever seen before. We were losing $3 to 5 billion a day on trade. We were losing-- a trillion and a half to $2 trillion a year. Not sustainable.

They were takin' advantage of us like they've never -- I could've left it that way, and at some point there would've been an implosion like nobody's ever seen. But I said, ""No, we have to fix it."" I've -- I've wanted to do this for many years.

You know, I had the best economy during my first term. We had a tremendous economy, tremendous success. And we -- we did tremendous numbers of tariffs on -- we took in a lot of money from tariffs -- China in particular, hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs. We had no inflation, as you know. We had an incredible economy. We were given credit for a great economy. But I said, ""We have to fix this, otherwise it's just not self-sustaining.""

TERRY MORAN: Well, one of the things you ran on was you'd said you'd bring prices down on day one. And that --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And I have --

TERRY MORAN: -- it would happen fast. And that it would happen fast and --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I have.

TERRY MORAN: Many -- most economists will tell you that tariffs will raise prices. So don't your tariffs cut against that promise you made to bring prices down?

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, because I had massive tariffs on China, if you remember in my first term, and we had essentially no inflation. Like, around 1% inflation, which is, like, a perfect number. The -- and then when Biden took over it went through the roof.

It went to the -- probably the worst inflation we've ever had. I mean, we had an inflation nightmare. Now, if you look at what's happening now, we're only there for 100 days, as you say, and in 100 days we took over the -- we had bad inflation for four years, for two years of -- especially two years of his -- his administration. I would say record-setting like we've never seen. They say 48 years, the worst in 48 years. I'd say it was much worse than that --

TERRY MORAN: You lived through that, I lived through that, yeah.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Right. So -- so now if you look at what's happened -- energy is down. Gasoline hit $1.98 in a few states -- during the last couple of days. It was $3.50 and $4.00 and $4.50. But gasoline is way down. And when I took over, you remember the big thing with eggs?

They hit me the first week, ""Eggs, eggs, eggs,"" like it was my fault. I said, ""I didn't cause this problem. This problem was caused by Biden. What's the problem with eggs?"" And they said, ""They've doubled it."" Well, eggs are down 87% since I got involved.

TERRY MORAN: A lotta that is bird flu, right --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And by the way -- and there were plenty of eggs for Easter, which we just went through. There were plenty of eggs for Easter. They were saying, ""You won't have enough eggs for Easter."" We ended -- our sec -- my secretary did a fantastic job on eggs. Groceries are down. Everything's down --

TERRY MORAN: Okay.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Interest rates are the same. Interest rates should be down, but we have a Federal Reserve that wants to be stubborn. They wanna be cute --

TERRY MORAN: Alright, we'll get to that. A couple -- you said something a couple weeks ago that -- that struck me. You said, concerning the tariffs, which economists say are gonna raise prices, you said, quote, ""Hang tough. It won't be easy."" You said that to the American people. Is that what Americans should expect --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I've said that --

TERRY MORAN: -- some hard times?

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I've said that during --

TERRY MORAN: Because of these tariffs--

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: -- my campaign. Look, we won a campaign by a lot. We won all seven swing states. We won the popular vote by a lot. You know, we had a tremendous campaign. I said all of these things during my campaign. I said, ""You're gonna have a transition period."" We've been ripped off by every country all over the world. They're laughing at us. They thought we were stupid people, and we were. And I said, ""That's not gonna happen. We're not gonna let that happen"" --

TERRY MORAN: Hard times -- hard times are ahead?

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I don't think so. I think great --

TERRY MORAN: ""Hang tough"" --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: -- times are ahead. Look, since I came in gasoline is down, groceries are down, egg prices are down -- many things are down, just about everything. You know, you don't have the drop in -- in fuel and energy and oil like we did. I took it from maybe $3.20, maybe more than that, down into a low -- a much lower number. When you have that kind of a drop you're not gonna have inflation.

TERRY MORAN: Not now. But it's the tariffs, right? We still have 145% tariffs --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well --

TERRY MORAN: -- on China

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Why is it --

TERRY MORAN: Your Treasury secretary said we basically have an embargo on China.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Look, you're trying to --

TERRY MORAN: And that --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: -- say something's gonna happen, Terry --

TERRY MORAN: No, no, no, no. Okay, well, do you --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Nothing's gonna happen

TERRY MORAN: You know business. I wanna ask you --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Terry -- Terry --

TERRY MORAN: I wanna ask you.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I do know business. And --

TERRY MORAN: Yeah, so 145% tariffs on China. And -- and that is --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: That's good.

TERRY MORAN: -- basically --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: That's good.

TERRY MORAN: -- an embargo

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They deserve it.

TERRY MORAN: It'll raise prices on everything from--

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They deserve it.

TERRY MORAN: -- electronics to clothing to building houses.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You don't know that. You don't know whether or not China's gonna eat it --

TERRY MORAN: That's mathematics.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: China probably will eat those tariffs. But at 145, they basically can't do much business with the United States. And they were making from us a trillion dollars a year. They were ripping us off like nobody's ever ripped us off. And by the way, we have other countries that were just as bad. If you look at the European Union, it was terrible what they've done to us. Every country, almost every country in the world was ripping us off.

TERRY MORAN: But I --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They're not doing that anymore.

TERRY MORAN: I want you to think about the boom that this country has had in small businesses, mom-and-pops -- Etsy stores, small businesses that became --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Really? They haven't had a boom --

TERRY MORAN: -- big businesses

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: -- because of inflation.

TERRY MORAN: Well, your boom, what they've done --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The boom was inflationary boom. The people were wiped out with inflation. I mean, you read the news. You do the business stuff, I assume --

TERRY MORAN: Now they face -- now they -- they -- a lot of 'em built those businesses on the trading model before you --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah, and they're gonna make more money now

TERRY MORAN: They source their products overseas. And now they're looking at an extinction event --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I've been here.

TERRY MORAN: They're -- they're -- it's disaster for them.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I've been here for three months. I've taken a trade deficit down to a number that's very, very -- starting to get really good. I only -- I just got here. We had a country that -- it was not sustainable. What Biden did to this country, between -- the open borders where criminals poured into our country, between every country in the world ripping us off on trade, it was not sustainable.

TERRY MORAN: So your message to those small businesses who are saying, ""We can't live a month, two months with these tariffs,"" Apple got a big deal. Is there something for them?

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, no. Not only Apple. We've got $7-8 trillion being invested in our country in two months. Biden didn't have that over a year. I mean, if you look at Biden, nobody was really investing in this country. Everybody was ripping off our country. Apple's putting up $500 billion, but that's only one of many companies. Companies are flooding into our country right now.

TERRY MORAN: So your answer to the concern about the tariffs is, ""Everything's gonna be hunky-dory?""

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Everybody's gonna be just fine. It wouldn't have been if I didn't do this. I had a choice. I could leave it, have a nice, easy time. But I think ultimately you would've had an implosion. Our country had inflation that was worse than they've ever had it before.

You don't mention that. Why don't you mention that? We had the worst inflation probably in the history of our country. People say 48 years, probably in the history of our country we had the worst inflation. And people were dying over the inflation. You know that. Now the grocery prices are coming down. The energy prices are coming down. Gasoline's coming down. It's all heading in the right direction.

TERRY MORAN: Okay. Let's move on to immigration. And as you said, it is an undeniable fact that illegal crossings at the southern border have plummeted, a staggering decline. But there are questions about your methods, and so I want to ask you --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: About my message?

TERRY MORAN: Methods. About your methods, how you're accomplishing this --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, they seem to work.

TERRY MORAN: Do you acknowledge that under our law every single person who gets deported gets a hearing first to make their case?

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, are we talking about people that are citizens of our country or not?

TERRY MORAN: No, you're not deporting citizens, at this point.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, lemme ask you. Do they get hearings when -- when Biden allowed 21 million -- 'cause I think the number's 21, 20 million -- people to flow into our country? He had 21 million people that came into our country through a stupid open border.

And they were prisoners and they were -- people that you don't want, in many cases, in our country, right? They came from all over the world. They came from the Congo. They came from south -- they came from all over the world. We're talkin' about some of the roughest countries in the world -- they had -- they had here, including terrorists, by the way. Now --

TERRY MORAN: But the law --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Did we give them a hearing when they came in?

TERRY MORAN: Well, the law requires that every single person who is going to be deported gets a hearing first.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well --

TERRY MORAN: Do you acknowledge that?

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I'll -- I'll have to ask the lawyers about that. All I can say is this: If you're gonna have 21 million people, and if we have to get a lot of 'em out because they're criminals, we're gonna have to act fast. We can't -- do you think we can give 21 million trials? Let's say each trial takes two weeks. Is that what you want us to do --

TERRY MORAN: The law is the law, sir --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: -- give 21 million?

TERRY MORAN: The law is the law and you're sworn --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, no. The law doesn't say anything --

TERRY MORAN: -- to uphold it --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: -- about trials

TERRY MORAN: No, not trials. Hearings. I said hearings --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: If these people came in, they're not citizens, they came in illegally, they came into our country illegally, we have to --

TERRY MORAN: And they --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: -- get them out.

TERRY MORAN: There's a legal process for that.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I can't -- sure, and we follow the legal process. I can't -- I can't have a trial-- a major trial-- for every person that came in illegally, we have thousands of murderers that came in. They're gonna murder people. They already have murdered people in our country.

TERRY MORAN: Right, so --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We have to get 'em out--

TERRY MORAN: They're bad guys --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And we have to get 'em out fast.

TERRY MORAN: Really bad guys. But in our country even bad guys get due process, right?

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: If people come into our country illegally there's a different standard. These are illegal. They came in illegally.

TERRY MORAN: But they get due process.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, they get a process where we have to get 'em out, yeah.

TERRY MORAN: Okay. Let's talk about the Venezuelans.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They get whatever my lawyers say.

TERRY MORAN: Right. Alright, let's talk about the Venezuelans. You deported more than 200 Venezuelans to that prison in El Salvador. You -- you say they're -- they're violent. They're gang members. They're terrorists. Many of them don't have -- a criminal record --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They are, by the way.

TERRY MORAN: -- at all.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well -- I'm not so sure about that, if you take a look --

TERRY MORAN: I wanna -- I wanna read you something --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: When you -- excuse me. When you look at those -- those people, they were violent people. They were violent people --

TERRY MORAN: But many of them don't have a criminal record at this point --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Go ahead.

TERRY MORAN: I wanna read you something --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I mean, that's what you say.

TERRY MORAN: Well, it's based on -- their lawyer-- what their lawyers have said --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Go ahead. Go ahead.

TERRY MORAN: Joe Rogan said this. Joe Rogan, one of the leading podcasters, Trump supporter, about the deportation of Venezuelans. He said, quote, ""Rounding up gang members and shipping them to El Salvador with no due process,"" he said it was dangerous and added, quote, ""We gotta be careful that we don't become monsters while we're fighting monsters."" I -- is Joe Rogan --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I agree with that.

TERRY MORAN: -- right?

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Oh, I agree with that a hundred percent, yeah. We want to be careful. We are careful. We're doing something that has to be done. We have a country that's very sick. Joe Biden -- and it's not him, because I don't even think he knew what the hell was happening.

But the people around him are vicious people. And what they've done to the country is unbelievable. They've allowed 21 million people to pour into our country. Many of these people are criminals. They've allowed the -- you mention Venezuela -- the jails of Venezuela to be emptied into the United States.

Do you know Venezuela crime is way down? Way, way down. You know why? Because their criminals are now living happily in the United States of America, and we're getting 'em out. And I was elected to get 'em out, and we're getting 'em out --

TERRY MORAN: Under the law, it sounds like --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: -- getting them out fast, and we're getting them out legally. Now in some cases, we have judges. In some cases, they're radical left judges. What happened the other day, where a judge was protecting a criminal, was horrible.

TERRY MORAN: Mmm.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And I think she's got big problems, frankly --

TERRY MORAN: Probably. And talk about --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And there are a couple of them like that.

TERRY MORAN: I want to talk about one man --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Wait a minute.

TERRY MORAN: Yep.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We have to be treated fairly by judges. And we're not being treated fairly by all judges.

TERRY MORAN: Oh, that's a subject its -- so you're saying that you don't like some of the rulings, some of the --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I think --

TERRY MORAN: -- court orders?

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think the rulings will be overturned, yeah.

TERRY MORAN: Alright. Well, let me ask about one man and one court order. Kilmar Abrego Garcia. He's the Salvadoran man who crossed into this country illegally but who is under a protective order that he not be sent back to El Salvador. Your government sent him back to El Salvador and acknowledged in court that was a mistake. And now the Supreme Court has upheld an order that you must return him to the -- facilitate his return to the United States. What are you doing to comply?

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, the lawyer that said it was a mistake was here a long time, was not appointed by us -- should not have said that, should not have said that. And just so you understand --

TERRY MORAN: Said it in court. Said it in court --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: -- the person that you're talkin' about, you know, you're makin' this person sound -- this is a MS-13 gang member, a tough cookie, been in lots of skirmishes, beat the hell out of his wife, and the wife was petrified to even talk about him, okay? This is not an innocent, wonderful gentleman from Maryland --

TERRY MORAN: I'm not saying he's a good guy. It's about the rule of law. The order from the Supreme Court stands, sir --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: He came into our country illegally.

TERRY MORAN: You could get him back. There's a phone on this desk.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I could.

TERRY MORAN: You could pick it up, and with all --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I could

TERRY MORAN: -- the power of the presidency, you could call up the president of El Salvador and say, ""Send him back,"" right now.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And if he were the gentleman that you say he is, I would do that.

TERRY MORAN: But the court has ordered you --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But he's not.

TERRY MORAN: -- to facilitate that -- his release--

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I'm not the one making this decision. We have lawyers that don't want --

TERRY MORAN: You're the president.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: -- to do this, Terry --

TERRY MORAN: Yeah, but the -- but the buck stops in this office --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I -- no, no, no, no. I follow the law. You want me to follow the law. If I were the president that just wanted to do anything, I'd probably keep him right where he is --

TERRY MORAN: The Supreme Court says what the law is.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Listen. I was elected to take care of a problem that was -- it was -- a, a unforced error that was made by a very incompetent man, a man that turned out to be incompetent that you always said was wonderful, a great genius, right? And now you find out -- all of the media, now they're saying what a mistake they made. A man who was grossly incompetent allowed us to have open borders where millions of people flowed in --

TERRY MORAN: Alright.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I campaigned on that issue. I wouldn't say it was my number one issue, but it was pretty close.

TERRY MORAN: Right up there.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I campaigned on that issue. I've done an amazing job. I have closed borders. He said you couldn't do it, you wouldn't be able to do it, it would never happen. Well, it happened. And it happened --

TERRY MORAN: Alright.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: -- very quickly. Wait a minute. When we have criminals, murderers, criminals in this country, we have to get 'em out. And we're doing it.

TERRY MORAN: By law --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And you'll pick out one man, but even the man that you picked out --

TERRY MORAN: He's got --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: -- he said he'd -- wasn't a member of a gang. And then they looked, and --

TERRY MORAN: Alright.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: On his knuckles -- he had MS-13 --

TERRY MORAN: Alright. There's dis -- there's a dispute over that --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, wait a minute. Wait a minute. He had MS-13 --

TERRY MORAN: Well --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: -- on his knuckles tattooed.

TERRY MORAN: -- he -- he -- he -- it didn't say-- oh, he had some tattoos that are inper -- interpreted that way. But let's move on

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Wait a minute.

TERRY MORAN: I want --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Hey, Terry. Terry. Terry.

TERRY MORAN: He -- he did not have the letter --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Don't do that -- M-S-1-3 -- It says M-S-one-three.

TERRY MORAN: I -- that was Photoshop. So let me just--

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: That was Photoshop? Terry, you can't do that -- he had --

-- he-- hey, they're givin' you the big break of a lifetime. You know, you're doin' the interview. I picked you because -- frankly I never heard of you, but that's okay --

TERRY MORAN: This -- I knew this would come --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But I picked you -- Terry -- but you're not being very nice. He had MS-13 tattooed --

TERRY MORAN: Alright. Alright. We'll agree to disagree. I want to move on --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Terry.

TERRY MORAN: -- to something else.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Terry. Do you want me to show the picture?

TERRY MORAN: I saw the picture. We'll -- we'll -- we'll agree to disagree --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Oh, and you think it was Photoshop. Well --

TERRY MORAN: Here we go. Here we go.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: -- don't Photoshop it. Go look --

TERRY MORAN: Alright.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: -- at his hand. He had MS-13 --

TERRY MORAN: Fair enough, he did have tattoos that can be interpreted that way. I'm not an expert on them.

I want to turn to Ukraine, sir --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, no. Terry --

TERRY MORAN: I-- I want to get to Ukraine--

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Terry, no, no. No, no. He had MS as clear as you can be. Not ""interpreted."" This is why people --

TERRY MORAN: Alright.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: -- no longer believe --

TERRY MORAN: Well.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: -- the news, because it's fake news --

TERRY MORAN: When he was photographed in El Sal -- in-- in El Salvador, they aren't there. But let's just go on --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: He is --

TERRY MORAN: They aren't there when he's in El Salvador.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --there -- oh, oh, they weren't there --

TERRY MORAN: Take a look at the photograph --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But they're there now, right?

TERRY MORAN: No. What --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But they're there now?

TERRY MORAN: They're in your picture.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Terry.

TERRY MORAN: Ukraine, sir.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: He's got MS-13 on his knuckles.

TERRY MORAN: Alright. I --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Okay?

TERRY MORAN: -- we'll -- we'll take a look at it --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It's -- it's -- you do such a disservice --

TERRY MORAN: We'll take a look. We'll take a look at that, sir --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Why don't you just say, ""Yes, he does,"" and, you know, go on to something else --

TERRY MORAN: It's contested. Ukraine. I want to turn -- I was just in Rome, and to that moving photograph of you and President Zelenskyy sitting in St. Peter's Basilica --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah.

TERRY MORAN: -- talking peace. It went around the world.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Sure.

TERRY MORAN: Take us into that moment.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, look, the Ukraine is a very serious, very tough situation. And this is Biden's war. This is not my war. But I want to see if I can solve it, because probably close to 5,000 young soldiers a week are being killed, Russian and Ukrainian. We also spend a tremendous amount of money in Ukraine, and Europe should be spending much more than us. They're not. They're spending much less. It's been badly handled by the Biden administration. It's been badly handled all the way around, all the way around --

TERRY MORAN: But that -- that moment.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The moment was a moment of solace in a sense, because -- tremendous numbers of people are dying. A lot of his people are dying. They're being killed. And I feel very badly about it. I feel very badly about -- that's a war that would have never happened if I were president, and it didn't happen for four years. It was never even a thought of it happening.

TERRY MORAN: It -- it does feel like something's happening. After that meeting with Zelenskyy in St. Peter's, you posted this on social media. ""There was no reason for Putin to be shooting missiles into civilian areas, in cities and towns, over the last few days. It makes me think that maybe"" --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah, well, that was part of my post. But you're right. That was -- that was part of a post, yes --

TERRY MORAN: And it says, ""It makes me think that maybe he doesn't want to stop the war. He's just tapping me along--""

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It's possible. Yeah, that's possible. Sure.

TERRY MORAN: ""He might be --""

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: He could be tapping me along a little bit. I would say that he would like to stop the war. I think that --

TERRY MORAN: You believe that?

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: -- if -- if it weren't for me, I think he'd want to take over the whole country, personally. I always felt -- so when I left, there wasn't even a chance that this would happen. When Biden got involved, I won't say whether or not he handled it properly, but obviously it wasn't good, because the war started.

Putin went in. The war started. I believe that Putin wanted to get all of Ukraine once he went in. And I think part of the reason he went in is he saw what happened in Afghanistan, how incompetent -- how incompetently Milley and all these guys handled that. It was one of the greatest embarrassments of -- of our lifetimes but maybe in the history of our country. Okay. So Putin went in. I think Putin wanted all of Ukraine.

TERRY MORAN: Right.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think if I didn't win the election, he would have gotten all of Ukraine. I think he would have taken all of Ukraine.

TERRY MORAN: From --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think his first choice -- never with me. He would have never gone in. With this group of losers, he went in. He saw what happened in Afghanistan. He said, ""Wow, this is my chance,"" because it was always the apple of his eye. I talked to him. Ukraine was the apple of his eye. I think he wanted the whole country.

TERRY MORAN: You've said for months that --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And because of me, I do believe that --

TERRY MORAN: Yeah. Yeah.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: -- he's willing to stop the fighting. Don't forget --

TERRY MORAN: You think he wants peace?

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: -- this is --

TERRY MORAN: You think Vladimir Putin wants peace?

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think he does, yes. I think he does--

TERRY MORAN: Still?

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think because of me --

TERRY MORAN: Even with the raining missiles on --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think he really -- his -- his -- his dream was to take over the whole country. I think because of me, he's not gonna do that.

TERRY MORAN: Do you trust him?

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think --

TERRY MORAN: Do you trust him?

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I don't trust you. I don't trust -- I don't trust a lot of people. I don't trust you. Look at you. You come in all shootin' for bear. You're so happy to do the interview.

TERRY MORAN: I am happy --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And then you start hitting me with fake questions. You start tellin' me that a guy -- whose hand is covered with a tattoo --

TERRY MORAN: Alright. We're back to that.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: -- doesn't have the tattoo, you know.

TERRY MORAN: Alright.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I mean, you're being dishonest.

TERRY MORAN: No, I'm not --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Let -- let-- let me just tell you --

TERRY MORAN: No, I am not, sir.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Do I trust -- I don't trust a lot of people. But I do think this. I think that he -- let's say he respects me. And I believe because of me he's not gonna take over the whole -- but his decision, his choice would be to take over all of Ukraine.

TERRY MORAN: Okay.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It's a war that never should have happened. It did happen because of incompetent people --

TERRY MORAN: Last question on this.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But it never should have happened.

TERRY MORAN: If there's no peace deal, will the U.S. cut off military aid to Ukraine?

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I don't want to tell you that. I'm not gonna tell you whether or not I would or not --

TERRY MORAN: That sounds --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I want to leave that as a big, fat secret, because I don't want to ruin a negotiation. But --

TERRY MORAN: I'd be worried if I were Ukraine.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: -- I will tell you I was not happy when I saw Putin shooting missiles into a few towns and cities. And -- that was not something that I liked seeing, and I thought it was inappropriate. But I think the whole war is inappropriate.

TERRY MORAN: Okay.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Again, it's a war that shouldn't have happened. This war is a war that if the election weren't rigged -- and it was totally rigged, the 2020 election -- if it weren't rigged, you wouldn't have that. You wouldn't have had the embarrassment --

TERRY MORAN: Okay.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: -- of Afghanistan.

TERRY MORAN: Got it.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You wouldn't have October 7th with Is --

TERRY MORAN: Got it.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --Israel. You wouldn't have had any of the problems that you have right now --

TERRY MORAN: Thank you. I want to ask one question --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And you wouldn't have had inflation either.

TERRY MORAN: Alright. I want to ask one question about Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. There's a lot of turmoil -- at the -- at the Pentagon right now. There's the Signal chat with his wife on it where he's discussing that attack in Yemen. There's another Signal chat -- discussing the attack on Yemen.

There's a reporter accidentally involved. You said the other day that you had a talk with the secretary. Did you take him to the woodshed?

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I had a talk with him, and whatever I said I probably wouldn't be inclined to tell you. Bu t-- we had a good talk. He's a talented guy. He's young. He's smart, highly educated. And I think he's gonna be a very good defense -- hopefully a great defense secretary, but he'll be a very good defense secretary --

TERRY MORAN: You have a hundred percent confidence in Pete Hegseth?

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I don't have -- a hundred percent confidence in anything, okay? Anything. Do I have a hundred percent? It's a stupid question. Look --

TERRY MORAN: It's a pretty important position.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: -- I have -- no, no, no. You don't have a hundred percent. Only a liar would say, ""I have a hundred percent confidence."" I don't have a hundred percent confidence that we're gonna finish this interview.

TERRY MORAN: We will.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Let's go.

TERRY MORAN: Elon Musk and DOGE. Everyone knows that there's wasteful government spending. It's really important. But the cuts have had some serious consequences. There have been cuts to foreign aid programs that save lives and keep people alive overseas. There's been research at the National Institutes of Health on cancer, on Alzheimer's that has had to be stopped. And- - the question I think people have is: Did DOGE go too far, too fast, too recklessly?

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, I think DOGE has been, look, saved $150 billion. Billion. We saved -- that's a lot of money. There's also a lot of things right now under investigation, which is gonna increase that amount by a lot. And that's a tremendous amount of money. There were some things where when I heard about 'em I -- I put 'em back, as you know. There are things that I'm considering right now putting back. But overall, we've saved hundreds of billions of dollars of --

TERRY MORAN: Well, the original promise was $2 trillion, went to $1 trillion. Now, it's $150 billion --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I don't know --

TERRY MORAN: -- and heading south.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You don't know what it's gonna be because we have things that are very -- at a very high level that are being looked at right now. We also found tremendous waste, fraud, and abuse, as you know.

We found a lot of fraud. There was a lot of fraud. Fraudulent things were taking place, and we ended that, and those people are gonna be suffering --

TERRY MORAN: Just --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: -- because of it.

TERRY MORAN: -- a legal note. Fraud is a crime. There have been no referrals to the Justice Department on any of this --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, you don't know that, do you? How do you know that?

TERRY MORAN: Have there been referrals --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: How do you know that --

TERRY MORAN: -- to the -- are there criminal referrals --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Why -- how would you know that, that there were no referrals? I think there--

TERRY MORAN: There's -- there's --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: -- were referrals.

TERRY MORAN: They generally -- alright. There's been no investigation from the Justice Department --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: How do you know that?

TERRY MORAN: I'm asking you, sir.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, you're not askin' me. You made a statement. You're not asking me --

TERRY MORAN: Now, I'm asking you.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: That was a statement that you made. There have been --

TERRY MORAN: Now, I'm asking.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Have there been? Yes, there have.

TERRY MORAN: So there have been referrals for fraud from the work of DOGE?

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Of course there have been. Take a look at some of these things --

TERRY MORAN: Alright. Alright.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: -- that took place. Millions of dollars were given to people for no reason whatsoever. Of course there have been.

TERRY MORAN: I want to bring up -- what is truly one of -- to a lot of people, one of the biggest achievements of your first term. That is Operation Warp Speed. You got that COVID vaccine up and going --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: That's right.

TERRY MORAN: -- and distributed. And a lotta people took it, and a lotta people that feel their lives have been saved by it. Now, we have this measles outbreak, biggest in a decade -- in Texas, and it's because people aren't getting their children vaccinated. Do you recommend to parents that they get their children vaccinated for measles?

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I recommend the governors to make the decisions. You have a very talented governor of Texas, and he's making decisions, and those decisions are gonna be made rapidly. This is a very much different thing than COVID in terms of rap -- rapidity and speed and other things.

Measles have been with us a long time. And I'm not saying good, bad, or indifferent. I'm just saying that -- the governors are making the decision. It's a federalist decision --

TERRY MORAN: So you're -- the president is -- is our leader in so many ways, and your voice counts so much. And you can't tell moms and dads, you know, it's a good thing --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Oh, sure. I rec --

TERRY MORAN: -- to get a measles vaccine?

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Do I recommend it?

TERRY MORAN: Yes.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yes, I do. I recommend it. Yeah.

TERRY MORAN: Got it. That was my question --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Do I mandate it? No.

TERRY MORAN: No. No, I didn't ask --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But I do recommend it, yes --

TERRY MORAN: Good. Do you think your --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And I have recommended it.

TERRY MORAN: Do you think the secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has a history of at the very least vaccine skepticism -- do you think Kennedy recommends the measles vaccines?

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: He did. He did. He recommended it. Yeah, he did. He recommended it --

TERRY MORAN: Are you satisfied with his --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah, I mean, he --

TERRY MORAN: -- response on this?

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: -- recommended that they go out and get the vaccine. Yeah.

TERRY MORAN: Okay. I want to talk a little bit about presidential power, the powers that you have in the presidency- - temporarily that the American people ha -- have given you, right? You've revoked a lot of people's security clearances. You've revoked people's security details who are -- still threatened, you know, with death threats. You've gone after law firms because they've employed people you don't like or they have represented people that you don't like --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, they obviously agreed because they paid me a lotta money.

TERRY MORAN: Well, the reason they agreed is because you were threatening to destroy their business with your executive order that said, ""You can't represent clients before the federal government."" That's--

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well -- These are big --

TERRY MORAN: That's their bread and butter --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: These are big boys. These are big -- these are the biggest, most powerful lawyers. These are not people that --

TERRY MORAN: You got a lotta leverage as president --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: -- are easily intimidated.

TERRY MORAN: As president, you've got all the cards.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And they paid hundreds of millions of dollars because they felt -- I guess they probably felt they did something wrong, you know --

TERRY MORAN: It was for survival, sir. You --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, it isn't. These --

TERRY MORAN: You were crushing their business --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: These -- these firms are very powerful firms, and there's 15 of them. And these are firms that -- probably-- look, you have to ask them. In fact, this is a separate story. You have to ask them, ""Why did you all pay Trump hundreds of millions of dollars in services, et cetera? Why did you do that?"" I don't know.

TERRY MORAN: You don't think that factored --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We -- we -- we have a clause in the thing that, ""While we admit no wrongdoing."" But, you know, it's like one of those things. And now I'm friendly with those firms. But it's -- you know, these are the most powerful firms in the world.

And they just signed whatever I put in front of 'em. I've never seen anything like it. I'm-- I'm actually surprised myself in a certain way. But they obviously felt they probably did something wrong. I guess that's why they signed.

TERRY MORAN: I guess the question out of that is the concern that people have: Are -- are you using your powers as president to get personal revenge?

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No. I'll tell you what -- I tell you what you sh -- not -- you're really not asking and you should be asking. There has never been a president in this country in the history that was persecuted like I was persecuted by really crooked people. Dishonest, horrible people. And it's been proven.

So when you say I'm treating people rough, I'm not treating people rough. I was treated worse than any president in the history of our country. And, you know, people figured, ""Well, maybe that's it. Finally we got-- you know, he's leaving town. There goes the helicopter.""

And then I came back. And -- I came back because I have tremendous support. You know, when you win an election like I won it -- and you will admit: I won all seven swing states. I won the popular vote. I won -- 700 of -- let's say 2,750 districts compared to 500 districts. That's why the map is all red. And those people feel that I was treated unfairly.

TERRY MORAN: But does that give you the right to go after your political opponents with the powers of this office --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I don't go after -- I don't go -- I'm going after -- all I'm doing -- hey, Biden did something to me --

TERRY MORAN: So --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --a nd I did something to Biden. And you know why I did it? 'Cause he's grossly incompetent. That's not a man that should be allowed to, you know, be lookin' at things that are very confidential.

TERRY MORAN: But what about --71 people you've revoked their --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Here's a man that used an autopen to sign very important documents. Now, who really is -- do -- do you think he knew what -- that they were using an autopen? I mean, he used an autopen to sign very, very important documents. And so those are really the questions you should be asking: ""What do you think of the autopen? Who wielded the autopen?"" Because -- whoever that person was, think of it. Whoever the person that wielded the autopen, he was really the president of the United States.

TERRY MORAN: You are the president, right.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I don't think that Biden knew anything about it --

TERRY MORAN: Okay, fair enough. But you are the president now. And I'm asking the justification for going after people you don't like.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Uh. No, no.

TERRY MORAN: That is the --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: People that I think are dishonest. It's not that I don't -- I don't even know most of 'em. They're people that I think are dis --

TERRY MORAN: These are people that made you angry.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No-- it's not anger. These are people that I think are very dishonest. I don't think they're worthy of being able to go into top-secret information. I think that's fine. And Biden did that with many of our people. But when you look at it -- these are people that I don't think are worthy. That's my decision. It's not a question of anger.

TERRY MORAN: Okay. I understand you just had a phone call with the new Canadian premier. And they just had this election. You were a big issue in it. And Canadians, many of them, are really angry, furious, about your talk about, ""We're gonna take over Canada. It's gonna become the 51st state--""

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: That’s their prerogative.

TERRY MORAN: And it kind of is of a piece -- a lotta -- travel is down into the United States from around the world.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We're doing great --

TERRY MORAN: Feels like there's been reputational damage --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The country's doing great.

TERRY MORAN: Well --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Prices are down.

TERRY MORAN: Not the tourism industry --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Gasoline's down. Energy's down. Tourism is gonna be way up. Wait till you see the numbers. The tourism is way up.

TERRY MORAN: Not now.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Now, Canada -- oh, sure -- tourism's doing very well. We're doing very well. We're doing very well. Wait till you see the real numbers come out in about -- in six months from now wait till you see the numbers.

TERRY MORAN: But do you think --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They're gonna be very good --

TERRY MORAN: I'm gonna ask -- if I may, do you think the reputation of the United States has gone down under your presidency?

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I -- no, I think it's gone way up, and I think we're a respected country again. We were laughed at all over the world. We had -- a president that couldn't walk up a flight of stairs, couldn't walk down a flight of stairs, couldn't walk across a stage without falling. We had a president that was grossly incompetent. You knew it, I knew it, and everybody knew it. But you guys didn't want to write it because you're fake news.

TERRY MORAN: Alright. Thank you --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And, by the way, ABC is one of the worst. I have to be honest with you --

TERRY MORAN: Okay. Thank you for the opinion. But more importantly, thank you for having us here. I have one more question.

It's a big one. It's a question that you know a lot of people have out there. What do you say to people who are concerned you are taking, seizing too much power and becoming an authoritarian president like we haven't had before?

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, I -- I would hate them to think that. I'm doing one thing: I'm makin' America great again. We have a country that was failing. We have a country that was laughed at all over the world. We had a leader that was grossly incompetent. He should have never been there.

The election was rigged. He shoulda never been there. Our country suffered greatly, and now our country's coming back like nobody can believe. I have editorials just today where they're saying they've never seen anything like it. They love it. Our country's coming back, and we're respected again.

TERRY MORAN: Mr. President, thank you.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Thank you, Terry, very much.

Donald Trump,NA,"Transcript of the 2025 Trump–Zelenskyy meeting - Wikisource, the free online library","This transcript covers the last 10 decisive minutes of the 50 minutes Trump–Zelenskyy meeting on February 28, 2025 (11 a.m.) in the Oval Office. The talking participants were US President Donald Trump, US Vice President JD Vance, and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as well as members of the press.

Vance: “For four years, the United States of America, we had a president (Joe Biden) who stood up at press conferences and talked tough about Vladimir Putin, and then Putin invaded Ukraine and destroyed a significant chunk of the country. The path to peace and the path to prosperity is, maybe, engaging in diplomacy. We tried the pathway of Joe Biden, of thumping our chest and pretending that the president of the United States’ words mattered more than the president of the United States’ actions. What makes America a good country is America engaging in diplomacy. That’s what President Trump is doing.”

Zelenskyy: “Can I ask you?”

Vance: “Sure. Yeah.”

Zelenskyy: “OK. So he (Putin) occupied it, our parts, big parts of Ukraine, parts of east and Crimea. So he occupied it in 2014. So during a lot of years — I’m not speaking about just Biden, but those times was Obama, President (Barack) Obama, then President Trump, then President Biden, now President Trump, and God bless, now, President Trump will stop him — but during 2014, nobody stopped him. He just occupied and took. He killed people. You know what the contact line —""

Trump: “2015?”

Zelenskyy: “2014.”

Trump: “Oh, 2014? I was not here.”

Vance: “That’s exactly right.”

Zelenskyy: “Yes, but during 2014 ‘til 2022, the situation was the same, that people have been dying on the contact line. Nobody stopped him. You know that we had conversations with him, a lot of conversations, my bilateral conversation. And we signed with him, me and you, president, in 2019, I signed with him the deal. I signed with him, (French President Emmanuel) Macron and (former German Chancellor Angela) Merkel. We signed a ceasefire. Ceasefire! All of them told me that he will never go. We signed him a gas contract. But after that, he broke the ceasefire, he killed our people, and he didn’t exchange prisoners. We signed the exchange of prisoners! But he didn’t do it. What kind of diplomacy, JD, you are speaking about? What do you mean?”

Vance: “I’m talking about the kind of diplomacy that’s going to end the destruction of your country. Mr. President, with respect, I think it’s disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office to try to litigate this in front of the American media. Right now, you guys are going around and forcing conscripts to the front lines because you have manpower problems. You should be thanking the president for trying to bring an end to this conflict.”

Zelenskyy: “Have you ever been to Ukraine that you say what problems we have?”

Vance: “I have been to–”

Zelenskyy: “Come once.”

Vance: “I’ve actually watched and seen the stories, and I know that what happens is you bring people, you bring them on a propaganda tour, Mr. President. Do you disagree that you’ve had problems, bringing people into your military?”

Zelenskyy: “We have problems–”

Vance: “And do you think that is respectful to come to the Oval Office of the United States of America and attack the administration that is trying to prevent the destruction of your country?”

Zelenskyy: “A lot of questions. Let’s start from the beginning.”

Vance: “Sure.”

Zelenskyy: “First of all, during the war, everybody has problems, even you. But you have nice ocean and don’t feel now. But you will feel it in the future. God bless–”

Trump: “You don’t know that. You don’t know that.”

Zelenskyy: “...god bless, you are not in a war.”

Trump: “Don’t tell us what we’re going to feel. We’re trying to solve a problem. Don’t tell us what we’re going to feel–”

Zelenskyy: “I’m not telling you. I am answering on these questions.”

Trump: “...because you’re in no position to dictate that.”

Vance: “That’s exactly what you’re doing.”

Trump (angry): “You are in no position to dictate what we’re going to feel! We’re going to feel very good.”

Zelenskyy: “You will feel influenced.”

Trump: “We are going to feel very good and very strong.”

Zelenskyy: “I am telling you. You will feel influenced.”

Trump: “You’re, right now, not in a very good position. You’ve allowed yourself to be in a very bad position –”

Zelenskyy: “From the very beginning of the war—”

Trump: “You’re not in a good position. You don’t have the cards right now. With us, you start having cards.”

Zelenskyy: “I’m not playing cards. I’m very serious, Mr. President. I’m very serious.”

Trump (loudly): “You’re playing cards. You’re gambling with the lives of millions of people. You’re gambling with World War III!”

Zelenskyy: “What are you speaking about?”

Trump: “You’re gambling with World War III! And what you’re doing is very disrespectful to the country, this country that’s backed you far more than a lot of people said they should have.”

Zelenskyy: “I am very in respect with your country!”

Vance: “Have you said thank you once?”

Zelenskyy: “A lot of times! Even today.”

Vance: “No, in this entire meeting, you said thank you? You went to Pennsylvania and campaigned for the opposition in October.”

Zelenskyy: “No. What are you speaking about?”

Vance: “Offer some words of appreciation for the United States of America and the president who’s trying to save your country.”

Zelenskyy: “Please. You think that if you will speak very loudly about the war, you can –”

Trump: “He’s not speaking loudly. He’s not speaking loudly. Your country is in big trouble.”

Zelenskyy: “Can I answer?”

Trump: “No, no. You’ve done a lot of talking. Your country is in big trouble.”

Zelenskyy: “I know. I know.”

Trump: “You’re not winning. You’re not winning this. You have a damn good chance of coming out OK because of us.”

Zelenskyy: “Mr. President, we are staying in our country, staying strong. From the very beginning of the war, we’ve been alone. And we are thankful. I said thanks in this cabinet.”

Trump (loudly talking over Zelenskyy): “You haven’t been alone. We gave you through a stupid president 350 billion dollars. We gave you military equipment. You may have been brave but they used our military equipment.”

Zelenskyy: “What about are we speaking? You invited me to speak –”

Trump: “If you didn’t have our military equipment, this war would have been over in two weeks.”

Zelenskyy (sarcastic): “In three days. I heard it from Putin. In three days.”

Trump: “Maybe less.”

Zelenskyy (sarcastic): “Of course, yes.”

Trump: “It’s going to be a very hard thing to do business like this, I tell you.

Vance: “Just say thank you.”

Zelenskyy: “I said a lot of times! Thank you, to American people.”

Vance: “Accept that there are disagreements, and let’s go litigate those disagreements rather than trying to fight it out in the American media when you’re wrong. We know that you’re wrong.”

Trump: “But you see, I think it’s good for the American people to see what’s going on. I think it’s very important. That’s why I kept this going so long. You have to be thankful.”

Zelenskyy: “I am thankful.”

Trump (talking over Zelenskyy): “You don’t have the cards! You’re buried there. People are dying. You’re running low on soldiers. It would be a damn good thing, and then you tell us, ‘I don’t want a ceasefire. I don’t want a ceasefire, I want to go, and I want this.’ Look, if you can get a ceasefire right now, I tell you, you take it so the bullets stop flying and your men stop getting killed.”

Zelenskyy: “Of course we want to stop the war.”

Trump: “Are you saying you don’t want a ceasefire? I want a ceasefire. Because you’ll get a ceasefire faster than an agreement.”

Zelenskyy: “But I said to you, with guarantees. Ask our people about a ceasefire, what they think.”

Trump: “That wasn’t with me. That was with a guy named Biden, who is not a smart person.”

Zelenskyy: “This is your president. It was your president.”

Trump: “Excuse me. That was with Obama, who gave you sheets, and I gave you Javelins. I gave you the Javelins to take out all those tanks. Obama gave you sheets. In fact, the statement is ‘Obama gave sheets, and Trump gave Javelins’. You’ve got to be more thankful, because let me tell you, you don’t have the cards. With us, you have the cards, but without us, you don’t have any cards.”

Reporter: “One more question to Mr Vice President, I’m sorry –”

Trump: “It’s going to be a tough deal to make. Because the attitudes have to change.”

Reporter: “What if Russia breaks ceasefire? What if Russia breaks peace talks? What do you do then? I understand that it’s a heated conversation right now –”

Trump: “What are you saying?”

Vance: “She is asking what if Russia breaks the ceasefire.”

Trump: “What, if anything? What if a bomb drops on your head right now? Okay, what if they broke it? I don’t know! They broke it with Biden, because Biden – they didn’t respect him. They didn’t respect Obama. They respect me! Let me tell you, Putin went through a hell of a lot with me. He went through a phony witch hunt (referring to the Russiagate scandal), where they used him and Russia. ‘Russia, Russia, Russia!’ You ever heared of that deal? That was a phony Hunter Biden, Joe Biden scam! Hillary Clinton, shifty Adam Schiff. It was a Democrat scam! And he had to go through that, and he did go through it. We didn’t end up in a war. And he went through it. He was accused of all that stuff, he had nothing to do with it. It came out of Hunter Biden’s bathroom, it came out of Hunter Biden’s bedroom. It was disgusting! And then they said ‘Oh, the laptop from hell was made by Russia’, the 51 agents. The whole thing was a scam and he had to put up with that. He was being accused of all that stuff. All I can say is this: He might have broken deals with Obama and Bush, and he might have broken them with Biden. He did, maybe. Maybe he did. I don’t know what happened. But he didn’t break them with me. He wants to make a deal. I don’t know if you can make a deal. The problem is, I’ve empowered you (turning toward Zelenskyy) to be a tough guy, and I don’t think you’d be a tough guy without the United States. And your people are very brave. But you’re either going to make a deal or we’re out. And if we’re out, you’ll fight it out. I don’t think it’s going to be pretty, but you’ll fight it out. But you don’t have the cards. But once we sign that deal, you’re in a much better position. But you’re not acting at all thankful. And that’s not a nice thing. I’ll be honest, that’s not a nice thing. All right, I think we’ve seen enough. What do you think? This is going to be great television, I will say that. We will see what we can do about putting it together. Thank you.”",https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Transcript_of_the_2025_Trump–Zelenskyy_meeting

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

JONATHAN KARL, ABC “THIS WEEK” ANCHOR: Allegations of conspiracy and cover-up. Some of President Trump's most outspoken supporters are now turning on his attorney general.

MAGA backlash over the Jeffrey Epstein investigation.

THIS WEEK starts right now.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Are you still talking about Jeffrey Epstein? Are people still talking about this guy? This creep?

KARL: The Justice Department's Epstein memo this week sparks a MAGA eruption. Could a top administration official now be on the way out? What about the attorney general?

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Who would you guys prefer, Bongino or Bondi?

KARL: Pierre Thomas has the latest from the Justice Department. And Chris Christie and Sarah Isgur on the political fallout.

Pressure campaign.

HOWARD LUTNICK, COMMERCE SECRETARY: The president is driving his agenda. This is his agenda.

KARL: President Trump announces new tariffs on America’s allies and renews his attacks on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Is he about to be fired? Top White House Economic Adviser Kevin Hassett joins me live.

And, changing his tune.

TRUMP: And I'm not happy with Putin. I can tell you that much right now. Because he's killing a lot of people.

KARL: The president loses his patience with Vladimir Putin and resumes military aid to Ukraine. Martha Raddatz and Susan Glasser on the changing dynamics and what it means for the war in Ukraine.

And sources say FEMA failed to answer thousands of calls from flood victims in Texas. That and more with the roundtable.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

ANNOUNCER: From ABC News, it's THIS WEEK. Here now, Jonathan Karl.

KARL: Good morning. Welcome to THIS WEEK.

We begin with the controversy roiling the leadership of the Justice Department. It's an uproar that has pitted the leaders of the DOJ and the FBI, and possibly the president himself, against some of the most prominent voices in the MAGA movement. Just this weekend some of Trump's allies were in open revolt, demanding the resignation of Attorney General Pam Bondi, and accusing her of taking part in a cover-up.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

MEGYN KELLY, AMERICAN JOURNALIST: I don't think he realizes how much she's humiliated the administration. This is a self-inflicted wound. She caused it. Again, I have nothing against Pam Bondi. But if you want to look for the villain in this story, we have found her.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

KARL: This is about the administration's handling of the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein. He was the financier and convicted sex trafficker who was found dead in his jail cell after an apparent suicide in August of 2019. For years, many Trump allies, including his now FBI director, Kash Patel, pushed for the release of the government files on the Epstein case, suggesting they would implicate prominent Americans in a sinister plot.

KASH PATEL, FBI DIRECTOR (December 2023): What the hell are the House Republicans doing? They have the majority. You can't get the list? Put on your big boy pants and let us know who the pedophiles are.

DAN BONGINO, FBI DEPUTY DIRECTOR (2019): The questions surrounding this alleged suicide are numerous and are worth entertaining and worth getting to the bottom of, quickly.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

KARL: That was Dan Bongino, the former MAGA social media star who is now the deputy director of the FBI. He hasn't been seen at FBI headquarters in days. And some of his allies say he may resign after he had a heated argument at the White House with the attorney general and White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles over how the administration has handled the case, sources familiar with the matter tell ABC News.

It was Bondi who raised expectations earlier this year that the full DOJ and FBI files on Epstein would be released.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

JOHN ROBERTS, ABC NEWS ANCHOR: The DOJ may be releasing the list of Jeffrey Epstein’s clients? Will that really happen?

PAM BONDI, ATTORNEY GENERAL: It's sitting on my desk right now to review. That's been a directive by President Trump.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

KARL: Days later, a group of far-right social media figures walked out of the West Wing of the White House with binders labelled “Epstein Investigation Files” that Bondi said contained, quote, “a lot of information.” But it turned out there was no new information in those files, no client list. They were full of previously released and heavily redacted records.

Bondi then sent a letter to the FBI demanding the full and complete Epstein files be sent to her office and suggested prosecutors in New York were withholding thousands of pages of documents.

In May, Bondi claimed the FBI was reviewing tens of thousands of videos of Epstein, further raising expectations about what would be released.

And now, the big reversal. First, FBI Director Kash Patel poured cold water on the Epstein conspiracy theory in an interview last month.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

KASH PATEL, FBI DIRECTOR (June 6, 2025): We've reviewed all the information and the American public is going to get as much as we can release. He killed himself. Do you think -- let's play out the logical conclusion of this. Do you think that myself, Bongino and others would participate in hiding information about Epstein’s grotesque activities?

(END VIDEO CLIP)

KARL: And last week, an undated and unsigned memo, the Justice Department and FBI announced the end of its investigation, writing that a review found, quote, “no incriminating client list,” and, quote, “no credible evidence” that Epstein blackmailed anyone, and confirming that, yes, he died by suicide.

As for what Bondi said about the, quote, “Epstein client list,” here's what she's saying now.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

PAM BONDI, ATTORNEY GENERAL: I was asked a question about the client list, and my response was, it's sitting on my desk to be reviewed, meaning the file, along with the JFK, MLK files as well. That's what I meant by that.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

KARL: The memo, and Bondi’s comments, didn't put out the right-wing fury over the Epstein case, but it seemed to make it burn brighter, leading to calls for Bondi’s resignation and ominous warnings about the future of Trump's movement.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (July 10, 2025): We need an attorney general who isn't going to lie, who isn't going to be addicted to going on Fox News, and who isn't going to jeopardize mid-term elections and cause President Trump to hemorrhage support from the base.

STEVE BANNON (July 11, 2025): The Epstein situation shows us one central thing, who runs the country. Either the people run the country, right, or the deep state runs the country.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

KARL: And where is the president in all of this? Trump, like many other New York celebrities, had some association with Epstein. You've probably seen this video of Trump with Epstein back in 1992. Decades later, when Epstein was arrested in 2019, Trump said that he and Epstein previously had a falling out and had not spoken in 15 years. And he suggested last year that he believed Epstein did probably kill himself.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TUCKER CARLSON, AMERICAN JOURNALIST (August 2023): Do you think it's possible that Epstein was killed?

TRUMP: Oh, sure. Possible. I mean I don’t really believe -- I think he probably committed suicide.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

KARL: Trump came to Bondi’s defense overnight, posting on social media that she “is doing a fantastic job.” He also urged his followers to, quote, “not waste time and energy on Jeffrey Epstein,” claiming, without evidence, that Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, among others, created the Epstein files. And he directed the FBI to investigate other matters, including the 2020 election results.

So, where does this all leave the Justice Department? We're joined now by ABC's chief justice correspondent Pierre Thomas.

All right, Pierre, you’ve got some remarkable reporting on this confrontation that Bondi had with Bongino in the presence of the chief of staff at the White House on Wednesday.

PIERRE THOMAS, ABC NEWS CHIEF JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Well, Jon, let me be clear, there's always a natural tension between the Justice Department prosecutors and the FBI investigators. Let's get that out in the open.

But this confrontation was unusual in its intensity, I’m told, in terms of Bondi allegedly accusing Bongino of leaking negative information about her. He denied it. And, again, it was very intense in the reporting that we have.

KARL: And he stormed out of the meeting, Bongino.

THOMAS: That's -- that’s some of the reporting we have, absolutely.

And here’s why it matters. These are two of the principal people who oversee the nation's national security in terms of terrorism, counter espionage still. The relationship and how they get along does actually matter.

KARL: It doesn't really work if the deputy FBI director, who runs the FBI day to say, is not basically not on speaking terms with the attorney general.

Let me -- let me ask you, though. There's been a lot of resources dedicated to this. I mean Bondi’s ordered this investigation. What -- give me a sense of how much they've actually spent on Epstein.

THOMAS: Well, at one point we had literally hundreds of agents who were tasked with getting together these files --

KARL: Wait a minute, wait a minute, hundreds of FBI agents?

THOMAS: Yes, that's the information that we have, that they were told, get this information to a point where some decisions could be made about what to release and not to release.

KARL: And now the answer is, they looked into it and they basically didn't find anything?

THOMAS: Well, at the end of the day, what the memo that they put out last weekend said is that he committed suicide and that there are limitations on what they're willing to release to the public and that's where it stands.

KARL: OK. I want to ask you before -- while I've got you. There was another remarkable story late this week, and that is that the FBI has been doing polygraph tests on its own workforce and that among the questions that are being asked is, have you said anything negative about FBI Director Kash Patel.

THOMAS: Well, let me be clear, there are always leak investigations and polygraphs and that sort of thing. It's been expanded from what our reporting is. And we do know that there's real concern about the so-called “deep state”.

And they've been asking questions trying to get at whether any of these people had political motivations in terms of the prosecution of former -- of, you know, then-candidate Donald Trump and now President Donald Trump.

And so, they're digging around again to make sure in their mind they want to be comfortable that they're not people still within the government --

KARL: I mean, that is pretty extraordinary though to see -- to being asked, “Have you said anything negative about the director?”

THOMAS: Well, some of the questions we’re told have to do with associations and political -- you know, for example, Pete Strzok, some of the people who --

KARL: Yeah.

THOMAS: -- are known to have said negative things. They want to know, “Have you been associated with those kind of people?”

So, it gets back to the issue of loyalty and whether they're fair or not to President Trump.

KARL: All right. Pierre Thomas, thank you very much.

I am joined now by former New Jersey governor and former U.S. Attorney, Chris Christie, and SCOTUSBLOG editor Sarah Isgur, who served as a spokesperson for the Department of Justice in the first Trump administration.

All right, Chris. Thank you for being here.

Let me get right to the president's very lengthy statement overnight defending Pam Bondi because it starts by saying, ""What's going on with my boys and in some cases gals?"" They're all going after Attorney General Pam Bondi, who's doing a fantastic job. We're on team MAGA. I don't like what's happening.”

So, are those boys and gals of team MAGA going to go along with this?

CHRIS CHRISTIE (R), FORMER NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR & ABC NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, look, what Donald Trump is learning is when you start the fire, sometimes you can't put it out. Now, he started this Epstein fire during the campaign and prior to that by alleging that this was all some, you know, Democratic plot, that he was perhaps murdered by former Democratic officeholders, that there were a lot of Democrats who had been down to Jeffrey Epstein's island and all the rest.

He used that to fire his own base, and he was going to get to the bottom of it, and he was going to release it because he's in -- absolutely in favor of transparency. Well, now you get into the job and you realize -- you know, maybe I don't want to do that.

And let's be clear about this: Pam Bondi -- there's no chance, in my opinion, that Pam Bondi made this decision on her own. No chance. She was instructed by the White House that we're not releasing this stuff. And that's why he's defending her.

And now he's at cross purposes though because when you bring in people like Kash Patel and Dan Bongino who are true believers in what Trump was saying prior to getting elected, they're saying, ""Wait a second. We came here to do the transparency thing.""

KARL: It seems to me that it wasn't so much Trump himself that was fueling the conspiracy theories. It was the people very close to him, his biggest supporters, people like Kash Patel and like Dan Bongino.

CHRISTIE: But, Jon, wait a second. We cannot let the president off that easily.

He benefited directly from it. He fueled it. He encouraged it. And he certainly didn't stop it.

So, you know, part of what bothers me in this context is that Donald Trump gets a pass. Oh, it wasn't him. It was somebody else. He took these people who were doing exactly what you just said and put them in charge of the people on the front line of protecting the American people from crime and terrorism and counterintelligence operations.

He encouraged this and by putting them in those positions, he supported the work they were doing.

KARL: Well, let me play what Trump said Tuesday at his cabinet meeting. When he's there at the cabinet meeting, Pam Bondi is just a couple seats away from him and a reporter tries to ask Bondi about all of this, and Trump intervenes and says this.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: Are you still talking about Jeffrey Epstein? This guy's been talked about for years. You're asking -- we have Texas, we have this, we have all of the things, and are people still talking about this guy, this creep? That is unbelievable.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

KARL: Okay. So, Sarah, he said it's unbelievable and people shouldn't be talking about this. That was Tuesday.

Yet all week his people have been talking about it, people like Steve Bannon, Megyn Kelly, Charlie Kirk. These are -- these are prominent figures in his movement who have been talking relentlessly about this.

SARAH ISGUR, EDITOR AT SCOTUSBLOG & ABC NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: We've heard plenty of times with folks trying to determine whether this is where the MAGA base abandons Trump and things like that. And I think those have all been pretty -- pretty big misunderstandings of how that hard candy coating around Donald Trump works.

You know, for instance, we saw that conversation happen around the pro-life movement that Donald Trump was abandoning pro-life principles and that maybe this would break up the MAGA movement.

But that hard candy coating, the people who really go out there day-to-day to defend whatever Donald Trump says, they're not policy people. They're not pro-life. They actually aren't even that big on immigration.

They're really big on this stuff, though -- JFK, Epstein, the moon landing, chemtrails.

So, this actually does have a real potential to influence whether Donald Trump has that protection between him and his base, that -- those translators. And that's what you're seeing this week is, those translators are taking a really long time to come back to Donald Trump, longer than I think we've seen to date.

KARL: I mean, I'll tell you this, if you look at his Truth Social post, again, this very long Truth Social post, the responses -- and who knows, they could be trolls, whatever, but are almost universally negative. People saying that they're not buying it. They're not ready to move on.

When --

ISGUR: Well, Jon, you had Santa's elves telling kids that Santa doesn't exist, and they're having a really hard time with that.

KARL: So, let me -- let me then play a little bit more from Kash Patel. We heard in the open. This was Kash Patel. He went on Joe Rogan's podcast in June and was asked about all of this, and here’s what he had to say.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

KASH PATEL, FBI DIRECTOR (June 6, 2025): The problem is there's been, like, 15 years of people coming in and creating fictions about this that doesn't exist. Where is the videotape of an Epstein island, x, y and z committing these frauds? Why haven’t you given it to us? Do you really think I wouldn't give that to you if it existed? I'm working my (EXPLETIVE DELETED) off, along with the leadership at the bureau and DOJ, to give you what we're allowed to give you.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

KARL: So, again, let me ask the fundamental question, are -- is the base going to buy it? You have the president saying nothing to see here. You have Kash Patel, who had been fanning this stuff directly saying, look, I mean, I would tell you. I got nothing.

CHRISTIE: Well, look, I'll tell you, I'll answer his question.

KARL: Yes.

CHRISTIE: Yes, I don't believe you give it if the president of the United States ordered you not to, because you haven't shown any independence from the president of the United States in your entire career. So, while he's asking me to believe something, like, would -- could you possibly believe me, Kash Patel, wouldn't do it, even if the president of the United States told me not to?

Look, the president made it very clear in the video we just saw before Patel's, I'm done with this. I don't want to talk about it anymore.

Donald Trump never gives, or very rarely gives, direct orders. What he does is, he does something like that, which is sending the signal out to everybody else, enough, stop. And so, I'll answer Kash Patel's question. Yes, I don't believe you would give it to us if, in fact, the president of the United States told you not to and your direct boss, the attorney general of the United States, has ordered you not to. And that's where we are.

KARL: So, Sarah, let me ask you really what is the big question. They have released -- they released, like, 11 hours of videotape of -- of Epstein's cell. It seems pretty well established that he, in fact, killed himself. I guess there are 60 seconds that are missing that has been attributed to a glitch. Well -- so, the big question is, is this now case closed on all of those conspiracy theories?

ISGUR: This was always strange to me because it depends what you mean by conspiracy theories. In terms of whether Epstein killed himself or this list that there's just no evidence ever existed, yes, I mean I hope those hundreds of FBI agents can go now, do some national security work, real stuff.

KARL: Yes.

CHRISTIE: Right. Right.

KARL: Yes.

ISGUR: However, like, where did Epstein's money come from? Where did the money now go? I mean, I guess I do still have questions about that. I'm surprised that, again, these people who made a lot of money and careers and got their current jobs based on this conspiracy theory aren't telling us any of those answers that they could have found. At the same time, hiding behind, you know, saying, well, we're not going to release, for instance, videos of minors or grand jury material that’s sealed by the court. Like, OK, but this was your bread and butter, literally.

CHRISTIE: And you know what we're finding out, Jon? Running the government is a hell of a lot tougher than running a podcast.

KARL: That’s -- that’s actually (INAUDIBLE) --

CHRISTIE: Running the government is a hell of a lot tougher than writing a children's book.

KARL: And I guess the big question now, is Dan Bongino going to leave and resign and go back to his podcast, or is he going to stay deputy director?

CHRISTIE: He doesn’t like his job anyway. Come on.

KARL: Anyway -- well, Sarah, Chris, thank you very much.

Up next, the president announced new tariffs on America’s biggest trading partners, and he turned up the heat on the Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Could he be on his way out? We'll ask the White House Economic Adviser Kevin Hassett.

We're back in two minutes.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: I think he's done a terrible job. I think we should be --

UNKNOWN: You're going to fire him?

TRUMP: No. I think we should be three points lower interest rate. He's costing our country a lot of money. We should be number one and we're not, and that's because of Jerome Powell.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

KARL: That was President Trump this week criticizing the head of the Federal Reserve. Trump Economic Adviser Kevin Hassett joins me from the White House North Lawn.

Thank you very much, Kevin, for being here. Let me -- let me ask -- we'll get to Powell in a second, but let me ask you about the new tariffs that the president has just announced that he's going to impose on August 1st on Canada, European Union, and Mexico. Why now? What's going on?

KEVIN HASSETT, WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL DIRECTOR: Well, I think that we've got a deadline that's coming up in early August, and the thing about President Trump, if you go back and look at his history, that he became one of the most successful, if not the most successful, businessman in the 20th century because he was able to squeeze everything out of every deal that he made, and right now we've got that guy who wrote ""The Art of the Deal"" making deals for the American people, and we've got to see where the dust settles.

The bottom line is that he's seen some sketches of deals that had been negotiated with Howard Lutnick and the rest of the trade team, and the president thinks that the deals need to be better, and to basically put a line in the sand, he sent these letters out to folks. And we'll see how it works out.

KARL: I mean, for all the talk of deals, I mean, there were talks of 90 deals in 90 days and then the president actually said 200 deals at one point. And we've really only seen really two and a half deals. We've seen the U.K., we've seen Vietnam, and kind of a framework on China.

HASSETT: Right.

KARL: So let me ask you, because what we're hearing from the Europeans and from the Mexicans is they were in the middle of these negotiations as this was, as this was going on, so is this a negotiating tactic, or are these tariffs real?

HASSETT: These -- well, these tariffs are real if the president doesn't get a deal that he thinks is good enough, but, you know, conversations are ongoing, and we'll see where the dust settles. The bottom line is that President Trump has produced a huge amount of tariff revenue with the tariffs we've seen in the first half of the year. The Congressional Budget Office has said that tariff revenue over the next 10 years will help reduce the deficit and secure our entitlement programs is $3 trillion and consumers haven't seen that.

You know, Consumer Price Index inflation right now is the lowest it's been in over a decade. And so what President Trump has always said is that the foreign suppliers, the foreign governments are going to bear most of the tariffs. It's being visibly seen, and I think that that's probably affecting his negotiating position because we've got all this empirical evidence that his position has been proven correct in the data.

KARL: Well, as you know, a lot of economists say that the inflation will be coming and that there was -- there were certainly a lot of exports that were, I mean, imports that were brought in in the anticipation that tariffs would be placed.

But let me, let me ask you about one new set of tariffs that he announced on Brazil. Fifty percent new tariff on Brazil. Brazil had a $6.8 billion surplus last year. In fact, the U.S. hasn't had a trade deficit with Brazil since 2007. I mean, almost two decades. So why, why, why are we putting a punishing 50 percent tariff on Brazil?

HASSETT: Well, bottom line is the president has been very frustrated with negotiations with Brazil and also with the actions of Brazil. In the end, though, you know, we're trying to put America first. I think that a lot of people, when I'm talking to negotiators from other country is at some point they'll say, ""What did we do wrong?""

And what I'm trying to get -- the message we're all trying to get across is this is about America getting itself ready for the golden age by getting our house in order, by getting our tariff and trade policy and tax policy exactly where it needs to be for a golden age.

And normally, it's not necessarily about a specific country, but with Brazil, it is. Their actions have shocked the president at times, and he's made -- been clear about that.

KARL: But I don't -- I don't understand how you're saying it's about America because the president has made it quite clear that what he's upset about is how the Brazilian Supreme Court has handled the criminal case involving former President Bolsonaro. I mean --

HASSETT: I'm agreeing with you. What I'm saying is that what I've been saying with most countries was that it's really about us getting the tariffs in order. And I think that this tariff for Brazil is a lot higher because of the president's frustration with Bolsonaro.

KARL: But --

HASSETT: And the fact that Bolsonaro himself -- you know, anyway --

(CROSSTALK)

KARL: But can you explain to me, because I find it confusing here, what -- on what authority does the president have to impose tariffs on a country because he doesn't like what that country's judicial system is handling a specific case?

HASSETT: Well --

KARL: I mean, how -- how is that --

HASSETT: If he thinks it's a national defense emergency or if he thinks it’s a national security threat, that he has the authority under IEEPA.

KARL: So, how is it a national security threat that, you know, how Brazil is handling a criminal case against this former president?

HASSETT: Well, that's not the only thing. That's not the only thing. I mean --

KARL: So, what is it? I mean, I've asked what it is. I mean, it seems that that's what President Trump's talking about. He's talking about his anger and his frustration. He's been quite candid about it with the Bolsonaro case.

HASSETT: Right. Well, the bottom line is that what we're doing absolutely collectively across every country is we're onshoring production in the U.S. to reduce the national emergency that is -- that we have a massive trade deficit, that's putting it at risk should we need production in the U.S. because of a national security crisis. And this is part of an overall strategy to do that.

KARL: But again, as we've just established, we have a trade surplus with Brazil, not a deficit.

HASSETT: But --

KARL: And we've had a surplus with Brazil for 18 years.

HASSETT: If you look at an overall strategy, if you don't have an overall strategy for this, then there'll be trans shipping and everything else, and you won't achieve your objectives.

KARL: Okay. I'm still confused, but let me move on.

Let me ask you about the 50 percent tariff that the president has imposed on copper imports. Copper, of course, is widely used in construction, industrial manufacturing, cars, mobile phones, and the like.

This is what “The Wall Street Journal” had to say about these tariffs: “Mr. Trump is going to make U.S. firms pay 50 percent more for a vital metal while they wait five or more years for U.S. sourcing. How does making it more expensive to build aircraft, ships, and ammunition promote national security? This is national insecurity.”

What's your response to “The Wall Street Journal”?

HASSETT: Right. The bottom line is that if there is a time of war, then we need to have the metals that we need to produce American weapons, and copper is a key component in many American weapon sets. And so, as we look forward to the threats that America faces, the president decided that we have plenty of copper in the U.S., but not enough copper production. And that's why he's taken this strong step.

KARL: But are you concerned about the effect of higher copper prices before American manufacturing can get up to speed?

HASSETT: The fact is that that effect that you're just discussing is something that you mentioned that economists said were going to be coming all year, these effects, and inflation is way, way down. In fact, inflation in the U.S. is right about the same level as it is in Europe.

KARL: Okay.

HASSETT: And so, the tariffs have worked the way that we said. And so, I guess the expectation would be that the countries and the people that are dumping into the U.S. would bear most of this tariff.

KARL: Before you go, I want to ask you about Jerome Powell, the Fed chair. The administration's been highly critical of the way the Fed has handled renovations to its -- to its building, to its headquarters here in Washington.

Two-point-five-billion-dollar renovation sounds like a lot to me, I have to admit.

HASSETT: Yeah.

KARL: But let me ask you, could this be used as a predicate to fire the Fed chair?

HASSETT: I think that whether the president decides to push down that road or not is going to depend a lot on the answers that we get to the questions that Russ Vought sent to the Fed. The bottom line is that this is the most expensive project in D.C. history, $2.5 billion with a $700 billion cost overrun.

To put that in perspective, the cost overrun for this Federal Reserve project is about the same size as the second biggest building overhaul in American history, which was the FBI building. And so, the Fed has a lot to answer for.

And the bottom line is -- the bottom line is that there's a key statutory problem. In 1913, when we founded the Fed, the U.S. was under a gold standard.

So, it was never envisioned, never envisioned by the people that voted for the construction of the Fed that we currently see, that the Fed could print money and toss it around willy-nilly because they had to have the gold to do what they're doing. And they're unbounded right now.

KARL: Literally -- right, literally print the money to do the renovation.

Very quickly, yes or no answer, does the president, in your view, have the authority to fire the Fed chair?

HASSETT: That's a thing that's being looked into. But certainly, if there's cause, he does.

KARL: Okay. Thank you very much, Kevin Hassett.

HASSETT: Thanks, Jon.

KARL: Really appreciate it.

Up next, did President Trump just break up with Vladimir Putin? Martha Raddatz reports when we come back.

Up next, did President Trump just break up with Vladimir Putin? Martha Raddatz reports when we come back.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

KARL: Remarkable change in President Trump's public stance on Vladimir Putin this week. Trump saying the Russian leader is, ""Not treating human beings right. He's killing too many people."" My co-anchor, Martha Raddatz takes a look at Trump's shift and what it could mean for the battle in Ukraine.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

MARTHA RADDATZ, ABC NEWS CHIEF GLOBAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This week, with Russia's assault on Ukraine far from over, a stark and surprising shift in President Trump's tone towards Vladimir Putin, a man he has often praised.

TRUMP: We get a lot of (expletive) thrown at us by Putin, if you want to know the truth. He's very nice all the time, but it turns out to be meaningless.

RADDATZ (voice-over): Trump lashing out at the Russian president and promising new weapon shipments to Ukraine.

TRUMP: We are going to send some more weapons. We have to; they have to be able to defend themselves. They're getting hit very hard now.

RADDATZ (voice-over): A stunning reversal after the administration put weapons shipments to Ukraine on hold last week without explanation.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Did you approve of that policy?

TRUMP: We wanted to put defensive weapons because Putin is not -- he's not treating human beings right. He's killing too many people. So, we're sending some defensive weapons to Ukraine and I've approved that.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So who ordered the pause last week?

TRUMP: I don't know. Why don't you tell me?

RADDATZ (voice-over): Putin's reaction was swift, launching Russia's largest attack on Ukraine since the war began more than three years ago. More than 700 drones and a dozen missiles launched in the massive aerial assault, much of it aimed at Kyiv. Trump reportedly saying he struck a deal with NATO leaders to supply weapons to Ukraine and teasing a big announcement for Monday.

TRUMP: You'll be seeing things happen.

RADDATZ (voice-over): Trump also considering granting Ukraine's request for an additional Patriot air defense system.

TRUMP: When you talk about a system like that, highly sophisticated, tremendous amount of money, and they're doing it because they want to prevent death.

VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT: Hi, everybody.

RADDATZ (voice-over): Ukraine's President Zelenskyy telling me last month that without U.S. military support, including those Patriot missile batteries, there will be more Ukrainian losses.

RADDATZ: If you do not get more U.S. aid, more U.S. military aid in particular, can Russia win?

ZELENSKYY: More -- more chance. More quick. But you know what we will have? We will have more losses. Much more losses. Without help of the United States, they can give us -- they can provide us, for example, missiles for a better (INAUDIBLE).

RADDATZ (voice over): And President Trump now signaling he's ready to support bipartisan legislation, imposing more sanctions on countries that trade with Russia, as lawmakers push to get the bill passed.

SEN. JOHN THUNE, MAJORITY LEADER: It's leverage that we need and that, frankly, the White House needs in their negotiations are the Russians.

RADDATZ (voice over): But in an interview in Moscow in May, Putin's spokesperson telling me that more sanctions targeting Russia will not bring them to the negotiating table.

DMITRY PESKOV, KREMLIN PRESS SECRETARY: It's very hard to threaten Russia with sanctions. We are a country that is experiencing a luxury of maximum sanctions that, in the history of the world, was applied. And we're a country that used to live and to live quite well under those sanctions.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

KARL: Our thanks to Martha.

I'm joined now by “New Yorker” staff writer Susan Glasser.

Susan, you just wrote a piece in ""The New Yorker"" with the headline ""Did Trump Really Just Break Up With Putin?"" So, what's the answer?

SUSAN GLASSER, NEW YORKER STAFF WRITER: Well, the answer is, maybe. Bottom line, Donald Trump, as you know, over the last ten years, has largely been incredibly complimentary of Putin. But what he's recognized is that in more than 100 days he hasn't fulfilled his pledge to end the war in Ukraine in 24 hours. And, at a minimum, Trump has been personally embarrassed, you could argue, by how Putin has strung him along and strong him along and strung him along. So, you know, it was a striking shift in tone. What we're waiting for with this big announcement, quote/unquote, tomorrow is to see whether he follows through with a change in actual policy.

KARL: But what do you think’s coming tomorrow?

GLASSER: Well, you know, it’s interesting because Donald Trump, again, has talked tougher on Russia, but right now the big question is, would the Trump administration, would this particular Republican Congress actually send more weapons to Ukraine? And the bottom line is that the last authorization of weapons was under Joe Biden's presidency in the final days, $1.25 billion. That is going to expire later this summer.

And, right now, there is no indication at all that this White House or this Congress is prepared to have a new bill authorizing billions more in aid. And, in the end, if Ukraine does not keep getting a steady supply of aid from the United States in the west, it doesn't really matter if Donald Trump curses at Vladimir Putin.

KARL: It would have to have serious Democratic support. Although it’s interesting, both speakers Johnson and John Thune have historically been supporters of aid to Ukraine.

But -- but let me -- let me ask you this, because you know Russia so well. You were based in Russia. You -- you -- you lived in Moscow as a -- as a correspondent. Are you seeing any indications that Putin is concerned about Trump's new tone? Or, what's the reaction coming from the Russians?

GLASSER: Well, I think it's striking that again and again and again over the last few months Putin has responded to Donald Trump by escalating the war. He has had an aerial bombardment of Ukraine and its civilian population in cities that has gotten tougher and tougher, frankly. The more that Putin was offered by Donald Trump, actually a very good deal, Donald Trump, according to reporting, gave him the chance to essentially keep the territory that he has illegally gained through this war of aggression, and Putin is saying, no, I want to go for it. I want to go bigger.

And that indicates that Russia thinks that its military position is actually strengthening in this conflict. That Ukraine is struggling on a variety of fronts, including the idea that Donald Trump and the West is not really there for the long haul.

KARL: If Congress passes these sanctions, which are -- seem to me pretty tough, that -- because they're not just -- they’re not on Russia, they're on people that trade with Russia, right? If - if -- if they pass these sanctions, Trump signs them and imposes them, will it make a difference? I mean Russia has been so heavily sanctioned.

GLASSER: Yes, that’s -- I think it's a, first of all, a big, important question. Second of all, it doesn't require Trump to impose these --

KARL: It gives him the power to do that.

GLASSER: Exactly. So, it really is a positioning, a messaging thing. Trump already has enormous power to impose additional sanctions on Russia, which he has chosen he not to do so. And I think that's the significant point, is it words right now or is it going to be followed up with actions?

KARL: All right, Susan Glasser, thank you very much.

Coming up, after devastating floods hit the Texas hill country, the Trump administration seems to have shifted its stances on eliminating FEMA. We'll discuss that and more with our roundtable.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

KRISTI NOEM, HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY: FEMA has been deployed and we're cutting through the paperwork of the old FEMA, streamlining it much like your vision of how FEMA should operate.

TRUMP: We have some good people running FEMA. It's about time, right, we get some good ones. They failed us in North Carolina, but when we got in on January 20th, they fixed it up in no time.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

KARL: DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and President Trump this week touting improvements to FEMA under their watch, after previously saying they plan to disband the agency.

The roundtable is here. We'll get back in just a few minutes.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

KARL: All right. Let's bring in the roundtable.

Former DNC chair, Donna Brazile, former RNC chair and Trump White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus, Center for American Progress president and CEO, Neera Tanden, and “National Review” editor, Ramesh Ponnuru.

Thank you all for being here. Before we get to all the other stuff, just a follow-up on all the Epstein news.

Reince, we heard from Steve Bannon late yesterday saying that, that this whole controversy could cause 10 percent of MAGA to stay home and not vote in the midterms, and that could cost 40 seats for the Republicans in the House. Is this -- could this potentially hurt the president?

REINCE PRIEBUS, FORMER RNC CHAIR, FORMER TRUMP WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF & ABC NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: If the election were held tomorrow, perhaps, but certainly not in 2026. Look, there are issues here that need to be resolved. Number one, from a White House perspective, chief of staff perspective, you have a staff issue, right? I mean, you've got a deputy director taking on AG publicly; that has to get resolved very quickly.

KARL: I mean, he walked out of a meeting at the White House, stormed out with the chief of staff.

PRIEBUS: So how do you resolve these things? You come up with a solution, and you -- and I would predict that you're going to see probably this week, something laid out as far as how we're going to deal with this issue, whether it's going to be a -- is there going to be a commission? Is there going to be a press conference? Is there going to be something moving forward?

KARL: But I thought the president said no more on this. We've talked about it too much.

PRIEBUS: Well, I think this is going to be -- this is going to have to get resolved both on the staff side and the solution side. And I would suspect that you're going to see something very soon.

KARL: Donna?

PRIEBUS: It's not sustainable.

KARL: Donna?

DONNA BRAZILE, FORMER DNC CHAIR & ABC NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, first of all, conspiracy theories, by nature, they're dangerous.

KARL: Yeah.

BRAZILE: It undermines trust. And it's very difficult to put the genie back in whatever bottle once it's out. This has been a comical relief, not the case itself, but the way in which they've handled it from the DOJ perspective to the White House, storming out of the meeting, all of the public threats, and now a big conference where this is the central theme, not that big beautiful betrayal. The central theme is why is this file being trashed? We need more information. It's all about the conspiracy.

RAMESH PONNURU, NATIONAL REVIEW EDITOR & ABC NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: President Trump loves conspiracy theories. President Trump has indulged one after another after another. You could argue that (inaudible).

(CROSSTALK)

PRIEBUS: QAnon -- President QAnon.

PONNURU: The birther conspiracy about President Obama was one of the ways he originally won the Republican nomination and, just as a tactic, saying you could look at all of these other conspiracies, but don't look at this one right here.

KARL: Yeah.

PONNURU: That is a very bad tactic for putting this to bed.

NEERA TANDEN, CENTER FOR AMERICAN PROGRESS PRESIDENT & CEO: Also, I mean, the Attorney General Pam Bondi went to the public and said all kinds of things about this. She said there was a list, there was files, they had people. That was in front of the White House, in front of the West Wing, that they had the influencers out there. So, I mean, there's a very legitimate question here.

Number one, was she lying then? Or is she lying now? She's the Attorney General. I do think she should go in front of Congress and sort of just explain the facts here, because ultimately, it is a big question. Was she just prancing around making things up? You're not really supposed to do that as the Attorney General. And then second of all, I'll just say, the -- everyone's acting like they don't know what the conspiracy theory is.

The conspiracy theory is that the client list has Donald Trump on it, and that's why his government is holding it back. And I think he should just -- we need to have people honestly answer questions in front of Congress or the press to just have this out once and for all.

PRIEBUS: And the overall problem with this case and why it's hard to just move on, that it's just a conspiracy. Listen, there are victims here and there are perpetrators who haven't been charged.

BRAZILE: Yeah.

PRIEBUS: And the public looks at that and says, OK, I get it. You guys are fighting over the one minute and this and that, but overall, we have a very bad thing that happened and there are people that got away with it, and that doesn't sit well with the public.

KARL: So let -- let me ask you about -- I mean, let me show you what Elon Musk, I don't know if you've been watching his X feed during all of this.

(LAUGH)

KARL: Elon Musk has been on this Epstein thing over and over again. Here's what he said. One of his many tweets. How can people be expected to have faith in Trump if he won't release the Epstein files? So my question is not that, Ramesh. My question is about Elon Musk and a third party, because Elon Musk has been saying time for a new party. He's going to theoretically fund one. How real is this threat?

PONNURU: Well, he certainly has the money to put behind any political initiative that he wants to undertake. But, we have historically not had a lot of success with third parties. The reasons we haven't had much success with third parties are still in place. And you also have to wonder whether he's the right guy to be behind it. He's an unpopular man and the platform he apparent -- presumably wants to promote, it not particularly popular either. You know, sure, a lot of people are very concerned about the Epstein issue. A lot of people are very concerned about entitlement spending. The intersection of those two groups, I don't know if that's a large constituency.

(LAUGH)

KARL: But Donna, you've seen, I think, in your past experience in politics that a third party --

BRAZILE: Third party.

KARL: -- doesn't need to be very big to have an impact.

BRAZILE: Look, I believe everyone should have a choice. They should have an opportunity to vote, you know, however they please, but the fact that Elon Musk, his brand is as tarnished. Well, I should say it this way. He's as popular as a root canal. How can he build a political party with a tarnished brand?

KARL: But -- but, Reince, Trump is really upset about this. I mean, he's been, you know, that the feud with Elon is what it is, but it seems particularly this idea that he would start a third party.

PRIEBUS: Well, because, granted, third parties -- I mean, the stacks -- the deck is stacked against them, right?

KARL: Right.

PRIEBUS: I mean, ballot X, winner-take-all electoral college, state legislatures, OK, but if someone is willing to spend a couple hundred million dollars, maybe more because Musk's ego is at it, you know, Jill Stein, Ross Perot, Ralph Nader, a few points here and there can make a difference. Forty seats? No. But, can it make the difference between winning and losing the majority in the U.S. House and having the Democrats taking over oversight? Could be.

BRAZILE: Yes.

TANDEN: Yes, I -- I would agree with that. I don't think the danger of the third party is him winning and becoming president, the danger of the third party is that he would split Republican votes. I mean, this is the person --

KARL: And, and he's born in South Africa so he's not going to be president so --

TANDEN: He is not going to be president of the United States.

PRIEBUS: Right.

TANDEN: But he spent hundreds of millions of dollars to help elect Donald Trump.

KARL: He's actually born in Africa.

(LAUGHTER)

KARL: We know that.

PRIEBUS: (INAUDIBLE).

TANDEN: So, so, but I mean, that's the dangers that it's -- look, I agree with you. It's like it splits up a lot of people. Maybe puts the Senate in play.

PONNURU: Republican voters who are dissatisfied with the Republican Party hate the Democratic Party more that they're dissatisfied with the Republican Party. They're not going to defect. If they were going to defect in that kind of magnitude, that would have happened in the 2016 election.

PRIEBUS: Understood but if --

TANDEN: But maybe it gives them an option. Maybe it gives them an option to go somewhere else.

PRIEBUS: If you put $5 million in a congressional seat that's in play and somebody, you know, someone people know, a local bank, a local car dealer, it can -- it can make a difference.

PONNURU: The congressional seats that are in play are going to have plenty of money spent on both sides.

KARL: Let me --

PONNURU: It's not going to be decided.

PRIEBUS: I think you're mostly right, but I'm just saying in the small spaces it can hurt.

KARL: It can hurt. It can hurt in there.

TANDEN: It can hurt.

PRIEBUS: That's right.

KARL: So, so -- but let me ask, can we switch topics to -- the horrific scene in Texas? And we saw at the top of this that now they're talking about improving FEMA and not eliminating FEMA, it's a bit of a change in tone. But I want to play something when Trump went to Texas and he was asked a question about the warnings, could there have been better warnings. Take a listen.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

UNKNOWN: The several families we heard from are obviously upset because they say that those warnings, those alerts did go out -- out in time and they also say that people could have been saved. What do you say to those families?

TRUMP: Well, I think everyone did an incredible job under the circumstances. Only a bad person would ask a question like that, to be honest with you. I don't know who you are but only a very evil person would ask a question like that. I think this has been heroism. This has been incredible.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

KARL: So it was evil to ask about families who were upset about lack of warnings. Also, Donna, we've had this report in ""The New York Times"" that FEMA didn't answer thousands of calls from flood survivors, essentially because a contract had been taken down by Department of Health -- Homeland Security.

BRAZILE: We need a strong FEMA. If -- if there's one thing in life I know a lot about --

KARL: Katrina.

BRAZILE: It's the aftermath. I mean, first of all, they didn't get the proper warning.

KARL: Yes.

BRAZILE: That's -- that's problem number one. But after an event, you need federal resources on the ground. States cannot handle this by themselves. With Katrina, we had over 5,000 FEMA employees. We had the National Guard. We had the U.S. military. And the fact that many of those resources are not available to the states, I mean, you just make the problem even worse.

I have to say something. Look, I understand the president wants to praise everybody when he gets up to speak, when you weaken FEMA --

KARL: Heck of a job.

BRAZILE: I mean, heck of a job, Brownie. You weaken FEMA. But with over 2,000 employees cut, 16 senior executives who know how to handle this kind of strategy, catastrophic losses, it's terrible that FEMA is not there to respond and to help the people in need.

KARL: And the acting FEMA director just got on the ground.

TANDEN: Yes, I mean, I think there are several errors here. One, as you said, they've been weakening FEMA all along. Two, they weren't pre-positioning people. People knew about this, Chip Roy knew that it was an issue we came back. But FEMA wasn't pre-positioned. And then, third, it's just, just to say this, they cut the contracts as this was happening. So call centers were down. And, you know, with all due respect to the president, last year, in North Carolina, he went on a vicious attack when there was no evidence FEMA didn't do everything it could do, almost zero evidence. Here, he's basically like everything is fantastic when there are still people hurting and these aren't like --

BRAZILE: And missing.

TANDEN: -- Republicans or Democrats. It's a --

BRAZILE: People are still missing.

TANDEN: People are still missing. Exactly.

PRIEBUS: There's plenty of time. As Donna said, there's plenty of time for us to go through this and find all the nexuses between what wasn't done right and what could be done better.

KARL: But I'm talking about the future and FEMA because they had talked about eliminating FEMA.

TANDEN: Yes.

(CROSSTALK)

KARL: Kristi Noem has said, and the state should be empowered to do this stuff on their own.

PRIEBUS: But, one doesn't beget the other. I mean, perhaps there is a better way to structure FEMA. It doesn't mean -- there can't be just one way for us to deliver emergency relief to people that are suffering. And so, I don't think it's off limits to analyze it. But in the meantime, we've got a lot of families that are grieving and arguing over whether phone calls were received or not.

And yes, we should -- maybe there should be a warning system. There's I think a lot in play here, but I don't think now is the time to start analyzing why and what -- that it's someone's person that's being blamed in FEMA.

(CROSSTALK)

KARL: A phone call.

TANDEN: Why is -- why is --

(CROSSTALK)

PONNURU: What is happening in New Mexico.

TANDEN: It's the families --

PONNURU: It's happened in Oklahoma.

PRIEBUS: No.

TANDEN: No, no, no, no. I'm sorry.

PRIEBUS: You guys are politicizing this, and I think it is ridiculous.

(CROSSTALK)

PONNURU: (Inaudible).

TANDEN: I'm sorry. This is an issue that's live right now. Families can't get through in the call centers. Like they weren't able to get through.

KARL: Two-thirds of the calls.

TANDEN: That is happening in real time right now. So, I think using the excuse that it's too close means that we'll just won't do enough --

PRIEBUS: No, no, no.

TANDEN: -- to help the families right now.

PRIEBUS: There are state resources. There's governors. There are federal resources. There is a lot of people here that are helping. There are people down there by the thousands delivering relief.

KARL: I mean, there are people --

(CROSSTALK)

PRIEBUS: And there are people who are grieving.

KARL: Ramesh?

(CROSSTALK)

PRIEBUS: And there are people who are grieving.

KARL: Look --

PONNURU: To the extent that there are knee-jerk criticisms that assume the conclusions, right, that haven't gone through and looked at all the evidence, that deserves being called out. But the president is trying to shut down the whole conversation.

TANDEN: Exactly.

PONNURU: He's saying let's not even ask the questions. It's evil to ask these questions. And I heard that question being asked during that press conference, and it was not a got you question. It was not a question trying to go after the president. It was a completely reasonable question that we have to be able to ask.

PRIEBUS: At the right time. Not where families are waiting for their children.

(CROSSTALK)

PONNURU: A press conference is the right time.

(CROSSTALK)

TANDEN: I'm sorry, why was it -- was it the right time during North Carolina for the president to (inaudible) everything?

PRIEBUS: People are looking for their dead children. I'm not talking about North Carolina.

KARL: All right, we've got to take a break. Well, thank you very much. We'll be right back.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

KARL: That's all for us today. Thank you for sharing part of your Sunday with us. Be sure to watch the ""Wimbledon Men's Final"" today on ESPN. Have a great day.

In Lengthy Press Conference, Trump Weighs In On Special Counsel Probe, January 6 Pardons, Ukraine and Gaza, Renaming Gulf of Mexico. Aired 12:30-1p ET

Aired January 07, 2025 - 12:30   ET

THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES:  -- and 5 cents on the dollar. [12:30:03]And you know, what they were doing? They were calling us up and saying, we'll sell it back to you at 200 cents. In other words, double what we paid for it. So they were going to buy it from this guy for 5 cents on the dollar. They were making deals. And fortunately, we had a very smart judge that stopped it cold. I think he called for an investigation too, and he should. But think of it, they were selling the wall. That was exactly the wall that the Border Patrol wanted, that was designed by them -- steel, concrete, rebar, exactly as they want. Very, very heavy steel, very powerful steel, hard to cut, very, very heavy 7,000 pound concrete, which is a very strong concrete. Everything was top of the line, very expensive. Would be double what we paid for it then six years ago. But let me just tell you, they were selling it for 5 cents on the dollar to people. And those people were calling us, asking us to pay them 200 cents because it's a good deal, because we can have it immediately. And you know what immediately is? Just leave it in place. No, no, the -- the papers have been written that though. You know, that deal is like all the other things that these people are doing, these people either hate our country or they're very stupid. And I don't believe they're stupid because nobody can cheat on elections like they cheat and be stupid. They either hate our country or they're stupid. So remember what I said because nobody wants to report it. They were selling the wall for 5 cents on the dollar and trying to resell it back to us for 200 cents or less, but for 200 cents on the dollar. That's a -- that's a nice return. (CROSSTALK)REPORTER:  -- announced it will be stopping fact checks on posts on its website and --  TRUMP:  Say it? Say it?REPORTER:  Meta said today it would stop putting fact checks on its website and instead allow community -- TRUMP:  Well, I watched their news conference and I thought it was a very good news conference. I think they've -- honestly I think they've come a long way -- Meta, Facebook. I think they've come a long way. I watched it, the man was very impressive. I watched it, actually, I watched it on Fox. I'm not allowed to say that. Say it? REPORTER:  Do you think he's directly responding to the threats that you have made to him in the past with these actions? TRUMP:  Yeah, probably. (CROSSTALK)REPORTER:  The last time you were -- the last time you were here, you were asked a question about the U.S. possibly launching a preemptive strike on Iran. You said you wouldn't answer that question. TRUMP:  On who?REPORTER:  Obviously -- on Iran, the U.S. launch a preemptive strike on Iran's nuclear facilities. TRUMP:  And I said, I don't -- I don't talk about it. It's a military strategy.REPORTER:  But it is a legitimate question. It's something --  REPORTER:  Well, it's not really because only a stupid person would answer it. TRUMP:  Look, it's a military strategy, and I'm not answering your questions on military strategy. All right, one more. Brian, go ahead. Brian?REPORTER:  Would you -- could you give us a preview of what you might be talking to leaders of Congress who expected to come here in the next couple of days, and you've got a very supportive Congress behind you?TRUMP:  Yeah, they're great. So we have a wonderful Republican Congress. We have a leader that have a lot of confidence in. I think he's going to be hopefully a great leader, a great speaker. And we have a leader, by the way, in the Senate, I think has been great. John Thune has been doing a fantastic job.But it goes through the House first. And the question is whether or not we do the two bills, the one bill. And, you know, look, I can live either way. I like the idea of the one big bill, but I can live either way. But they'll be coming down. The senators also will be coming down. And then ultimately we'll be meeting in the White House in a few weeks. But right now, this is the winter season. You know, they sort of call this the winter White House. It was built. I don't know if you know this, Marjorie Merriweather Post and E.F. Hutton built this. It was the greatest of all the estates in our country. And I saved it. And I got a lot of credit for saving it. Most of these big, great houses have been knocked down in Palm Beach. Just about all of them, actually. And they, you know, you build ten mansions on one site, but we saved it. But this was built as the southern White House, and she gave it to the government. And by the way, Jimmy Carter gave it back. He said it's too expensive for the United States. So I didn't -- I didn't realize that.REPORTER:  I was just -- I was just told --  TRUMP:  Actually, Jimmy Carter -- Nixon was through Watergate. He came down. He -- Nixon came here once and he thought it was incredible. But he had a thing called Watergate if anybody remembers that. And so he had other things on his mind, to put it mildly. And Jimmy Carter felt that it was too extravagant for the country. So fortunately for me, he gave it back to the foundation, and I bought it from the foundation. (CROSSTALK)REPORTER:  On reconciliation, some Republicans saying in trade for a massive bill that you and they share the interest in, they want to see big spending cuts. Do you agree with that? And what -- TRUMP:  Well, I'm okay with spending cuts. I like spending cuts. Just -- I'm on the record for spending cuts. And the debt ceiling was given to us. It shouldn't have been, but it was put in our lap. And what I want in terms of debt ceiling isn't the ceiling. [12:35:03]I just don't want to see a default. That's all I want. I never talked about spending more money necessarily, than all I want to see is no default, because nobody knows what would happen if there was a default. It could be 1929 and it could be nothing. But that was put into default, because nobody knows what would happen default, because nobody knows what would happen if there was a default. It could be 1929 and it could be nothing. But that was put into our lap and it shouldn't have been, but it was. And so we'll handle it. But debt ceiling is not about raising a lot of money. It's really just about extending it. I just want to see an extension. (CROSSTALK)REPORTER:  Mr. President, on immigration, sir, on immigration.How much can you do by executive order? Are you planning to do on executive order when it comes to immigration? And how much do you want Congress to tackle this issue? And also on day one --  (CROSSTALK)TRUMP:  Well, I had the safest border in the history of our country by far. You remember the famous chart that I brought down. I love that chart very much for a lot of reasons, but I have the safest border by far in the history of our country, and when I took it over, it was a mess. Nothing like it is now. This is ten times worse. When I got elected because of the border the first time, and I think I got elected largely because of the border the third time, and the second time I did equally well. Well, not as well as the last time, but I did very well. And I will say this was too big to rig, you know, you know the expression? Too big to rig. They couldn't do it. They tried, but they couldn't do it. I didn't get very much from Congress at all. I just said that we're being invaded, and I took the money out of the military. Much of the wall I built 500 -- over 500 miles of wall. Much of that wall was built through money that had put into the military. We took it out because we couldn't get things from Congress in those days, and we took it out, and that wall was built largely with money coming from the military. So, very simple. I went to the military -- I said, our country is being invaded by very similar. Nothing like what's invading our country now. They weren't releasing prisoners into our country and they weren't releasing mental institutions in. But some -- some bad dudes were coming in, right? And I said, our country is being invaded. And I took that money largely from the military. I was sued nine times by the Democrats in Congress, and I won all those suits and we built five -- we ended up building 571 miles of wall. Once that wall was built, they start going around it. So we're going to add another 200 that would have been up in three weeks. And then we had a very unfortunate election result. And they said we don't want to put it up. We'll sell it. And they started selling it for 5 cents on the dollar. What a -- what a --  (CROSSTALK)TRUMP:  So we'll do this again. I just want to thank everybody very much. I'm just telling you, this will be the golden age of America. This is the golden age of America. We're going to have a great country again. We're a country right now under siege. We have so many different problems and nobody respects us overseas. But now they do. The Italian prime minister, as you know, came here the other night, just flew in and flew out. She wanted to -- she wanted to see me and great respect is being shown. When I went to the cathedral in France, great respect was shown by the prime minister, the president, by everybody. France was -- and by the way, I have to say they did a great job in the cathedral. But great respect is being shown to our country again, and we have a great country, but we have to run it properly. It's going to be run properly. We want to get back those hostages for Israel and for us. You know, we do have people that are hostages being held. And I'll just say it again, if this deal is not done with the people representing our nation, by the time I get to office, all hell is going to break out. Thank you very much. Thank you. (CROSSTALK)REPORTER:  -- Ukraine, Russia, war before you take office?REPORTER:  Can you clarify what you mean by military? DANA BASH, CNN HOST:  Welcome to INSIDE POLITICS. That was over an hour of Donald Trump giving a news conference, answering questions and giving us some new information about what he intends to do, or at the very least, is not ruling out when he takes office, including not ruling out a military invasion to conquer Greenland, the Panama Canal and perhaps the annexation of the country of Canada. There is a lot more to discuss. We have a terrific panel here. Kaitlan Collins, you are our chief White House correspondent, in addition to all of your other titles. (LAUGHTER)BASH:  What's that? KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Thirteen more days to go. BASH:  Yeah. Okay, okay. But you obviously have been covering Donald Trump for a very long time. Before I get to you, I do want to play David Sanger, our friend at ""The New York Times"". His question about the Panama Canal and on Greenland and Donald Trump's response before you respond. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  No, I can't assure you on either of those two. But I can say this: we need them for economic security. [12:40:05]The Panama Canal was built for our military. REPORTER:  (INAUDIBLE)TRUMP:  I'm not going to commit to that now. It might -- it might be that you'll have to do something. Look, the Panama Canal is vital to our country. It's being operated by China. China. And we gave the Panama Canal to Panama. We didn't give it to China. And they've abused it. They've abused that gift. It should have never been made, by the way, it was -- giving the Panama Canal is why Jimmy Carter lost the election, in my opinion, more so maybe than the hostages. The hostages were a big deal. (END VIDEO CLIP)BASH:  Okay. So the question is, Kaitlan, how much of this is Donald Trump being trying to negotiate and posturing and warning them? And how much do you really think he means it, particularly given the fact that a big part of his consistent campaign message for eight years has been, I'm going to get us out of wars. COLLINS:  Well, I mean, it was an extraordinary moment, one of the most extraordinary moments of that press conference where he was refusing to rule out using military force to retake the Panama Canal, something that he himself brought up. I should note in this press conference, when a reporter later asked, why are you bringing this up? Obviously, it's a signature achievement of Jimmy Carter. He's about to be lying in state here in Washington, Trump said he was asked about it, but Trump brought it up in his opening remarks. It's something that he's been quite fixated on behind the scenes, from what I've heard from -- from sources in the past few weeks on this issue, complaining about Chinese influence. Obviously, this was a signature achievement of Jimmy Carter's. He believed it improved relations with Latin America for the United States, and still, it's one of his biggest accomplishments that people talk about. But Trump there saying that he would not rule out using military force to retake it, is not something that should be treated as with bluster. I mean, Trump is coming into this White House and is intentionally staffing his administration with aides who will not block what he wants to do or what he ultimately seeks. There were many instances in his first term where he wanted to do something, but advisers either convinced him not to or Republican lawmakers did. That is not going to be the same Washington that we are encountering in 13 days from now when Trump takes office. So I would treat everything he said there quite seriously. I mean, moments after he said he wanted to rename the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America, Marjorie Taylor Greene is saying that she's going to advocate for that. But I do want to say one of the biggest things that stood out to me from that press conference, from moments when Trump got out there before he even started taking questions, is the level of anger. BASH:  He's really agitated. COLLINS:  Well, we know why. He made it quite clear a few moments, and its two things. It's his legal issues overall, but it's -- it's the sentencing that he is facing on Friday that so far is still Judge Merchan has denied efforts to delay it. His attorneys are still working to do so. And two, it's this report by Jack Smith that we are told is imminent and is going to come out. Trump was informed during that that Judge Cannon down in Florida has tried to temporarily block that. Well, it's not a settled matter. We'll see if it's successful. But his level of anger over that is unmistakable. He has not been this angry since he won the election. BASH:  And, John, I wanted to intentionally start a little bit micro on Panama and on -- and on Greenland, particularly since his son is in Greenland as we speak. But I do want to sort of open it up a little and talk big picture about your takeaway from, as Kaitlan just said.JOHN KING, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  It is remarkable. Somebody who is two weeks from resuming the presidency of the United States, who whether you voted for him or not, whether you like him or not, just engineered a remarkable historical political comeback, is so whiny and so full of grievances. Now, that is Donald Trump's trademark. That has been his trademark since he came down that escalator. He uses grievance to keep his people together, to keep his base together, and to keep his team loyal. But he came out clearly -- his lawyers had access to the Jack Smith report at a private meeting here in Washington, D.C. They have briefed him on it. He is going to now try to use every legal power he can to prevent its release. You could see how angry he was about it. There's the sentencing on Friday. He was beating up on Joe Biden, who, yes, is using his powers on the way out to sign executive orders to do things that Donald Trump fundamentally disagrees with. COLLINS:  Trump also did. KING:  Welcome to it -- as Trump also did. Welcome to American politics. But talking about how he's inheriting a mess, he's inheriting the strongest economy in the world. It has troubles. It has potholes, it has issues. But he's inheriting the strongest economy in the world. And the Biden team is working with him as Donald Trump's own negotiator acknowledged on the very difficult issues about in the Middle East, about hostage releasing and about trying to finally bring about a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. His negotiator was very polite and respectful of the Biden administration. Trump was quite scornful and not factual. DAVID CHALIAN, CNN WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF:  Can I just say I thought that was like a bookend to the interview Susie Wiles did, who was also very respectful when she talked to ""Axios"" about Jeff Zients, the current White House chief of staff. So you have Steve Witkoff on one end talking about working so well with the Biden team in tandem on an issue as fraught as trying to get these hostages out. You had Susie Wiles on the front end two days ago yesterday saying that the chief of staff, the current Biden chief of staff, is doing everything very kind. [12:45:03]And yet in the middle of all that, you have Donald Trump trying to gin up this notion to your point about grievance, saying that they're throwing everything at this to make this a very difficult transition. KING:  Everybody's still out to get him. He just won an election. And then he questioned the election again, too. It was too big to rig, he said. He won the election. He won the popular vote. He should be celebrating. He should be coming into Washington. Yes. He has very narrow majorities in the House and the Senate. It's going to be difficult to get things done, but this should be someone who is upbeat and happy to come in. But he is still full of grievances because it is his organizing principle. But there are a lot of lies in there. That was a trailer -- that was an hour long trailer for the next four years, in that he tells a lot of lies. He hedges, he exaggerates and hypes a lot of things, but he also made a ton of news there. You're right. You're right about the idea that it's posturing, but the idea that he couldn't rule out econ -- using either economic leverage or military force to take Greenland and the Panama Canal, he says he's going to rename the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America. Canada, our closest friend in the world, our neighbor to the north, a giant economic partner, is in the middle of a political crisis right now. And he just poured kerosene on the fire. BASH:  That's why he did it. CHALIAN:  Military action there. (CROSSTALK)BASH:  Well, he did.CHALIAN:  He did actually -- KING:  He said he would, but he said he would use economic leverage. BASH:  He did. He said, I will use economic force because Canada and -- well, actually, let's listen to what --  KING:  Your neighbor's house is on fire and you don't call the fire department and you pour kerosene on it. BASH:  Let's listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REPORTER:  Are you also considering military force to annex and acquire? TRUMP:  No economic force, because Canada and the United States, that would really be something. You get rid of that artificially drawn line, and you take a look at what that looks like. And it would also be much better for national security. Why are we supporting a country $200 billion plus a year? Our military is at their disposal. All of these other things, they should be a state. That's why I told Trudeau when he came down, I said, what would happen if we didn't do it? He said Canada would dissolve. (END VIDEO CLIP)BASH:  Now, if anybody has moved since Trump was elected to Canada, they're going to be looking down from the north to the south saying, okay, is this going to happen? But no, but in all seriousness, John, you said that he's pouring gasoline on a fire. Excuse me, while Canada is having trouble. But the reality is that part of why Canada is having trouble, why Trudeau resigned yesterday is because of these threats. It's also because there's anti-incumbent fever globally and has been all year. The fact that they are in such turmoil, he believes -- Trump believes that he has maximum leverage right now with Canada.CHALIAN:  Precisely. Yeah. And you hear this -- he keeps talking about this $200 billion trade deficit, which he sees as a giveaway to Canada. And there's no doubt he sees this. In fact, he was asked about the election, if he might be able to work better. And he said, well, that guy, the conservative, may not even win. Or, you know, he didn't want to get in there because he did want to use this moment for maximum leverage. I will say just two other things that I think it's worth noting in the press conference. One, he continued, just because were a day after January 6th, to say that pardons are coming, as he has said --  BASH:  And he said, I'm making major parties.CHALIAN:  Making major pardons as it relates to January 6th, though not a clear blanket pardon for everyone involved. But clearly that is still on very much front of mind for him. And I do think you -- you heard in the press conference him at times he was asked about prices and his comments to ""Time Magazine"" about sort of expectations, setting that getting prices down is tough. He understands, you see there that he won this election on the economy and on immigration. He -- he said that as much. And so it was interesting to hear him reassert what he said at the time, which is like, oh, prices are going to come down, but it is tough to get prices down. He -- he wants to have that both ways. BASH:  I don't want to lose sight. We're going to -- Daniel Dale is getting ready to do a fact check on what he said about January 6th. And, who was killed and what the sort of what actually happened that day. But before we get to that, before this press conference and what we heard about Panama and the Panama Canal and Greenland and Canada and a whole host of other things, by far the biggest news story was Mark Zuckerberg saying this morning that they are totally changing their rules. They're getting rid of third party fact checkers, effectively saying exactly what -- what X is doing, what Elon Musk is doing and what Donald Trump and MAGA world have been asking for, for a very long time.Our Steve Contorno asked whether or not he believes that these changes, capitulations are a direct response to Trump's threat, and Trump just said one word: probably. COLLINS:  Well, I mean, the value to listening to Trump and to airing these press conferences is that he often says what he really thinks.[12:50:02]And he just had dinner with Mark Zuckerberg -- BASH:  Exactly. COLLINS:  -- at Mar-a-Lago not that long ago, not far from where he was standing. And that is how the Trump team views this big announcement. There's a reason it was announced on Fox News today. Trump was watching it as it came out and had an idea that this was coming. And so, certainly, I mean, we're seeing a lot of big tech companies and big tech founders making the trip down to Mar-a-Lago. Now, Facebook and Meta are part of that. And so we're seeing all of that part of this. That is also what I'm saying about how we should be taking what Trump is saying seriously, in the sense of he is coming into an area where big tech and big business are trying to appease him and listening to him, and certainly trying to make sure that Elon Musk isn't the only person who has major contracts that he's able to secure with the federal government. But what he's saying about Greenland there and saying not ruling out military force to David Sanger is notable. But then he said that he believes the U.S. needs Greenland for national security reasons. This has been something he has been thinking for eight years. It was brought up by ""The Wall Street Journal"" when they first reported it during his first term. But he also threatened economic coercion against Denmark, saying that he could level tariffs against them if they do not refuse to -- to provide it or sell it to the United States. That is certainly going to be an avenue. I mean, Trump's national security aides, secretary of state, incoming, potentially, Marco Rubio, the national security advisor, Michael Waltz, those are all comments that Trump is going to be committing to and keeping up with when he takes office. BASH:  Go ahead.KING:  And one other quick one we haven't mentioned because there was so much there is there's going to be a lot of reverberations throughout NATO and Ukraine. BASH:  Yeah, that was the other thing I was just going to point out -- KING:  Because he took Vladimir Putin's side about Ukraine and NATO, saying, I understand why Russia would be mad that some country on its doorstep would join NATO. And he said he was frustrated. He thought it was inappropriate that he talked to Putin before he's actually inaugurated. BASH:  Can we just stop right there, John?KING:  Yeah.BASH: Just that quote alone. KING:  Yeah, Russia is mad. And I understand that.BASH:  That Russia invaded a democracy --  KING:  A democratic nation within Europe. BASH:  -- and he understands why Russia. KING:  He understands why Russia -- well, he understands why Russia is mad. Let's be careful and let's be fair to President Trump. BASH:  That's fair. KING:  President-elect Trump. He says Russia is mad that NATO -- would be considered for NATO membership because it's on his doorstep. Ukraine is a democracy within Europe, and there's a process to apply to NATO. There has been for quite some time.The fact that the president of the United States, the leading superpower in the NATO alliance, would say, I understand that. BASH:  And he also said --  CHALIAN:  He also suggested there was some deal. He thought that was in place, that Ukraine would not -- is suggesting that Ukraine would not look for NATO membership, and said his understanding was that it was written in stone for Russia, that Ukraine would not seek entrance into NATO. COLLINS:  They also said Russia wasn't in Ukraine when he was in office. Obviously, they had illegally annexed Crimea when Obama was in office. They were fighting in Ukraine. CHALIAN:  Yes, indeed. KING:  And he said -- you know, again, we have one president at a time, which can be those lines get blurred a lot. But he did say he thought it was unfortunate he couldn't speak to Putin now, but he did say that he would speak with him as soon as possible. He gave --  BASH:  I think the question was meet with him.  KING:  Somebody said, would it take six months? Meet with him, meet with him.Now, Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor, has met with Putin. He was the first one because German. I don't want to get into German politics right now. They're complicated as well. The global politics are complicated. He finally did -- no other western leader since Putin invaded Ukraine, has met with him for the president-elect of the United States said, lets do this. To do this as soon as possible is big international news that's going to cause a lot of reverberations around Europe. BASH:  Okay. Daniel Dale has been waiting patiently. Daniel, we were talking about the president-elect's comments about January 6th. I know that there were a number of statements that are not accurate. Can you tell us what happened? DANIEL DALE, CNN SENIOR REPORTER:  There are. So listen to what he said about one prominent rioter and the presence of guns at the Capitol that day. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP:  Ashli Babbitt was killed. She was shot. She had never been shot. She was shot for no reason whatsoever. In fact, they say that she was trying to hold back the crowd, and the crowd was made up of a lot of different people. So we'll see. But I will tell you this, the person that was -- was killed was Ashli Babbitt. This would be the only insurrection in history where people went in as insurrectionists with not one gun. Okay?And let me tell you, the people that you're talking about have a lot of guns in their home. (END VIDEO CLIP)DALE:  This not one gun thing, Dana, has been debunked for three and a half years now, if not more. It is an out and out lie. Now, we'll never get a complete inventory of the number of guns brought by people to the Capitol that day, because most of them were permitted to leave before later being arrested. But there have been numerous cases in which people carried guns on Capitol grounds and were convicted for it. I have a list in front of me. Mark Mazza, two loaded handguns on Capitol grounds, five years in prison. Guy Reffitt, more than seven years in prison carried a handgun on Capitol grounds. Christopher Alberts had a pistol during the riot. Seven years in prison. Jerod Bargar pleaded guilty, had a pistol there. John Banuelos charged for allegedly twice firing a pistol in the air on Capitol grounds. Roger Preacher, pistol in his waistband. Mario Morris of Texas convicted of having a pistol in his waistband at the Capitol. So, the not one gun thing is out and out false. Now, on the Ashli Babbitt case -- look, it's subjective of whether she should have been shot. I can't fact check that, but the president- elect is certainly leaving out some pertinent facts here, specifically that Ms. Babbitt was a rioter who was trying to enter a shattered window of the House speaker's lobby had been warned not to do so, was carrying a knife. So, certainly, not just wandering around aimlessly or something of that sort. BASH:  All right. Daniel, thank you so much for that. Appreciate it. And staying on the sort of broader topic or the related topic to January 6th, I don't want to lose sight of what he said about Jack Smith, calling him deranged and worse, which is, I know, not new. He called him mean and nasty, but also what happened while this press conference was going on, which is that Judge Aileen Cannon, a judge who actually he said that he had never met, even though he obviously had a very important case before her, and he appointed her to the federal bench. She ruled that this report that Jack Smith put together will remain sealed. COLLINS:  And she's not the final say I should note. We'll wait to see, because obviously the Justice Department is going to respond to this, I would presume basically this report from our understanding, and we learned a lot from a filing that came out last night. Trump's attorneys and the attorneys of his allies/co-defendants in Florida reviewed this over the weekend. They got to go to the DOJ, go into a conference room and actually look at this report. The understanding is, as they laid it out in this filing, is that it's two parts. On the election interference case and the classified documents case. They were arguing, in part, that the classified documents case shouldn't come out because of the Walt Nauta and Carlos de Oliveira. They still have charges pending against them. But Trump's attorneys signed on saying none of this should be able to come out because Jack Smith's not supposed to be special counsel, which is Judge Cannon's findings as well, which is why the classified documents case is no more. Trump found out during that that she says right now, temporarily, this report cannot be released. They can't. The Jack Smith can't even transmit it to the Justice Department, is what she's arguing. We'll see if that holds. Obviously, there will be appeals. We're told it could come out really any day now, potentially by the end of this week. But they are fighting very hard. And he is very angry that even part of this could come out. What I've heard from people over the last few weeks is that a lot of this has to do with the Mueller report coming out and how Trump felt about that, because it went into details about his aides and whatnot. So we'll see if it ultimately comes out. But I mean, he came out and I think so much of what we heard was there was this underlying level of anger about this and the sentencing in New York. BASH:  But I agree with that. I believe, because he talked about the ""injustice department"", quote, unquote, many, many times. The whole beginning of this news conference was also about the series of executive orders that Joe Biden has issued relating to land -- relating to oil and gas. And that kind of prompted a lot of what he said, said yesterday on Truth Social. And again, at this press conference about the fact that he doesn't think Biden is giving him a proper transition, which Susie Wiles his incoming chief of staff, explicitly said the opposite. But I don't -- I don't want to gloss over some of the interesting things that we heard. We heard things before about windmills and so forth. But --  KING:  Don't forget about water in your dishwasher. BASH:  He went off about and we've actually heard a little bit about that before, believe it or not. But he went off about, his anger about gas stoves and gas heat in particular, and the fact that the Biden administration wants to be more electric and that he said, you know, people know that if you have electric heat in your apartment, in your house, you get the itch. CHALIAN:  I mean, he has guys this -- he's talked about these kinds of things, these environmentally tangential pieces of your everyday home life. He gets obsessed with them.BASH:  Yes.CHALIAN:  But as I listen to Kaitlan talk about the anger that was on display here, I do think it is important to note how much that is in contrast to what we've seen since the election in November from him. That is a -- this was a more familiar Trump to anyone who paid attention to the four years where he felt completely under siege all the time when he was in the White House. That's not how he felt. He -- I mean, he's given voice to this when he said, you know, everyone used to attack me, and now everyone's being a friend of mine. That's part of his sort of lighter feeling about this moment and becoming the 47th president again, different than he felt becoming the 45th president. And this was a return -- to your point about the trailer, I just wonder if America knew we were going to get sort of this kind of repeat performance. BASH:  I'm sure --  KING:  It's just a fascinating glimpse of his mindset, the artificial line separating the United States and Canada. I know that's an internationally recognized border, as is the sovereignty of Greenland, as is the treaty where Jimmy Carter signed over the Panama Canal, as is when you pull out a map. I use maps every now and then where it says the Gulf of Mexico. That's been there for a while. Donald Trump thinks if I wanted to be, it shall be. It's just a fascinating glimpse at his mindset. And, you know, in 13 days, he becomes president of United States again. And we will -- we will watch how much again, she knows better than anyone at this table. A lot of what he says is for negotiating purposes and purposes, to get some percentage of what he really says is what he wants. But here it comes. BASH:  They say you should live in interesting times. These are those times. Thank you all for getting us through that. I appreciate it. Thank you for watching INSIDE POLITICS.

Marco Rubio, Secretary of State

Washington, D.C.

March 2, 2025

QUESTION:  Mr. Secretary, thank you for joining us this morning.  Has there been any contact with President Zelenskyy since Friday?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, I haven’t had any contact with him since Friday.  We have plenty of contacts with him, though.  Plenty.  I mean, he met – in the last ten days, he’s met with the Secretary of Commerce – he spoke to the President on the phone, met with the Secretary of Commerce, met with me, met with the Vice President, met with our special envoy, and then was invited and came over on – invited.  He wanted to come over on Friday to sign this commercial deal that didn’t happen.  So there’s been plenty of contact with them.  I’ve talked to the foreign minister several times – not since then.  And we’ll see moving forward.

I think the last line in the President’s Truth Social post is the one to focus in on, and that is we’ll be ready to reengage when they’re ready to make peace, which is clearly what the President’s goal is here.  He’s trying to get Russia to the table to bring about – to see if there’s a way to bring about an end to this conflict.  That’s his goal.  That’s his only goal.  That’s his centralized focus.  And hopefully, we’ll get to a point where that’s possible.

QUESTION:  The British prime minister said this morning that the United Kingdom and France are working on a peace plan with Ukraine to present to the U.S.  Do you know where things stand with that plan?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  No.  I mean, I’ve talked to both of the foreign ministers of France and the UK yesterday, and I explained to them sort of the events leading up to what you saw on Friday.

Look, I think what’s really important here is to understand the dynamic.  The President is basically saying there’s this horrible war, it’s been going on for three years, it is a bloody stalemate, a meatgrinder type war, and he wants it to end.  How does it end?  It’s very simple.  The only way it ends is if Vladimir Putin comes to a negotiating table.  And right now, President Trump is the only person on Earth who has any chance whatsoever of bringing him to a table to see what it is he would be willing to end the war on.

Now, maybe their claims or what they want, their demands, will be unreasonable.  We don’t know, but we have to bring them to the table.   You’re not going to bring them to the table if you’re calling them names, if you’re being antagonistic.  That’s just the President’s instincts from years and years and years of putting together deals as someone who’s in business.  And that’s the only goal here is —

QUESTION:  Well, let me just stop you there for one second.  Why is it —

SECRETARY RUBIO:  — to try to bring about an end to – a freer world – a war with no end in sight.

QUESTION:  Why is it okay to call President Zelenskyy —

SECRETARY RUBIO:  All right, I’m sorry.

QUESTION:  Why is it okay to call President Zelenskyy a dictator but not, as you say, call Vladimir Putin names?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  We’ve spent three years calling Vladimir Putin names.  That’s not the point now.  The point that we’re at now is we’re trying to get the man to a table.  The Russians – and I’ve said from the very beginning maybe they don’t want a deal either.  We don’t know.  But we haven’t talked to them in three years, but maybe they do.

The point is do we want to make – I would ask everybody this:  If there are no negotiations, what is the alternative?  Another four years of war, another three years of war, in which the United States and Europe continues to pour billions of dollars into a war in Ukraine?  Is that the alternative?

I’ve asked every foreign minister I meet with, “Tell me your idea of how this turns out.”  Most don’t have a plan.  A few have said, well, let’s give them another year of fighting, a year from now, a year later, after another year of death, another year of destruction, then maybe Putin will be ready to negotiate at that point.  That doesn’t sound like a good plan to me, and it certainly is not a plan the President is on board with.

QUESTION:  It’s not just about getting people to the table.  It’s about keeping agreements that are made.  And that was one of the points that President Zelenskyy was making in the Oval Office on Friday is that Vladimir Putin has not kept the agreements that were made in the past.  Wasn’t he right about that?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  But what is – moving forward is the question, not the past.  No one here is claiming Vladimir Putin is going to get the Nobel Peace Prize this year or that he should be the man of the year of the humanitarian association.  What we’re arguing here is he has a very large country, they’re on full war footing, they’re cranking out weapons now at a war-footing pace, and we need to figure out is there a way to get them to stop the war.  And the only way you’re going to do that is to get Russians engaged in negotiations – something the Europeans haven’t been able to do, the Biden administration wasn’t able to do or didn’t even try.

That’s the goal here.  It’s that simple.  Can we try to sit with them and figure out whether there’s any – what are the Russian demands?  Under what conditions would the Russians be willing to stop this war?  And as I said, we don’t know what those are because we haven’t talked to them in three years.  That’s the singular goal here is to try to bring about an end to this conflict, and it begins by getting them to the table.

Ultimately, like any truce, like any peace agreement anywhere in the world, those things will have to be enforced.  They’ll have to be enduring.  There will have to be safeguards put in place.  Everybody understands that.  But it begins with the first step, and that is engaging them to see if it’s even possible.  Because if it’s not possible, then what we’re looking at is a protracted stalemate with thousands of people dying, billions of dollars pouring in, and more death and destruction.  And that’s not something the President wants to be a part of.  He’s made it very clear.

QUESTION:  Aren’t those talks feasible only if the United States is willing to also provide security guarantees to Ukraine?  That was the point that President Zelenskyy was also making in the Oval Office.

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, the security guarantees – which I actually like to call deterrence – is all contingent upon there being a peace.  Everybody is saying security guarantees to secure the peace.  You first have to have a peace.  We don’t even know if the peace is possible.  And that – this was understood by the Ukrainians.  It was explained to them repeatedly, and that is here’s our strategy, we’re trying to get Putin to a negotiating table.  Don’t – let’s not – everyone knows the history here, the back and forth.  We understand that.  We all understand that.

But the question now is can we get them to a table to negotiate.  That’s our goal.  Don’t do anything to disrupt that.  And that’s what Zelenskyy did, unfortunately, is he found every opportunity to try to Ukraine-splain on every issue, then he confronts the Vice President.  When the Vice President says the goal here is diplomacy, he immediately jumps in and challenges the Vice President – well, what kind of diplomacy?  So we all understand, okay, that Putin is not going to be an easy negotiator in this regard.  We all get that.  But we have to – we have to start the process to see if something is even possible.

And I honestly am puzzled.  I just don’t understand.  The Biden administration berated Benjamin Netanyahu and the Israelis, put all kinds of conditions and pressure on them to try to get a ceasefire.  In this particular case, we’ve been nice by comparison.  And all we’re trying to do here is figure out whether a peace is possible.  All these other things that people keep bringing up, that’ll have to be a part of a negotiation.  Right now there is no negotiation.  Shouldn’t we at least try to see if there is a way to end this war in a way that’s acceptable to both sides and is enduring and sustainable?  How is that a bad thing?  I really am puzzled why anyone thinks that trying to be a peacemaker is a bad thing.  It’s only a bad thing when it’s Donald Trump trying to do it, when it’s President Trump.  It’s absurd to me.

QUESTION:  Well, even some of your Republican allies are puzzled by the steps that President Trump has taken to placate Vladimir Putin.  I want to bring up a post that Lisa Murkowski —

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, which ones?  What steps has the President taken to placate —

QUESTION:  Let me show —

SECRETARY RUBIO:  What steps has he taken?

QUESTION:  Let me show you —

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Are we arming the Russians?

QUESTION:  — what Lisa Murkowski said and your —

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Are we providing economic assistance to the Russians?  Have we given the Russians $180 billion?  What does that mean, “to placate”?

QUESTION:  Let me ask you the question.  This is Lisa Murkowski and here’s what she says:  “This week started with administration officials refusing to acknowledge that Russia started the war in Ukraine.  It ends with a tense and shocking conversation in the Oval Office and whispers from the White House that they may try to end all U.S. support for Ukraine.  I know foreign policy is not for the faint of heart, but right now I am sick to my stomach as the administration appears to be walking away from our allies and embracing Putin – a threat to democracy and U.S. values around the world.”  Those are not my words.  That’s Senator Lisa Murkowski.  What’s your response?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, yeah, we’re a free country.  People have a right to these opinions.  I would just say to you, “What have we done to placate the Russians?”  The only thing we’ve done is say are you guys willing to talk about peace.  I say the same point.  We’re not giving – we haven’t given Russia $180 billion in weapons.  We haven’t given them an Oval Office meeting.

QUESTION:  You voted with North Korea and Russia and – you voted with North Korea and Russia and Belarus in the United Nations and against our Western allies.

SECRETARY RUBIO:  No, let me tell you.  All right, so you know what the – do you know what the United Nations resolution was?  I’ll tell you if you want to hear what it was.  It basically said this has been a horrible war, it’s time for it to end, the job of the UN is to bring about peace in the world.  I thought that’s what the UN was created to do – to stop wars and to prevent them.  And that’s what the resolution did.

Was it antagonistic towards the Russians?  No.  Back to the point.  But it also didn’t praise the Russians.  All it said is this is a bad war, it needs to end.  And by the way, at the Security Council, which has not been widely reported, the first resolution on Ukraine that has passed the Security Council in three years passed this week because of the leadership of President Trump, and it’s a resolution that said bad war, needs to end, let’s bring the two sides together.  That’s what the resolution is.

Again, what is the United Nations for?  Isn’t it not a forum to promote peace in the world?  And shouldn’t our president – shouldn’t we all be happy that we have a president who’s trying to stop wars and prevent them instead of start them?  And I just don’t get it, I really don’t, other than the fact that it’s Donald J. Trump.  If this was a Democrat that was doing this, everyone would be saying, well, he’s on his way to the Nobel Peace Prize.  This is absurd.  We are trying to end a war.  You cannot end a war unless both sides come to the table, starting with the Russians, and that is the point the President has made.  And we have to do whatever we can to try to bring them to the table to see if it’s even possible.

I’m not promising you it’s possible.  I’m not telling you it’s 90 percent likely.  I’m saying it’s 0 percent likely if we don’t get them to a negotiating table.  And the sooner everyone grows up around here and figures out that this is a bad war that’s heading in a bad direction with death and destruction and all kinds of danger surrounding it that could spiral into a broader conflict, the sooner people grow up and realize that, I think the more progress we’re going to be able to make.

But the President is crystal clear.  He campaigned on it and he’s going to govern on it, and that is he is going to be a president that tries to achieve peace.  And he has been very clear this is a war that would have never happened had Donald Trump been in the White House, and it needs to end, and we’re going to do everything we can to end it in an enduring and sustainable and fair way.

QUESTION:  You said in your confirmation hearings that Russia will have to make concessions to get a peace deal.  What concessions do you expect them to make?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, why would I say that on a news broadcast?  That’s what negotiations are about.  That’s the problem here.  Again, everybody is – this is not a messaging exercise, okay?  This is can they get to a table, and then there’s hard work to be done.  You’re absolutely right; I’m not telling you this is an easy peace deal.  The Russians will give you a 30-minute lecture on the history of Ukraine and this, that, and the other.  The Ukrainians have their own point of view.  There’s no doubt about it.

But what peace deal in the history of the world has ever been easy?  That’s the hard work of diplomacy.  That’s exactly what the Vice President was alluding to.  That’s what peace deals involve.  You’ve covered this.  You’ve been around for a long time.  These conflicts are not easy to solve.  We’re getting – but you can’t solve them at all if you don’t even have a process to try to solve it, if you don’t have the parties at the table.

And right now that’s been our goal.  It’s been explained crystal clear to the Ukrainians and the Europeans and everyone else who wants to know for weeks now, for weeks now.  And the only thing they were told was do not do things to derail it.  And sadly, President Zelenskyy couldn’t contain himself in that regard.  I hope this could all be reset.  I hope he comes to the realization that we’re actually trying to help his country here before it suffers thousands of more casualties.  Three million people have already left Ukraine.  Are they ever going to be able to come back?  He’s got Ukrainians being held prisoner, including children, on the Russian side.  All this is – why is any of this good for anybody?  And the argument that we’re going to just keep it going forever, that’s absurd.

So it’s time to bring the Russians to the table if it’s even possible and see if there is a way forward that ends this conflict and makes sure it never happens again.  That’s our goal.  That remains our goal.  That’s the President’s goal.

QUESTION:  Mr. Secretary, thanks for your time this morning.

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Thank you.

Interview

Marco Rubio, Secretary of State

February 28, 2025

QUESTION:  And my source tonight is the Secretary of State, who was in that room today, Marco Rubio.  Thank you so much, Secretary Rubio, for being here.  We just heard from President Zelenskyy.  He said he does not think that he owes President Trump an apology for what happened inside the Oval Office today.  Do you feel otherwise?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  I do.  I do.  Because you guys don’t see – you guys only saw the end.  You saw what happened today.  You don’t see all the things that led up to this, so let me explain.  The President’s been very clear; he campaigned on this.  He thinks this war should have never started.  He believes – and I agree – that had he been president it never would have happened.  Now here we are.  He’s trying to bring an end to this conflict.  We’ve explained very clearly what our plan is here, which is we want to get the Russians to a negotiating table.  We want to explore whether peace is possible.  They understand this.  They also understand that this agreement that was supposed to be signed today was supposed to be an agreement that binds America economically to Ukraine, which, to me, as I’ve explained and I think the President alluded to today, is a security guarantee in its own way because we’re involved; it’s now us, it’s our interests.

That was all explained.  That was all understood.  And nonetheless, for the last 10 days in every engagement we’ve had with the Ukrainians there’s been complications in getting that point across, including the public statements that President Zelenskyy has made.  But they insisted on coming to D.C.  This agreement could have been signed five days ago, but they insisted on coming to Washington and there was a very – and should have been a very clear understanding:  Don’t come here and create a scenario where you’re going to start lecturing us about how diplomacy isn’t going to work.  President Zelenskyy took it in that direction and it ended in a predictable outcome as a result.  It’s unfortunate.  That wasn’t supposed to be this way, but that’s the path he chose, and I think, frankly, sends his country backwards in regards to achieving peace, which is what President Trump wants at the end of the day – is for this war to end.  He’s been as consistent as anyone can be about what his objective is here.

QUESTION:  But what specifically do you want to see President Zelenskyy apologize for?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, apologize for turning this thing into the fiasco for him that it became.  There was no need for him to go in there and become antagonistic.  Look, this thing went off the rails.  You were there, I believe.  It went off the rails when he said:  Let me ask you a question – to the Vice President – what kind of diplomacy are you talking about?  Well, these – this is a serious thing.  I mean, thousands of people have been killed – thousands – and he talks about all these horrible things that have happened to prisoners of war and children.  All true, all bad.  This is what we’re dealing with here.  It needs to come to an end.  We are trying to bring it to an end.

The way you bring it to an end is you get Russia to the table to talk, and he understands that.  Attacking Putin, no matter how anyone may feel about him personally, forcing the President into a position where you’re trying to goad him into attacking Putin, calling him names, maximalist demands about Russia having to pay for the reconstruction – all the sorts of things that you talk about in a negotiation.  Well, when you start talking about that aggressively – and the President’s a deal maker, he’s made deals his entire life – you’re not going to get people to the table.  And so you start to perceive that maybe Zelenskyy doesn’t want a peace deal.  He says he does, but maybe he doesn’t.  And that act of open undermining of efforts to bring about peace is deeply frustrating for everyone who’s been involved in communications with them leading up to today.  And I think he should apologize —

QUESTION:  But can I ask you —

SECRETARY RUBIO:  — for wasting our time for a meeting that was going to end the way it did.

QUESTION:  You yourself have said previously that Putin cannot be trusted in negotiations.  That was the point that President Zelenskyy was ultimately making during that conversation, is that there cannot be an agreement without security guarantees, because he was talking about all the ceasefire agreements before or agreements that Putin has just blown past.  I mean, do you still feel that way, that Putin cannot be trusted in these negotiations?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, I was there yesterday when the President said in front of the media that our approach is going to be trust but verify.  Donald Trump has made – President Trump’s made deals his entire life.  He’s not going to get suckered into some deal that’s not a real deal.  We all understand this.  We understand it on our end for certain.  And so the goal here is to get to a place – we have to explore whether peace is possible.  I’ve said this repeatedly.  I don’t know; I think it is based on what they’ve said so far.  But we have to explore that.

How else is this war going to end?  I ask people:  What is the European plan to end this war?  I can tell you what one foreign minister told me, and I’m not going to say who it was but I can tell you what one of them told me, and that is that the war goes on for another year and at that point Russia will feel so weakened that they’ll beg for peace.  That’s another year of killing, another year of dying, another year of destruction, and by the way, not a very realistic plan in my point of view.

So if there’s a chance at peace, even if it’s a 1 percent chance, that needs to be explored – and that’s what President Trump is trying to do here.

QUESTION:  President Trump said just when he was leaving the White House after that meeting that he doesn’t think President Zelenskyy wants peace.  But isn’t that why the Ukrainian leader was in the Oval Office for that meeting today?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, he was in the Oval Office to sign a minerals rights deal.  That’s what he was in the Oval Office to sign today.  But again, when you have comments that deliberately – appear to be deliberately – I mean, after having discussed this repeatedly, deliberately appear to be geared towards making the argument that peace is not possible.  Again, I turn to the – he turns to the Vice President:  What kind of diplomacy are you talking about?  Almost as if to say, these people, you can’t deal with them; we can’t – you can’t have any negotiations with Putin because he can’t be trusted and you’re just wasting your time on negotiations.  Well, he’s directly, basically, undermining everything the President has told him he’s trying to do.

Look, there’s no need for that.  You start to suspect, does he really want an end to this war?  Does he just think that we have to do whatever he says and give him anything he wants without any end game?  That was the Biden strategy.  That was the Biden strategy.  We were funding a stalemate.  We were funding a meatgrinder.  And unfortunately for the Ukrainians, the Russians have more meat to grind, and they don’t care about human life.  We’ve seen it – human waves, the North Koreans, et cetera.  And so this is a very complex thing, it’s very delicate, it’s very costly, it’s very bloody.  It needs to be brought to and end.  But it isn’t going to be brought to an end with public pronouncements and maximalist demands in the public, but in real diplomacy.  The Vice President was right.

QUESTION:  When you say they don’t care about life, you – are you talking about the Russians or the Ukrainians?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, the Russians.  I mean, they’re conscripting by the hundreds of thousands.  They’ve brought in —

QUESTION:  Okay, I just —

SECRETARY RUBIO:  — North Korean troops that were slaughtered in Kursk, and they keep going because they’ve got more people.  That’s the other fact.  Look, and it’s – again, we go back to the same point.  I’m not going to fall into this trap of who’s bad and who’s evil.  People can make those conclusions.  People have seen how this narrative has played out and where we are today and how this all started and so forth.  The point now is it has to end, and the way it ends is you get people to a negotiating table.  And the President, who’s the ultimate deal maker, knows you don’t get people to a negotiating table when you’re calling them names and you’re accusing them of things.  Because at the end of the day this is not a political campaign, okay?  This is high-stakes international diplomacy and an effort to bring about an end to a very, very dangerous war.

QUESTION:  But you yourself, sir, have said before that you believe Putin is a war criminal, that that is a widely accepted fact.  You’ve called him a butcher, and you’ve said that as the Secretary of State you do believe it’s important for someone with such global influence as you have to speak with that kind of moral clarity.

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Yeah, and at this moment as Secretary of State, my job working for the President is to deliver peace, to end this conflict and end this war.  Ultimately, that is the job of the State Department.  The State Department doesn’t fight wars, it ends them.  It tries to end them.  And that’s usually, by the way, celebrated.  I mean, throughout history I’ve watched presidents that bring about an end to wars and conflicts, and people celebrate that.  They applaud it.  I think we should be very proud and happy that we have a President whose prime objective is not to get into wars but to prevent wars and to get out of wars.  That is a very noble, laudable goal.  Everyone should be applauding it, and he should be given the space to do that – not undermined by demands that he call Putin names or that we say things that impede the ability to conduct real diplomacy, as the Vice President said today.

QUESTION:  To follow up on what you just said a moment ago, are you saying that you’re – you have doubts that President Zelenskyy wants this war to come to an end?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  What I have doubts about is whether he’s willing to say and do the things that we need in order to get a negotiation.  Again, you – this has been going on for 10 days, and to see things in the press saying we’re not coordinating with the Ukrainians, that’s absolutely false.  Over the last 10 days the Ukrainians have met with the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of State, the Vice President of the United States, had a phone call with President Trump, and he was in the Oval Office today.  I’ve talked to the foreign minister of Ukraine three times in the last 10 days.  The argument that we’re not engaging – but yet you keep reading these press accounts about, oh, well, they’re leaving us out, we’re not involved, we’re not engaged.  None of these things are true and it continues.

So all that led up to today and a deep sense of frustration, and my hope is that this all can be reset and maturity can kick in and some pragmatism, because this war – tonight, people will die in Ukraine.  Tonight, people will die in this conflict.  We’re trying to bring an end to this conflict, which is unsustainable.  It’s an unsustainable, bloody war that has to come to an end.  And right now the only leader in the world that can even have a chance of bringing about an end to this is named President Donald Trump, and we need to give him the opportunity to try and do that.  And when you see efforts to impede it, when you – when you tell someone don’t say – let’s not talk about these things, let’s not go in this direction because it makes it harder for us to engage, and they insist on doing it anyways, you start to wonder.  You start to wonder.  I don’t like to impugn people’s motives, but you start to wonder what’s behind it.

So look, again, let’s hope that this —

QUESTION:  Can I ask you, Secretary Rubio —

SECRETARY RUBIO:  — can be salvaged, but I’m not sure after today.

QUESTION:  You don’t believe that this can be – you’re not sure that this can be salvaged?  I mean, can this relationship between Zelenskyy and Trump be repaired, in your view?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  I think anything is possible, but it has to go back to the point that President Trump is interested in being involved in this for the purposes of bringing about an enduring and lasting peace.  That’s what he wants to achieve.  And I think if I’m a country, okay, that’s involved in a war with a bigger country, who’s losing thousands of people, who’s had 3 million people leave my country because they can’t be there, who every – is facing these challenges, I would be thanking a president who’s trying to help bring about an end to this war.  I would be thanking him and I would be supportive of what he’s trying to do, at least in my public pronouncements and in my public posture.  And we didn’t see that today, and we haven’t seen that for the last few days.

Now, will that change?  I hope so.  It should for the purposes of global peace and stability in Europe and around the world.

QUESTION:  Vice President Vance was criticizing Zelenskyy for not saying thank you specifically during that meeting, those 40 to 50 minutes that we were in the Oval Office.  But certainly you know very well, Secretary Rubio – your time as a senator here in Washington – that whenever Zelenskyy has come to Washington before, he has very much expressed that kind of gratitude.  Just listen to this:

PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY:  Thank you for both financial packages you have already provided us.

Really, all my appreciations from my heart, from the heart of Ukrainians, all Ukrainians.

So what can I say to American people in English?  My English is poor.  To say all my messages and all my thanks to you.

And thank you very much for supporting us, our people.

(Via interpreter) Thank you, United States.  Thank you, America.

(Via interpreter) Ukraine is grateful to the United States for its overwhelming support.

QUESTION:  Do you think you can make the argument that he hasn’t said thank you?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, I think the Vice President said he hadn’t said it today, he hadn’t heard it today in that meeting.  And we were hoping that that meeting would begin by:  Thank you for everything you’ve done for us, we wouldn’t be where we are today without you, we wouldn’t even have a chance to negotiate a peace without the help you gave us.  By the way, without the help you gave us when you were president in the first term, because President Obama refused to provide them defensive capabilities in terms of military hardware.  He did provide them blankets —

QUESTION:  Yeah, and that was brought up today during that meeting.

SECRETARY RUBIO:  — he did provide them humanitarian aid, but – well, but – it was brought up, but I was there.  In fact, I vividly recall at the time Vice President Biden saying to me in a meeting that we had at the vice president’s residence that the reason why we didn’t want to provide them those weapons is because they might use them.  That was his exact quote and that was the attitude.

I remember clearly then the Ukrainian leaders saying we don’t need more blankets or MREs, we need weapons to defend ourselves.  And they didn’t do it.  President Trump did.  He provided them weaponry, some of it – much of it – which was used at the beginning of this war, and without those weapons being in their stocks, this war could have been over very quickly – two, three, four days.

Another potshot that Zelenskyy took today – when the President pointed that out, you know what Zelenskyy said?  He said, yeah, yeah, we’ve heard that from the Russians.  That’s not a Russian narrative.  That was the official position, okay, of the United States.  I vividly recall being briefed by leaders in the Biden administration telling us that this war was going to be over in five to six days.  They believed that.  That was their assessment at the time, and it wasn’t the case because of the weapons that Ukraine had in stocks because of President Trump in his first term.  So he should have been grateful for that and grateful for what we’re doing now.

And one more point:  It’s not just President Trump.  There’s – there’s news reports out there from NBC News, at least is one of the places I recall, reporting that Biden had a shouting match with Zelenskyy for not being grateful and not being thankful for everything that was provided back in 2022.  Now, that didn’t happen in front of the press.  That was leaked, but it got out there.  It’s had – these frustrations are not unique to President Trump.  There was those frustrations in the previous administration, if NBC News is to be believed.

QUESTION:  Yeah, right, but obviously we’ve never seen anything like what we saw today.  But the point that Zelenskyy was making there is that everyone predicted his demise, and Ukraine was able to fight and to survive.  Zelenskyy was able to survive; the Ukrainian people have been fighting for three years.  You yourself have said previously that the United States should assist Ukraine as long as the Ukrainians are willing to fight.  So I think the question coming out of that meeting is:  What happens next here?  I mean, you are the U.S. chief diplomat.  Is there a path for diplomacy?  Is a ceasefire still a possibility tonight?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, number one, you know who else said that Ukraine is very brave and very valiant?  President Trump.  He said it today.  He said it repeatedly – your soldiers have been very brave, your fighters have been very brave, your people have been very brave.  He said that repeatedly, and everyone recognizes that.  But we’re three years into a war that has no end in sight and no exit strategy.  The EU doesn’t have an exit strategy.  I saw the comments tonight from the leader of the EU saying that we need a new leader of the – of the free world.  I mean, these people are just playing silly games and saying these things.  What is their exit strategy?  What is anybody else’s exit strategy?  The only person on the planet who is actively trying to bring an end to this conflict is named Donald Trump, the President of the United States.  He’s the only one that’s trying to do it and we should be helping him to achieve it.

QUESTION:  Can I ask you –

SECRETARY RUBIO:  And so do I think it’s possible?  Yeah, I hope it’s possible, because that’s what we do try to do at the Department of State, is we try to bring end to conflicts, not start new ones and certainly not extend them.

(Break.)

QUESTION:  Senator Lindsey Graham, after having lunch with President Trump today, said Zelenskyy either needs to resign or they need to send someone over that we can do business with.  Do you feel that President Zelenskyy needs to resign?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, that’s Lindsey’s feeling, because he feels very passionately.  He’s been a very strong supporter of Ukraine.  Lindsey Graham has been one of the strongest voices for Ukraine.

QUESTION:  But what is the United States’s position?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, the United States – the President’s taken no position on that.  What he said today is let him come back when he’s ready to do peace.  That’s what he said.  Let him come back when he’s ready to do peace.  So I can’t speak for what anybody else said.  I can only go off the words from the President of the United States, and that is today we’re not – this is not going to be productive any further.  When Zelenskyy’s ready to make peace and he’s serious about peace, let him come back then, and that’s when we’ll re-engage with them.

And what he means by that is he understands —

QUESTION:  And how will you measure that?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, I think it’s everything I’ve said already, and that is:  How are you going to get Vladimir Putin and the Russian Federation to a table to discuss even the opportunity, whether there – even to explore whether there’s an opportunity for peace?  You’re not going to do it by calling him names.  It makes everybody feel very good.  You can pass resolutions, you can put out very strongly worded statements.  Senators can do it.  I did when I was in the Senate.  House members can do it, commentators can do it, and countries that have no real skin in the game can do it.  But when you are the President of the United States of America and you’re trying to bring about peace the way Donald Trump is trying to bring about peace, the only way to do it is you have to create space for people to come to the table and talk.  And that is something we should all be applauding, not criticizing —

QUESTION:  The one —

SECRETARY RUBIO:  — and not pretending that we can just extend this war forever until – and that everybody has unlimited resources to continue to fund it – on both sides, by the way.

QUESTION:  And President Zelenskyy has said he does want this war to end, he just cares about how it ends.  We heard that from the other European leaders who came to the Oval Office also this week.  President Trump said to me today before that shouting match erupted in the Oval Office that he doesn’t believe there have to be security guarantees in place before the ceasefire, that you can come to a ceasefire agreement and then put those in place.  Do you agree with that?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  That’s not what he said.  What he said is why am I going to be talking about security guarantees, let me get a peace deal first, is what he said.  That doesn’t mean they can’t happen —

QUESTION:  Right.

SECRETARY RUBIO:  — as part of that negotiation, but you have to an agreement.  What is there – what peace is there to secure if you first don’t have an agreement on peace?  Like, what do the Russians need in order to end this conflict?  What do the Ukrainians need?

QUESTION:  So you’re saying it would happen as part of the negotiations?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, again, why do you end a war?  You have to find out what the combatants require in order to stop shooting at each other.  What are the Russians’ needs?  What do they need to see in order for them to stop fighting?  What do the Ukrainians need in order to stop fighting?  And then once you have that in place, then you can decide the next step, which is, and what do we need to do to make sure this never happens again – that it doesn’t happen in two years, three years, five years?  I don’t think President Trump is interested in a one-year ceasefire; I don’t think he’s interested in a six-month ceasefire.  He wants this thing to end.  He has said that repeatedly.

But again, he’s not going to use the kind of language that maybe plays well in the public sphere and the political sphere for people that want to take shots at him but it’s not going to allow us to have a negotiation or even to explore a potential negotiation.  President Donald Trump is a man who’s made deals his entire life in business, and he’s bringing those principles to government, and he’s the only one in the world that has any chance.  If Donald Trump tomorrow decides I don’t care about Ukraine, I don’t care about Russia, and I don’t care about this war, and he walks away, I ask you – I ask everyone – well, who on this planet has any chance whatsoever, even a 1 percent chance, of getting the combatants to the table?  The answer is there is no one.  He is the only one on Earth right now that has any chance.  If there is a chance at peace, he’s the only one that has a chance to deliver on it.

QUESTION:  Is he – do you still see a meeting happening with President Putin there, President Zelenskyy, and President Trump?  Is that still possible?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, I think that’s premature.  I mean, what would they – you first need to make sure that this is even a possibility and you have to explore it.  And look, there’s good signs, I think, maybe, somewhat about at least the Russians’ willingness to engage.  And – but we have to explore all that.  But that’s not going to be done in front of cameras, it’s not going to be done in an open ballroom.  There’s a lot of work to be done before we get to this point.  This is a complex war that has causes behind it that go back a number of years.  There’s a lot to navigate, a lot that’s been invested on both sides.  Gains have been made by the Russian Federation in some places.  All of these things have to be worked through, but it’s not going to be done through press conferences and in the media.  It has to be done through what the Vice President said today: the serious work of diplomacy.

It’s – it’s a lot easier to just say, well, we’re with Ukraine all the way no matter what, however long it takes.  Well, 15 years?

QUESTION:  Yeah.

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Twelve years?  I mean, that’s absurd.  That’s not sustainable and everybody knows it.  The President wants to end this war.  He wants to explore whether there’s the possibility to do it and do it quickly.  He campaigned on it.  It was a promise of his and he intends to – when he says these things, he doesn’t just say them, he means them.  And he’s doing it, and it’s the first time we’ve seen that in a long time in American politics.

QUESTION:  Secretary Marco Rubio, thank you for your time tonight and joining us on such a historic day.  I really do appreciate your time.

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Thank you.

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Should I?  (Laughter.)  Sure enough.  I’m sure we’ve covered all your questions.  Go ahead.

QUESTION:  We have a long —

QUESTION:  What was your message to the Russian foreign minister today?  And what is the Trump Administration’s strategy now to end the Ukraine war?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Our strategy is to continue to engage all the parties that are involved in finding an outcome to this conflict.  We will engage anytime that we have an opportunity to do so, like we did today.  I echoed what the President said – both the disappointment and frustration at the lack of progress in peace talks or in a path forward.  So, we’ll continue to engage.

We shared some ideas and comments, which I’ll take back to Washington as early as this evening in terms of calls and reflected, and perhaps there’s something to build on there.  So – but it was a frank conversation.  It was an important one.  We had it, and we talked about some other items as well unrelated to the war in Ukraine, but that was the – obviously, the first and foremost topic that we discussed.  And look, the President’s been pretty clear.  He’s disappointed and frustrated that there’s not been more flexibility on the Russian side to bring about an end to this conflict.  We hope that can change, and we’re going to continue to stay involved where we see opportunities to make a difference.

QUESTION:  Mr. Secretary —

QUESTION:  Without speaking for the foreign minister, which I know you don’t want to know to do —

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Which foreign minister?

QUESTION:  This one.

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Oh, Sergei Lavrov.

QUESTION:  Mr. Lavrov.

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Yes.

QUESTION:  Yeah.  Without speaking for him, do you get the sense that they’re moving towards flexibility or —

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Yeah, I’m not going to characterize our conversation other than to tell you that I expressed what the President said publicly, which is that we feel as if we’ve dedicated a lot of time and energy to this matter and just not enough progress has been made.  We need to see a roadmap moving forward about how this conflict can conclude, and then we shared some ideas about what that might look like.  And obviously, I’ll take that back to the President here as early as this evening, and hopefully there’s something that we can build on there.  But we’ll —

QUESTION:  Secretary —

QUESTION:  Mr. Secretary —

QUESTION:  — a couple of months ago, you said that what was necessary to end this war would be a conversation between President Trump and President Putin, but there have now been multiple phone calls between the two of them, and yet the war in Ukraine goes on.  Does this speak to any weakness, in terms of the President’s ability to negotiate an end to this conflict?  Or why does it persist, despite them having spoken?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, this is a war that the President inherited, right?  He got elected, and it had already been going on, and no progress had been made up to that point towards peace of any kind.  In fact, there had not even been any meetings between the Ukrainians and the Russians for quite some time.  So, while there’s been some humanitarian exchanges made – obviously, that’s our goal here is to end this war and any role we can play.

So, this is not a war that started under President Trump.  It’s a war that wouldn’t have happened had he been president, but now it’s here.  And we’ll continue to engage and do everything we can and hopefully make progress.  As I said, and I said repeatedly, look, we are – if we see an opportunity to make a difference in this, we’re going to take it and we’re going to pursue it.  And that’s what the President has done.  And he deserves tremendous credit for having multiple phone calls with leaders from both countries —

QUESTION:  With sanctions?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  — and anybody else.

QUESTION:  Mr. Secretary —

QUESTION:  Mr. Secretary, Poland —

QUESTION:  — the – Russia has launched its most massive attacks in the last three days.  And you, of course, saw your counterpart today.  Are you willing now to put stronger sanctions on Russia?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, the President has said that that’s an option that’s available to him – both under existing authorities, but primarily if the Senate and the House can pass legislation that gives him the opportunity to do that.  So, we’ve been engaging with Congress on what that bill would like.  Obviously, the President needs flexibility on how those sanctions would be applied and when, because it gives him maximum leverage in any conversation and negotiation.  So, he has talked about that as being a real option.

And now obviously, we’ll – we’ve been engaging with the Senate in particular over the last week on what that bill would look like, and the leaders of both chambers have said that they’re prepared to begin to move forward on that.  We’ve expressed this to the Russians weeks ago.  We told them that the moment would come where something like this could happen, and we’ll continue to express it because that’s the reality.

QUESTION:  But has the moment come, or not yet?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, again, that’s the President’s decision to make.  We are – obviously, he’s frustrated by the fact that more progress has not been made.

QUESTION:  Mr. Secretary —

QUESTION:  Mr. Secretary —

QUESTION:  — there were reports earlier this week that you and the President were unaware that the Pentagon had made a decision to at least temporarily halt the arms shipments to Ukraine.  Were you – what’s your take on that decision by the Pentagon?  And what is your general take —

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, I think that decision has been —

QUESTION:  — on the arm shipments?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Yeah, that decision unfortunately was mischaracterized.  It was a pause, pending review, on a handful of specific type munitions.  That frankly is something that is logical that you would do, especially after an extended engagement that we saw both in defense of Israel and in defense of our own bases.  And so, it was a very limited review of certain types of munitions to ensure that we had sufficient stockpiles.  And it’s typical when you do these reviews that there’s a short term pause because if, in fact, the review comes back that you have a shortage, you can’t pull it back once it’s been sent.  But generally speaking, aid to Ukraine continues along the schedule that Congress appropriated.

QUESTION:  Mr. Secretary —

QUESTION:  Which types were paused?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Huh?

QUESTION:  Which types of weapons were paused?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Largely defensive in nature.  Some were offensive.  But again, the ones that were expended in recent conflicts in the Middle East – and again, not because there is a shortage but because it’s prudent to look at it and say, okay, do we have enough of these in our stockpiles for all of our obligations around the world – both in defense of our bases in the Middle East but also our obligations to our Indo-Pacific partners and any other contingencies that might arise.

But in the end, I would say that the overwhelming majority of defense – of military aid that the United States provides Ukraine has never been paused and continues along the same schedules that it’s been.

I think there’s a broader issue unrelated to the pause, and that involves the defense productive capabilities of the West, not just us but of Europe.  As an example, one of the things that the Ukrainians need is more Patriot batteries.  There are Patriot batteries available in multiple countries in Europe, yet no one wants to part with them.  So, I hope that will change.  If, in fact, Ukraine is the priority that so many in countries – so many countries in Europe say it is, they should be willing to share batteries that right now they don’t have a need to use.

So, hopefully, we’ll be able to convince some of our NATO partners to provide those Patriot batteries to Ukraine, because there are a number of countries that have them, but no one wants to part with what they have, so perhaps that’ll change.  That’s important.

QUESTION:  Mr. Secretary, you mentioned wanting to see a roadmap for how this conflict can conclude.  What concrete ideas have been presented, and how did Russia respond in this meeting?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, I – again, these things are best negotiated – I don’t want to – in private, and that’s how these things generally work.  There were some ideas exchanged today, some viewpoints that they expressed to us that I’ll take back to the President for his consideration, and hopefully it will lead to something.  I don’t want to over-promise something.  Again, as I said, this is a conflict that’s been going on now for three – over three years, and as has already been pointed out by one of the questions here, we’ve seen an acceleration of attacks.  I think it’s the – probably the largest drone attack in a city close to the Polish border, actually.  So, it’s a pretty deep strike.

And again, I mean, it’s – every time you see this in the headlines and people die, it reminds you of why the President wants this war to end.  As he has said from the beginning, his number one interest here is to stop people from dying and the destruction that’s ongoing every single day.  They’re going to be having a conference – maybe it starts today, if I’m not mistaken – about reconstruction and the rebuilding of Ukraine.  Every time one of these strikes is launched, the price of reconstruction goes up, right?  There’s also the destruction of the country’s capabilities, the country’s economic capabilities, that has to be added to this.

But obviously the loss of life is something of grave interest – of great interest to the President.  It’s important to note that since January of this year, as an example just to give you, on the Russian side, they’ve lost 100,000 soldiers – dead – not injured – dead.  And on the Ukrainian side, the numbers are less but still very significant.  And so that’s – the President doesn’t like wars.  He thinks wars are a waste of money and a waste of lives, and he wants them to end.  And he’s going to do everything he can within his power to end this war and any other war he has a chance to end, as you’ve seen in the past.

And so, we’re going to continue to work at it.  We understand that these things take time and patience, but obviously we’re also frustrated that more progress has not been made.  And hopefully, based on today and in the days to come, we’ll have more clarity about what exactly the Russian position and priorities are in this regard, and can begin to make some progress.  But it’s been difficult, as you’ve seen.

QUESTION:  May I ask an ASEAN question?

QUESTION:  China’s been supporting Russia.  Will you meet with your Chinese counterpart here this week to speak with him about —

SECRETARY RUBIO:  I think we’re working on that.  Maybe – maybe we’ll meet, and obviously we’ll talk about it.  I think the Chinese clearly have been supportive of the Russian effort, and I think that generally they’ve been willing to help them as much as they can without getting caught.  But people in Europe and other parts of the world have noticed.  But in the end, this peace, if it’s possible and doable, will happen between Ukraine and Russia, and we are willing to do whatever we can to help bring it to an end.

QUESTION:  Can I ask an ASEAN question?

QUESTION:  These ideas that Russia —

SECRETARY RUBIO:  A what?

QUESTION:  An ASEAN question?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Yeah, of course.  That’s why we’re here, right?

QUESTION:  Can I ask you one more quick question on Russia?  Just these ideas that were put on the table today, would you characterize them as new ideas from the Russian side that the Trump Administration had not heard before?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Yes.  Well, I think maybe – yes, I think it’s a new and a different approach.  Again, I wouldn’t characterize it as something that guarantees a peace, but it’s a concept that we’ll – I’ll take back to the President today and – here as soon as I finish with you.

QUESTION:  I just wanted to know – what was your sense today after your meeting, the PMC meeting with the ASEAN foreign ministers, about how big an irritant tariffs are to U.S. relations, both with ASEAN as a bloc but individual countries?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, I think – look, there are two things to understand.  Number one is these letters that are going out and these trade changes, they’re happening with every country in the world – I mean, basically every country in the world.  The President’s been very clear, and he has been – frankly, if you go back to videos of him speaking in the ’80s about his feeling that the state of global trade is unfair to the United States, that for far too long we allowed these imbalances to develop.  We are the world’s largest consumer.  We’re a huge market, where people export things to us, and these huge and unsustainable imbalances have developed with countries all over the world.

And so, this is a globalized effort to reset U.S. trade in a way that’s beneficial to the United States, and not just in dollars and cents but also in our own domestic industrial capacity.  So, this has been made clear to countries around the world.  We were coming up upon June – about the middle of this month, and the markets demand certainty, and so these letters set a baseline.

Now, obviously that does not foreclose the opportunity for individual countries to enter into negotiations that perhaps can adjust those numbers.  But in the end, the President still remains very committed to a rebalancing of trade that’s fair to America and also, at the same time, protects our own industrial capabilities.

QUESTION:  Right.  But you’re here today meeting with ASEAN countries, and those countries, almost all of them, got letters.  So, I’m just wondering —

SECRETARY RUBIO:  But anywhere in the world – well —

QUESTION:  I understand that, but —

SECRETARY RUBIO:  My point to you is anywhere in the world I would have traveled this week, they got a letter.  So, everybody got a letter, and in some cases, some of these countries got a letter where their tariff rate is lower than some of their neighbors or maybe a country somewhere else in the world that might even serve as an advantage.  But of course, it’s raised. It’s an issue, but I wouldn’t say it solely defines our relationship with many of these countries.  There are a lot of other issues that we work together on, and I think there was great enthusiasm that we were here and that we’re a part of this.  A reminder that next week, we’ll have another high-ranking delegation, including Secretary Lutnick.  Deputy Landau from the Department of State will be traveling to Japan for the World Expo there, and they’ll be involved in talks there as well.

You know my very first meeting – I don’t know if you know this, but when I was sworn in I went to the State Department, I gave a speech on the steps, and then my first meeting right out of the box was with Japan, South Korea, and India.  And we’ve repeated that meeting numerous times since then with that group (inaudible).  We have a running internal joke with my counterpart from Japan:  I have literally now seen him about 8 to 12 times, and our joke is that we see each other more than we see our own – our own families.

And so, these engagements are very important to us.  And we’re going to continue to stay very committed, because this – as I said to all of our partners, this notion or idea that the United States would ever be distracted by the Indo-Pacific or even Southeast Asia is impossible.  You can’t be – maybe it doesn’t always – wars get more attention, but it’s impossible to not be focused.  This is where much of the story of the 21st century is going to be written.  This is where two thirds of economic growth is going to happen over the next 25 or 30 years.

And many of the countries of Southeast Asia – not only are they some of the youngest countries in the world, but they’re about to see an enormous expansion of their labor markets, their labor pool, number of workers.  This is a historic, once-in-a-generation opportunity not just for these countries to revolutionize themselves from an economic standpoint, but further strengthen our relationship.  We have over 6,000 American companies that have invested heavily in these economies over the last 20 or 30 years.  These are – we’re not abandoning those relationships.  On the contrary, we want to strengthen and build upon them.

And there are a bunch of other issues.  And certainly, trade is part of it, but there are a lot of other issues that we work together on, and we continue to highly prioritize that.  The story of the 21st century will be written in the Indo-Pacific.  And the countries represented here today, along with others that have joined to be a part of this, represent some of the – not just important markets, some of the most important partners we have in the world.

QUESTION:  Secretary Rubio —

MODERATOR:  Last question.

QUESTION:  This is obviously a very quick trip.  Do you intend to come back to Asia or to Southeast Asia —

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Sure.

QUESTION:  — maybe on a longer trip sometime in the future, near future?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Sure, absolutely.  This was a great trip because we got to see 12, 13, 14, 15 countries that are all here.  So, these forums – there’ll be a leaders forum here in October, which we look forward to being a part of it.  We’ve also engaged with many of our colleagues here at different forums – many of them, for example, not just at the G7 foreign ministers, they also attended on the sidelines of NATO at the foreign minister level and also at the leaders level.  So, we’ll continue to engage with the region, both in Washington and other places around the world, and in our return travel here.  And so, we’ll be back.

In addition – and it’s not just me.  The Secretary of Defense has been out here, the Deputy Secretary of State will be here next week.  So, we’ll look for other – obviously, the leaders forum will be here in October as well.  So, we’ll be here, we’ll be engaged, as we do every single day.

MODERATOR:  (Inaudible).

QUESTION:  Secretary, there’s a review right now by the administration of the AUKUS deal that the last administration forged, and I think that raises some question among Asian-Pacific allies and partners about the U.S. defense commitment here in Asia.  What do you say to people who are —

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Yeah.  Well, look, anytime a new administration takes over, there’s a review of all policies.  I mean, policies are reviewed; doesn’t necessarily mean you’re against it.  We did a review at the State Department of our diplomatic presence around the world, because I wanted to know which consulates and embassies could be adjusted both in their size and in their presence, could we consolidate their presence.  We did a review; we haven’t closed any embassies.  But we did a review.  So just because you’re reviewing something doesn’t mean you’re going to necessarily act on it.  It means you’re a new administration, and you want to take an audit, an account, about all the policies that you’ve inherited – and policies, how they’ve changed since the last time you were in office when it comes to the Trump administration.

So – but our policies on AUKUS have not changed.

MODERATOR:  Thank you.

SECRETARY RUBIO:  What else?

QUESTION:  Are you hopeful on a Gaza ceasefire in the next few days?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, we’re hopeful.  I mean, in the end, we’re hoping they’ll move to proximity talks.  It appears that generally the terms have been agreed to, but obviously now you need to have talks about you implement those terms.  And I spoke to Steve Witkoff last night, and he’s optimistic that proximity talks will begin fairly soon, expedited and facilitated by the Qataris and the Egyptians.  And so – but we’ve seen talks fall apart in the past at that stage of proximity talks.

So, I think we’re closer, and I think perhaps we’re closer than we’ve been in quite a while, and we’re hopeful.  But we also recognize there are still some challenges in the way, and one of the fundamental challenges is Hamas’s unwillingness to disarm, which would end this conflict immediately.  If they just released the hostages – there shouldn’t be a single hostage.  There shouldn’t be a single hostage body still left.  If they released that and disarmed, this would end.

But that said, the Israelis have shown some flexibility here, and so I think we’ve – we’ve seen progress made.  So, we’re hopeful, but we also understand that these things are – have been difficult for a reason.  But we are – we’re hopeful that they can move to proximity talks pretty quickly and go from there, and have a ceasefire in place in the near future.

QUESTION:  Are there any sticking points from the Israeli side, such as on aid or the withdrawal of Israeli troops?  Where does that stand?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, the sticking point would be on the Hamas side.  I mean, Hamas – they should want Israel to withdraw completely and allow them to go back to being Hamas.  Obviously, the Israelis aren’t going to agree to that.

I think the easiest way to end this – that’s not what the agreement is, but the easiest way to end this is for all the hostages to be released and for Hamas to disarm.  Absent that, the Israelis and Hamas, through the intermediation – in the intermediation of Qatar and Egypt, have reached an understanding: a 60-day ceasefire, and some elements of that with regards to humanitarian aid through international agencies resuming, and so forth.  But now you’ve got to have talks about how you implement that.  And that’s where this has fallen apart in the past.  We’re hopeful that’ll work out.  We’re doing everything we can.  We’d like to see a ceasefire.  The President’s been clear he wants to see a ceasefire, and we’ve invested a lot of time and energy.  I know Steve Witkoff works every – hours every single day on this topic alone.  So, we’ve invested a lot of time into that.  We’d like to see it happen.

Okay?

QUESTION:  The AI impersonator of you, anything you can say about who is behind that?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  No – no, I mean, anybody – it could happen to anybody and every – especially if you’re a public figure, there’s got to be – like, they could take the interview I did here today and change it around, so – but as soon as I found out about it last week, I referred it to the FBI, Diplomatic Security, and others.  It won’t be the last time you see me or others, for that matter – maybe some of you will be impersonated, but it’s just a reality of this AI technology that’s going on, and it’s a real threat.  But —

QUESTION:  How did you find out?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Oh, somebody called me – the senator that called me and said, “Hey, did you just try to reach me?” and actually sent me a voice recording – it didn’t sound – I don’t think it really sounded like me.  Maybe he fell for that call, but – but maybe there was a better one that I didn’t see.

QUESTION:  It was on Signal, right?  So does this —

SECRETARY RUBIO:  I don’t know how they got it or if it was a voicemail.  No, it doesn’t matter what form you use.  I mean, it doesn’t matter if it’s Signal or anything else.

QUESTION:  But there are more secure methods, though.  On Signal, you can create an account with an email address, and that is one of the reasons that they were able to reach out to people and then use the voicemail messages to imitate your voice.

SECRETARY RUBIO:  I’ve had people in the past ask me if I texted – like, within days of becoming Secretary of State, I had foreign ministers calling the State Department asking if I had just texted them.  So, I don’t know, guys.  This is just the reality of the 21st century with AI and fake stuff that’s going on.  It’s – generally I communicate with my counterparts around the world through official channels for a reason, and that’s to avoid this.  So —

QUESTION:  Do you have any sense of who the perpetrator is?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  No.  I mean, the perpetrator is somebody with an AI software.  That could be anybody in the world.  My sense is the target really isn’t me.  The target is the people they’re reaching out to, to try to trick them into a call or whatever.  And who knows what they do with it?  But you’re going to hear about this for a long time, and not just me.  It’ll happen to other people, because all you need is a recording of someone’s voice and you can come up with it.  So yeah, it’s just one of the other great challenges posed to us by AI.  I’m sure there’s a lot of positive aspects to AI as well, but this ain’t one of them.

QUESTION:  You said, Secretary, that the weapons pause by the Pentagon, in the narrow scope in which it occurred, made sense.  But was it a decision on which the State Department was consulted, or what was the level of —

SECRETARY RUBIO:  No, it wasn’t a – I know, I said it was a review, a pause pending a review.  And so, you – we’re constantly – the Pentagon is constantly reviewing stockpiles, especially after an engagement such as the one we had in the Middle East.  So, my point is that there wasn’t a policy decision not to give weapons to Ukraine.  It was a review in which certain munitions were temporarily paused for that review and for that purpose.  And this reporting out there that there was no awareness of it is not true.  Now – but no policy decision was made, in essence.  No one ever said we’re not sending weapons to Ukraine.  That’s been appropriated by Congress, and that’s continued, and that continues to this very day.

But when you’re doing a review, there’s some period of time in which during that review, it’s possible that some shipping is slowed down – not stopped, but because it’s being reviewed, someone would say, okay, well, let’s not send it today, let’s wait a couple days because we’re conducting a review of that particular munition.  So that’s what happened here, and I think it was not appropriately reported, initially.  But nonetheless, it’s pretty clear now that review has occurred.  And as the President’s made clear, there has been no change to our posture with regards to providing what we have available.

Now, I would remind everybody – again, I go back to the point I made, and that is that there are certain things that Ukraine needs like Patriot batteries.  Those are available.  There are multiple countries in Europe that possess Patriot batteries that they could share with Ukraine, and we’re actively talking to countries about doing that.

QUESTION:  Anyone specifically?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, the Spaniards have them.  They’re really far from Ukraine and they have one.  The Germans have, others have them – I’m not singling them out, but I’m just telling you those are two that I know.  There are other Patriot batteries, and there are other opportunities.  Countries that have ordered Patriot batteries that are about to receive shipments of them, it’d be great if one of them volunteered to defer that shipment and send it to Ukraine instead.  So, we’re looking for creative ways to provide them these defensive weapons that they would need.

Now, that’s not going to help them with the drone attacks.  That’s a very different technique that we use in order to bring those down.  But it would help them with some of these missile attacks that we’re seeing.  Again, these are defensive weapons.

QUESTION:  The reduction in force of the State Department, is that something that we should expect to happen while you are traveling, or is it something you want to be in Washington, D.C. while it happens?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  No, I mean, we’ve already notified that to Congress.  Understand our reduction in force was done – I’m very proud to say, I think, I would argue, probably in the most deliberate way of anyone that’s done one.  We went very specifically through and reorganized the State Department.  And when you reorganize the State Department, there were certain bureaus we wanted to empower, the regional bureaus, and there were certain bureaus, these functional bureaus, that were closed.  And so, it made sense to – so that’s been notified to Congress and to the workforce for some period of time.  And so, we’ve been ready to implement it pending a court decision, which now has been reached.

There’s some timing associated with how you do that, how you actually implement it, but our intent is to move forward with the plans that we’ve notified Congress of weeks ago and that we took months to design.

QUESTION:  Will the numbers be the same as what was notified to Congress?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Sure.  I mean, our plan that we notified to Congress is what we intend to do, and then we’ll have (inaudible) our – again, the reduction of force is a consequence of the reorg.  It’s not a consequence of getting – trying to get rid of people.  But if you close the bureau, you don’t need those positions.  Understand that some of these are positions that are being eliminated, not people.  Some of them are unfilled positions for potential – or positions that someone took early retirement, and therefore are now – or about to be unfilled.

So – but we took a very deliberate step to reorganize the State Department to be more efficient and more focused.  That’s been publicly noticed to Congress months ago; we’ve been prepared to implement it.  And the thing that slowed us down was a court decision by a district judge in the northern district of California.  The Supreme Court has ruled on that, and so we’re prepared to act on it.  It’ll come as no surprise, and that is our reorg.  That’ll be the extent of what we intend to do, and we’re already operating under the new organizational structure as-is for the most part.  So, this will further enhance that.

Okay?  Thank you.

QUESTION:  Thank you.
