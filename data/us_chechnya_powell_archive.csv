Colin Powell,20030501,Interview With Russian Television NTV,"INTERVIEWER: Welcome to Russia.
SECRETARY POWELL: Thank you very much. It's good to be back.
QUESTION: Well, you were not unanimously welcome to the two countries you came last. There were suicide bombings in Saudi Arabia and Russia, Chechnya. President Putin said that these two series of terrorist attacks actually had the same origins. You agreed with him. In that case, do you suppose, do you think that the Chechen guerillas, Hamas, Hezbollah, and Al Qaida guerillas are all the same?
SECRETARY POWELL: They're all the same in that they are terrorist organizations that that are determined to use violence, the killing of innocent people to achieve an end. They say it is a political end, but very often I think it is nothing but a criminal end. And, so to the extent that we all have to go after terrorists, these are all linked as terrorist organizations, and we have to find a way to direct the anger of people, the anxiety of people, the frustration of people, the hopes of people into a political process and away from any suggestion that criminals who call themselves terrorists have a place in the civilized world. 
QUESTION: Mr. Secretary. There are two extreme opinions. The Chechen fighters in the mountains say they're fighting for national liberation and say in Moscow, most of the political leaders, I would say absolute majority, are convinced that it's international terrorism. Where is the truth?
SECRETARY POWELL: The truth is for someone else to decide, not me. I know that there are terrorist organizations in Chechnya. We have through our own information and through our own resources identified several of them that we have put on our list of terrorist organizations and have taken sanctions against them. We have to be very careful to make sure that when we identify, at least in our system, organizations that are conducting these kinds of attacks that we can justify with information and intelligence that they are terrorists, that they are using terrorist financing, and that they have no interest in the political process. They have no interest in anything but killing innocent people. Often cloaked in the context of a political objective, but very often not in that cloak. And, as a result, it is important for people to reject this as a way to find a solution. What we saw in Saudi Arabia yesterday when I was there. It wasn't directed at me. I only recently announced my visit, only for a week. They'd been planning it for a long time. They were going after American interests. They were going after a partnership between Saudi Arabia and Americans that benefits both Saudi Arabians and Americans. How dare they? Why should they? Who are they? Where do they get the right to use bombs to kill innocent people sleeping in their beds? They don't have such a right. And, what we are seeing throughout the world now: two attacks in Chechnya in the past two days, attack in Saudi Arabia, attack in Yemen, attacks elsewhere in the world. Is this to be in any way tolerated? Is this to be in any way justified? What kind of world do we become? What sort of future will there be for the civilized world if we don't come together and fight this kind of terrorism where it exists?
QUESTION: Two questions follow from what you have just said. Is why did it take the United States such a long time to list the Chechen guerillas in the terrorists list? It took September 11 to happen so that the United States realize that Chechnya is a place of international terrorism. Why so long?
SECRETARY POWELL: We realize that Chechnya is place where there are terrorist organizations, but we have a system of laws, a system of regulations where we are required under our law to make an examination of information provided to us, intelligence we can gather. And we go through this because we are a nation of law and we apply the laws in a very, very careful way. It is not a matter of just snapping your finger one day and the next day saying I designate you as a terrorist organization. It is because of the record of terrorism and information that I can present to our Congress or to a court that justifies my placing the name of that organization on our terrorist list. It takes time, and in this instance it took some time.
QUESTION: And, the second point. The terrorist attacks in Saudi Arabia. Do you think this is a response to American victory in Iraq? 
SECRETARY POWELL: I think it is Al Qaida. We can't be absolutely sure, but my judgment it is Al Qaida. And Al Qaida has been targeting American interests for years. They targeted our ship in Yemen when they blew a hole in it and killed a number of our young sailors. They targeted our embassies in Africa. They targeted New York City and Washington and they brought another plane down in the countryside of Pennsylvania, one of our states. And, so the Al Qaida organization has been attacking America across a broad front over many years, and this was a continuation of that attack, not directly linked to what we did in Iraq. They have this view that somehow the Saudi government should not be free to invite the American presence in Saudi Arabia because it serves the interests of both Saudi Arabia and the United States. They do not approve of that, they don't like that, so they've been trying to drive us out Saudi Arabia and out of that part of the world but for a number of years. But, we have friends and we have interests in the Gulf Area, in the Middle East and we will represent our interests and we will defend our friends and to the extent that our friends want our presence in the area, either our political presence, our diplomatic presence or, on occasion, our military presence. We will be there to help our friends. What's interesting is, the Iraq war has now been concluded, the active combat phase, and we have just announced that most of our troops will be leaving Saudi Arabia. So, what basis was there for an attack on that rationale? None whatsoever. It is just part of this terrorist, criminal, murderous organization reaching out, and nobody should try very hard to find some way of justifying their action by saying that, well, Americans shouldn't be in Saudi Arabia. Americans should be doing more here or other nations should be doing more there. And, if you don't do so, then this one organization, Al Qaida, led by we don't know who right now, has the right to go get bombs, to go get guns, to go get all kinds of terrible weapons to kill innocent people who might be sleeping in their bed. Not going after an armed enemy, but going after targets where they know they can get access. In the case of New York City, people who came from 90 different countries, who just went to work in the World Trade Center -- ninety different countries represented in the World Trade Center. Should they have all been sent to their death because this one organization, outside all the rules of law, outside any norm of civilization, decides that they have some misbegotten cause, and they should have the right to do such a thing? No. We must strike back. We must respond. To these kinds of organizations or similar organizations, wherever they appear. And no country is invulnerable. No country is safe from this kind of attack. 
QUESTION: When you say you don't know who runs Al Qaida now. You mean that you don't know what the fate of Bin Laden is? 
SECRETARY POWELL: I do not know whether he is alive or dead. 
QUESTION: Mr. Secretary. My colleague journalists describe a rather troublesome situation in Iraq. It's chaos in Baghdad. It's chaos in the countryside. And Basra, for instance, as well. And somebody talks about the possibility of a domino effect, in a sense that we can get this chaos spreading in the Arab world. Now, connecting to that President Putin, before the beginning of the war, always said, ""America and us are partners. And because we partners, I must warn them they are making a mistake."" After your meeting on Wednesday with President Putin, did you have a feeling that he's changing his mind?
SECRETARY POWELL: No. President Putin felt very strongly that the United States should not undertake military action. He worked both in the UN Security Council to make that position well known and he talked directly to President Bush about it. Foreign Minister Ivanov, my colleague, he and I had the most intense discussions about this issue. We had strong disagreement here. And I would not expect either President Putin or Foreign Minister Ivanov to say that they didn't have that strong view and it's all behind us. We did have a disagreement, but because we are partners we can talk to one another directly. In the most heated way. And now that that matter has been resolved, we did what we felt we had to do, Russia felt the need to criticize our actions, but that does not break up the partnership. There are so many other things that pull us together. The desire now to work together in the United Nations for a new resolution that will help the Iraqi people and not to fight old battles. And the United States and the Russian Federation are pulled together by our economic interests, by our common commitment to democracy, and to the opening up of markets. We want to help Russia with accession to the World Trade Organization. We have delegations going back and forth talking about agricultural issues and commercial issues, trade issues, and investment opportunities. I, earlier this week when I was in Moscow, also here in your city, I also talked to a group of leaders who came together to talk about a new problem, HIV/AIDS. And, we have some experience and we can help Russia with our experience. And so, there are so many things that pull us together, and so many mutual interests that we have, that those things that pull us together will cause us to have a strong partnership. I'm absolutely confident of that and I'm sure that will be demonstrated to the world when our two Presidents meet in St. Petersburg in the near future. And, it was also demonstrated when the Duma ratified the Treaty of Moscow reducing the number of strategic nuclear weapons on both sides.
QUESTION: Mr. Secretary. You talked about this a second ago. The resolution to allow to lift sanctions on Iraq. Now, Russia has a different point of view. You have threatened the world, the United States, for a year and a half that there are of mass destruction in Iraq, and so far nobody has found them. So, if the war was carried out because of weapons of mass destruction, so maybe let's let the inspectors go back and make us all sure in the world that there aren't -- or there are, but the fact that they're not found yet, the weapons of mass destruction, isn't it troublesome?
SECRETARY POWELL: Well, we have started to identify some vehicles that are very suspicious in nature and look quite similar to some of the vehicles that I presented in my speech to the United Nations on the fifth of February. So we'll continue to examine those vehicles to see whether they are mobile biological laboratories. We are going through a great deal of documentation that our troops have picked up, and we have thousands of experts and soldiers who will be examining the entire country and look at suspected sights. Whether or not there is a role for UNMOVIC to play in the absence of the Saddam Hussein regime is an entirely different situation. This is something they'll have to examine. I'm aware that some of our Security Council partners, including the Russian Federation, believe that there is a role for UNMOVIC. We believe that that may not be the case any longer. But it's an area that we'll have to debate. I don't subscribe to the domino theory, that what we have done in Iraq will necessarily bring down regimes all over the area. What we have done in Iraq is get rid of a terrible dictator. A dictator who we know was developing weapons of mass destruction. You tell me why he didn't let the United Nations have full access. You tell me why he didn't turn over the documentation, why he didn't account for all the things he has been doing for the last 12 years. For 12 years, he ignored the UN. We also know that he had such weapons. He has used such weapons in the past. And, on top of that, he terrorized his population, he wasted the revenue of the people on weapons and on building up a military force to threaten his neighbors. He killed people. He murdered people. We're now finding mass graves, full of innocent people who were murdered by this regime. And, so the United States is not going to apologize. Nor are our coalition partners going to apologize for undertaking this military operation which will determine whether there are any remaining weapons of mass destruction and bring the truth out in due course. And also have the effect of bringing down a dictator, and the world will be better off for it, is better off for it, and the people of Iraq will be better off for it. And they now have an opportunity to use their oil wealth to build a better country that will be a democratic country. That's not a domino theory meaning the United States is going to go somewhere else and do the same thing. Not at all. But, what we might have is an example to the region of what can happen when you don't have dictators around and when you're willing to use the wealth that you have in the ground, your oil, for good purposes.
QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, I would like to clarify one detail, which is very Russian. Because on the eve of war, now we know about it, Yevgeniy Primakov, a former Prime Minister and former Foreign Minister had his last mission to Baghdad. He was asked by The Kremlin to go to that mission. He told Mr. Saddam Hussein, that if he wants to save his country from a tragedy, if he wants to avoid a war, he must go. Saddam Hussein did not, as we know, agree, and the war started. Now, did you know about this initiative in the United States? 
SECRETARY POWELL: I knew about a number of initiatives to include Mr. Primakov. Mr. Primakov wasn't the only one who was conveying this message to Saddam Hussein. Many of the Arab leaders were conveying this message to him. Others in the world, other leaders in the world were saying to him,""Why are you bringing us to the brink of destruction?"" But, Mr. Hussein thought that he could stop the will of the international community. He got certain comfort and certain confidence from debates we were having in the Security Council, where it was clear that some members did not want to support the use of force. But, he misunderstood the determination of a number of the members of the Council and a large, willing coalition led by the United States and the United Kingdom to actually take military action. And, so he had an opportunity to come clean. What was he hiding? What would have been -- if he wasn't hiding something, why didn't he just say, ""I'll give you everything, I'll show you everything, you can send in anybody you want, anywhere you want to go. I will no longer stand in the way. I will no longer make these little moves to make it look like I'm cooperating when I'm not really cooperating."" He had his chance. He had his opportunity. It was the United States that went to the United Nations last September and presented the case and said to the United Nations, here's a dictator, here's a regime that for 12 years has been ignoring this international body, and what are we going to do about it? And, we worked for seven weeks. We passed a resolution supported by the Russian Federation, 15 to 0. And, everybody said they're guilty. That's what the resolution said. Iraq has been doing this. Now they have to come clean. And, if they don't come clean, and if they don't show the inspectors everything they have then serious consequences must fall. Everybody agreed to that. 15-0. We then had a serious debate as to whether or not they were really cooperating. And we could not resolve that disagreement. Some said give the inspectors more time. The United States and a number of other nations said no. All they are doing is trying to stretch it out and make sure that nothing happens. And so, they are using the United Nations against itself and we did not believe that that could continue. So we used the authority of that Resolution 1441 and earlier UN resolutions to undertake military action.
QUESTION: Secretary. There is a strategic problem now. Because the United States, the West, NATO, and Russia as well in a certain sense have two fronts. Afghanistan and Iraq. There is a threat that -- or danger, if you want -- that Afghanistan is going to be forgotten because Iraq is going to draw more and more resources and needs and Afghanistan will remain overlooked. We know that it is an enormous drug production place and that this narco money is sponsoring international terrorism. So, how to solve this?
SECRETARY POWELL: I'm not aware of the Afghan government in any way sponsoring international terrorism. .
INTERVIEWER: No, no.
SECRETARY POWELL: I do know that we have a drug crop problem in Afghanistan.
INTERVIEWER: That's right.
SECRETARY POWELL: And we are working on that. We are trying to find crop substitution measures that we can use to convince Afghan farmers that they ought to invest in something that benefits their country and not grow a crop where all the money flows out of the country. So, it is a major problem and I recognize that. But, we haven't forgotten Afghanistan. There are still American soldiers in Afghanistan. NATO is now getting ready to send a force into Afghanistan and a headquarters into Afghanistan. We're putting hundreds of millions of dollars into Afghanistan. One of the last things I did before leaving Washington to come on this trip, was to meet with our assistance officials to make sure that the construction of the road, a major road that will connect all the major cities, that the paving of that road, the construction of that road is well underway. So, I spend time during my week on Afghanistan, on Iraq, on relations with the Russian Federation and all the other many challenges that face a Secretary of State. So we have not forgotten Afghanistan. We took on a responsibility to help Afghans build a new society, and we are meeting that responsibility. We help put in place a democratic government, women are now back in the workplace, in education, in the health care system. We're building hospitals, we're building schools, we're building a new army that will protect the nation from the warlords, and from outside influence. We are able to do that and at the same time deal with our responsibilities in Iraq. We picked up the same kind of responsibilities when we conducted our military operation in Iraq, and we knew the challenges we would be facing. It's been difficult. We have a lot more work to do with respect to security, stability, rebuilding the infrastructure. But, we understand the challenge and we will meet the challenge as we have in the past. 
QUESTION: So, Mr. Secretary, the United States, according to interviews that you gave in the recent past is taking a new responsibility, the Middle East crisis, the Palestinian and Israeli crisis, and you said that its President Bush's priority now, and the roadmap is the road to peace as outlined. Given that the Palestinian side seems to be accepting, at least the new Prime Minister, seems to be accepting the roadmap. On the Israeli side you have conditions and resistance. How far is the United States ready to go to force this peace - this road to peace - on Israel?
SECRETARY POWELL: You can't enforce something on a democratic nation. What we can do is try to create conditions where both sides see it is in their interest to come together and follow a particular path to peace. We have had very candid conversations with the Palestinian side and with the Israeli side this week. We hope that a meeting will be coming up soon between the Israeli side and the Palestinian side. Mr. Sharon will be coming to Washington in the next few days in order to discuss these issues with President Bush. And so this is the beginning of the process. There are strong feelings on both sides. What makes this situation new is that we have an elected Prime Minister of the Palestinian people, not Mr. Arafat, who was not an effective leader. He may still be seen as the leader of his country, but he did not lead his country toward peace or toward a Palestinian state. We now have a Prime Minister with authority, Abu Mazen. And President Bush has been waiting for a responsible interlocutor and Prime Minister Sharon ahs been waiting for a responsible interlocutor. So, we will find a way forward. President Bush is determined to find a way forward. 
QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, you said that Yassir Arafat is not anymore a leader, that you don't consider him a leader. He is not a partner for peace. You said in previous interviews. Now, is that position of the United States shared by say President Putin? Does he agree with you that Arafat is no more somebody you can have, you can deal with? 
SECRETARY POWELL: No, I would not presume to speak for President Putin And he can speak for himself . I know that he -- as we -- recognize that Yassir Arafat is the elected president of his people and his people look to him as their leader. What I was saying, what we have said previously, is that he is a failed leader, in that for all these years, that he has been the head of the PLO and the head of the Palestinian people, the leader of the Palestinian people, he has not brought them closer to peace, he has not brought them closer to their dream, which is a Palestinian state. And so we felt strongly that new leadership had to emerge and we now are seeing that new leadership emerge. Not because the United States put in that new leadership but because the Palestinian people through their legislature decided that they needed new leadership and so they created the position of Prime Minister. Not the United States. They brought forth Abu Mazen, named by Mr. Arafat and approved by the Palestinian legislature to be their Prime Minister, and to be given authority as Prime Minister to begin discussions with the Israeli side and with the American side so that we could find a way to move forward to the goal that we all have, and that's a Palestinian state living side by side in peace with Israel.
QUESTION: In Moscow, among the very influential politicians, there is a view that the Quartet, which is working in the Middle East, is a very effective way of solving complicated situations. Now, if you don't say agree on something, like the figure of Arafat, is it not going to make it one plus three instead of four?
SECRETARY POWELL: No. The Quartet agreed on the roadmap. Each member of the quartet has a different view with respect to Chairman Arafat, but the Quartet agreed on the roadmap. We are trying to use the roadmap as a way for Palestinian leaders to emerge and to represent the interests of their people. You can have more than one leader in a movement or in a government. We feel strongly that we have seen Mr. Arafat's leadership over the years. And, I personally have worked with Mr. Arafat for a year and a half before we formed the Quartet. And, frankly, he was not getting the job done or needed to move the peace process along and get closer to the day when the Palestinian people would have a state of their own. The Russian Federation has a different view. The UN, a different view. The European Union, a different view. I respect their views. But, where we found common cause, was the creation of a roadmap that shows the way forward to these two states. One state and one state to be -- the state of Israel and hopefully, a Palestinian state which will emerge -- and they can live side by side in peace. Thank you very much.
INTERVIEWER: Thank you very much.

INTERVIEWER: Welcome to Russia.

SECRETARY POWELL: Thank you very much. It's good to be back.

QUESTION: Well, you were not unanimously welcome to the two countries you came last. There were suicide bombings in Saudi Arabia and Russia, Chechnya. President Putin said that these two series of terrorist attacks actually had the same origins. You agreed with him.

Nor are our coalition partners going to apologize for undertaking this military operation which will determine whether there are any remaining weapons of mass destruction and bring the truth out in due course. And also have the effect of bringing down a dictator, and the world will be better off for it, is better off for it, and the people of Iraq will be better off for it. And they now have an opportunity to use their oil wealth to build a better country that will be a democratic country. That's not a domino theory meaning the United States is going to go somewhere else and do the same thing. Not at all. But, what we might have is an example to the region of what can happen when you don't have dictators around and when you're willing to use the wealth that you have in the ground, your oil, for good purposes.

QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, I would like to clarify one detail, which is very Russian. Because on the eve of war, now we know about it, Yevgeniy Primakov, a former Prime Minister and former Foreign Minister had his last mission to Baghdad. He was asked by The Kremlin to go to that mission. He told Mr. Saddam Hussein, that if he wants to save his country from a tragedy, if he wants to avoid a war, he must go. Saddam Hussein did not, as we know, agree, and the war started. Now, did you know about this initiative in the United States?

SECRETARY POWELL: I knew about a number of initiatives to include Mr. Primakov. Mr. Primakov wasn't the only one who was conveying this message to Saddam Hussein. Many of the Arab leaders were conveying this message to him. Others in the world, other leaders in the world were saying to him,""Why are you bringing us to the brink of destruction?"" But, Mr. Hussein thought that he could stop the will of the international community. He got certain comfort and certain confidence from debates we were having in the Security Council, where it was clear that some members did not want to support the use of force. But, he misunderstood the determination of a number of the members of the Council and a large, willing coalition led by the United States and the United Kingdom to actually take military action. And, so he had an opportunity to come clean. What was he hiding? What would have been -- if he wasn't hiding something, why didn't he just say, ""I'll give you everything, I'll show you everything, you can send in anybody you want, anywhere you want to go. I will no longer stand in the way. I will no longer make these little moves to make it look like I'm cooperating when I'm not really cooperating."" He had his chance. He had his opportunity. It was the United States that went to the United Nations last September and presented the case and said to the United Nations, here's a dictator, here's a regime that for 12 years has been ignoring this international body, and what are we going to do about it? And, we worked for seven weeks. We passed a resolution supported by the Russian Federation, 15 to 0. And, everybody said they're guilty. That's what the resolution said. Iraq has been doing this. Now they have to come clean. And, if they don't come clean, and if they don't show the inspectors everything they have then serious consequences must fall. Everybody agreed to that. 15-0. We then had a serious debate as to whether or not they were really cooperating. And we could not resolve that disagreement. Some said give the inspectors more time. The United States and a number of other nations said no. All they are doing is trying to stretch it out and make sure that nothing happens. And so, they are using the United Nations against itself and we did not believe that that could continue. So we used the authority of that Resolution 1441 and earlier UN resolutions to undertake military action.

QUESTION: Secretary. There is a strategic problem now. Because the United States, the West, NATO, and Russia as well in a certain sense have two fronts. Afghanistan and Iraq. There is a threat that -- or danger, if you want -- that Afghanistan is going to be forgotten because Iraq is going to draw more and more resources and needs and Afghanistan will remain overlooked. We know that it is an enormous drug production place and that this narco money is sponsoring international terrorism. So, how to solve this?

SECRETARY POWELL: I'm not aware of the Afghan government in any way sponsoring international terrorism. .

INTERVIEWER: No, no.

SECRETARY POWELL: I do know that we have a drug crop problem in Afghanistan.

INTERVIEWER: That's right.

SECRETARY POWELL: And we are working on that. We are trying to find crop substitution measures that we can use to convince Afghan farmers that they ought to invest in something that benefits their country and not grow a crop where all the money flows out of the country. So, it is a major problem and I recognize that. But, we haven't forgotten Afghanistan. There are still American soldiers in Afghanistan. NATO is now getting ready to send a force into Afghanistan and a headquarters into Afghanistan. We're putting hundreds of millions of dollars into Afghanistan. One of the last things I did before leaving Washington to come on this trip, was to meet with our assistance officials to make sure that the construction of the road, a major road that will connect all the major cities, that the paving of that road, the construction of that road is well underway. So, I spend time during my week on Afghanistan, on Iraq, on relations with the Russian Federation and all the other many challenges that face a Secretary of State. So we have not forgotten Afghanistan. We took on a responsibility to help Afghans build a new society, and we are meeting that responsibility. We help put in place a democratic government, women are now back in the workplace, in education, in the health care system. We're building hospitals, we're building schools, we're building a new army that will protect the nation from the warlords, and from outside influence. We are able to do that and at the same time deal with our responsibilities in Iraq. We picked up the same kind of responsibilities when we conducted our military operation in Iraq, and we knew the challenges we would be facing. It's been difficult. We have a lot more work to do with respect to security, stability, rebuilding the infrastructure. But, we understand the challenge and we will meet the challenge as we have in the past.

QUESTION: So, Mr. Secretary, the United States, according to interviews that you gave in the recent past is taking a new responsibility, the Middle East crisis, the Palestinian and Israeli crisis, and you said that its President Bush's priority now, and the roadmap is the road to peace as outlined. Given that the Palestinian side seems to be accepting, at least the new Prime Minister, seems to be accepting the roadmap. On the Israeli side you have conditions and resistance. How far is the United States ready to go to force this peace - this road to peace - on Israel?

SECRETARY POWELL: You can't enforce something on a democratic nation. What we can do is try to create conditions where both sides see it is in their interest to come together and follow a particular path to peace. We have had very candid conversations with the Palestinian side and with the Israeli side this week. We hope that a meeting will be coming up soon between the Israeli side and the Palestinian side. Mr. Sharon will be coming to Washington in the next few days in order to discuss these issues with President Bush. And so this is the beginning of the process. There are strong feelings on both sides. What makes this situation new is that we have an elected Prime Minister of the Palestinian people, not Mr. Arafat, who was not an effective leader. He may still be seen as the leader of his country, but he did not lead his country toward peace or toward a Palestinian state. We now have a Prime Minister with authority, Abu Mazen. And President Bush has been waiting for a responsible interlocutor and Prime Minister Sharon ahs been waiting for a responsible interlocutor. So, we will find a way forward. President Bush is determined to find a way forward.

QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, you said that Yassir Arafat is not anymore a leader, that you don't consider him a leader. He is not a partner for peace. You said in previous interviews. Now, is that position of the United States shared by say President Putin? Does he agree with you that Arafat is no more somebody you can have, you can deal with?

SECRETARY POWELL: No, I would not presume to speak for President Putin And he can speak for himself . I know that he -- as we -- recognize that Yassir Arafat is the elected president of his people and his people look to him as their leader. What I was saying, what we have said previously, is that he is a failed leader, in that for all these years, that he has been the head of the PLO and the head of the Palestinian people, the leader of the Palestinian people, he has not brought them closer to peace, he has not brought them closer to their dream, which is a Palestinian state. And so we felt strongly that new leadership had to emerge and we now are seeing that new leadership emerge. Not because the United States put in that new leadership but because the Palestinian people through their legislature decided that they needed new leadership and so they created the position of Prime Minister. Not the United States. They brought forth Abu Mazen, named by Mr. Arafat and approved by the Palestinian legislature to be their Prime Minister, and to be given authority as Prime Minister to begin discussions with the Israeli side and with the American side so that we could find a way to move forward to the goal that we all have, and that's a Palestinian state living side by side in peace with Israel.

QUESTION: In Moscow, among the very influential politicians, there is a view that the Quartet, which is working in the Middle East, is a very effective way of solving complicated situations. Now, if you don't say agree on something, like the figure of Arafat, is it not going to make it one plus three instead of four?

SECRETARY POWELL: No. The Quartet agreed on the roadmap. Each member of the quartet has a different view with respect to Chairman Arafat, but the Quartet agreed on the roadmap. We are trying to use the roadmap as a way for Palestinian leaders to emerge and to represent the interests of their people. You can have more than one leader in a movement or in a government. We feel strongly that we have seen Mr. Arafat's leadership over the years. And, I personally have worked with Mr. Arafat for a year and a half before we formed the Quartet. And, frankly, he was not getting the job done or needed to move the peace process along and get closer to the day when the Palestinian people would have a state of their own. The Russian Federation has a different view. The UN, a different view. The European Union, a different view. I respect their views. But, where we found common cause, was the creation of a roadmap that shows the way forward to these two states. One state and one state to be -- the state of Israel and hopefully, a Palestinian state which will emerge -- and they can live side by side in peace. Thank you very much.

INTERVIEWER: Thank you very much.

Colin Powell,20030601,Interview with Barry Schweid and George Gedda of Associated Press,"(9:25 a.m. EDT) 
MR. SCHWEID: 9/11, an anniversary at hand again. Is America safer now, do you think, than it has been? 
SECRETARY POWELL: 9/11 was a great tragedy for our nation. It was a great tragedy for the world. I am pleased to say that we have not seen another incident, anything like 9/11. We've not been struck by terrorists since 9/11, so certainly the last three years have been an indication that we are safer. 
But we are still in a threatening environment. There are still people who want to strike the United States. As a result of the President's effort and his leadership, we have put in place a Homeland Security Department, we have tightened up our borders, we have a better idea who's coming into the country. We know how to use the information that we get to raise alert levels and take other precautions that protect our nation. 
And so, in that regard, we are safer, I believe. We are also safer in that we have eliminated the Taliban as a functioning group in Afghanistan. We have a government that is getting ready for presidential elections in Afghanistan coming up on the 9th of October. And al-Qaida no longer finds safe haven in that part of the world. Iraq has seen a dictator removed and it is no longer a source of that kind of activity, even though we still have challenges there. So, in that sense, I think we are safer. 
At the same time, the world has to continue to fight terrorism. We see terrorism in places like Beslan in Russia. We see what happened in Jakarta the other day, a bomb against the Australian Embassy. So while I think the nation clearly is safer, we have to remain vigilant and we have to realize that there are people out there who mean us ill, and they have to be fought and they have to be defeated. 
MR. SCHWEID: It's obviously a worldwide problem, but is -- many, many years ago, and she was virtually laughed at by think-tankers, Claire Sterling wrote many, many years ago about the notion of a network of terrorists, that it really is -- that they're interlocked, they're interlaced. Do you -- 
SECRETARY POWELL: Some clearly are interlocked. I mean, al-Qaida is a worldwide organization and JI is active in Asia and other parts of the world. What we want to make sure is that they don't become any more interlocked than they might be now. And that's why we focus not only just on military action and police action, but law enforcement, financial activities, getting into their information networks, their financial network, computer networks. Any means by which they might connect with one another, we are after to make sure that it doesn't become that kind of worldwide network. 
MR. SCHWEID: What are they after, besides chaos and hurting people? 
SECRETARY POWELL: They are after, first and foremost, making a statement through the destruction and killing of innocent people. And they have abandoned civilized means of making your opinion known. They reject democracy, they reject openness and they resort to the killing of innocent people. 
There can be no justification for what happened in Russia the other day, last week, where young students on the their first day of school, showing up with flowers and pencil boxes to learn, suddenly are put at risk and then are killed by the hundreds. There's no excuse for that. There can be no political justification. There is no religious justification. This is evil and terror staring us right in the face and it's the kind of evil and terror that we saw perpetrated against us three years ago on 9/11. And it must be fought. It must be resisted. There can be no compromise in this battle. 
MR. GEDDA: Bin Laden's face has not been seen on television since 2001. I don't know whether you would attach any significance to that. You have no inkling as to why almost three years have passed since he has appeared? 
SECRETARY POWELL: No, I don't know why. I don't know where he is and I don't know his state of health. I don't know. We believe he is still alive. I can't prove that. But he clearly is hiding as best he can. He is on the run. He is not popping up on television and he is not showing himself in a way that he could be captured. The whole world is after him for being a criminal and for being a terrorist and for being a murderer, so he is doing everything he can to stay hidden. 
MR. GEDDA: How much of a difference would his death or capture make? 
SECRETARY POWELL: I don't know. We have done a great deal of damage to the al-Qaida network. A large percentage of the senior leadership of al-Qaida has been killed or captured. But it does have the capacity to regenerate itself at lower levels, but they are not as accomplished and experienced as those who have been taken out. 
If he were to be taken out, would that destroy al-Qaida? I think it would be a very, very serious blow against al-Qaida. I cannot tell you, though, that there would not be others who would try to take his place. But the top leadership of al-Qaida has been very badly damaged through capture and death over the last three years. 
MR. GEDDA: You mentioned Russia. They have taken exception to some things that have been said from this building. Mr. Lavrov said, ""We solve our internal problems ourselves and there's no need to search for an American route to political normalization in Chechnya."" 
SECRETARY POWELL: Well, we didn't suggest any American route to political normalization of Chechnya. I think the Russians are concerned that a Chechen was able to gain asylum here through our judicial system some years back, and Mr. Lavrov made a specific reference to that individual and another individual who was able, through the judicial system in the United Kingdom, to gain asylum. But that's part of our judicial system. 
We are fully united and standing alongside the Russians as they deal with the terrorist threat that they face and the terrorist strike that was perpetrated against their innocent citizens last week. And that's what they also heard clearly enunciated by the State Department and there's no confusion here. 
How this problem of Chechnya will ultimately be solved is something for the Russians to work out, but with respect to terrorist attacks against innocent Russians, we stand united with the Russians that they have to deal with this in the most powerful, direct, forceful way that they can in order to protect their citizens, the same as we are doing to protect our citizens. 
MR. SCHWEID: Do we know yet who was involved, whether it was Chechen, all Chechen, al-Qaida? 
SECRETARY POWELL: No, I don't, and that's something we really should let the Russians determine and make appropriate announcements about. 
MR. SCHWEID: Can I ask you about Korea? The South Korean -- the disclosures about South Korean experiments and even traces of plutonium from 20 years ago. Is this going to make your job of getting North Korea to cooperate even harder? 
SECRETARY POWELL: Well, I think the North Koreans will seize on it, they have seized on it, but it's pretty obvious that these were not significant events. One took place 20 years ago of an experimental nature, the one dealing with plutonium. The one dealing with uranium happened about four years ago. But it's quite clear that these were not intended other than for academic, experimental purposes, and it's over with and I think that's, frankly, the end of the matter. I don't see any great significance to them, but the North Koreans always like to seize on anything to make their point. 
MR. SCHWEID: You still haven't -- not that you actually have to announce a date this early in September, but we don't hear a date for the resumption. 
SECRETARY POWELL: We don't have a date yet. Assistant Secretary Kelly is in the region consulting with our friends in the region, and we will see whether a date emerges from these consultations. 
We have laid out a very strong position, a very flexible position, a position that makes it clear we have no intention of invading or attacking North Korea, we have no hostile intent. But we do insist, as do the other members of the six-party group that we have put together, we do insist that we move toward the denuclearization of the peninsula in a very, very complete and verifiable way. 
The North Koreans understand that this has to be the case, and the Japanese and South Koreans have offered initial incentives in the form of energy assistance to the North Koreans to get started on this process. We are interested in participating in the writing of a security agreement that the North Koreans can see as evidence of our policy and we are waiting for the North Koreans to respond to this. North Korea is a country in need. The President has, many times, expressed his concern about the North Korean people. And, hopefully, the North Koreans will understand that there is no point in waiting or stretching this out; let's get started. 
MR. GEDDA: Iraq question. You talked to the Saudis, I don't know, six weeks ago, about their idea for a Muslim security force for Iraq. Where does that stand now? 
SECRETARY POWELL: I haven't had any recent conversations with the Saudi Foreign Minister about it. I know that they have continued to consult with different Muslim countries, but I haven't talked to him recently about what progress he has made. 
MR. GEDDA: You were enthusiastic about the Future of Iraq project two years ago. Almost nothing has been heard about it since then, and -- but you praised it at the time, you thought it was a good idea for the postwar reconstruction. 
I hear it's gathering dust, the outcome of this. Are you disappointed in that it never seemed to be acted upon after the war? 
SECRETARY POWELL: Well, the Future of Iraq study was a one-year effort led by the State Department, but it was an interagency effort. And we also brought in outsiders from think tanks, from universities and elsewhere, and it was a very good piece of work. It was made available to the Coalition Provisional Authority. It was made available to Mr. Jay Garner, General Jay Garner, before that. Parts of it have been used and that body of information is here. We're using it. 
As you know, we have an office within our Near Eastern Bureau that is working closely with Ambassador Negroponte and many of the people in that office worked on the Future of Iraq study. So it still gives us insight as to things that have to be done with respect to reconstruction, with respect to the political process, and materials are available, both to the office here as well as to Ambassador Negroponte. 
MR. SCHWEID: In Israel, the Foreign Minister is speaking of the time may be growing near to exile Arafat. I suppose that's an Israeli decision. But would that, in any way, help the situation? 
SECRETARY POWELL: Well, I haven't heard that particular report. From time to time, you receive -- you hear statements from Israeli authorities as to what the future of Mr. Arafat should be or not be, and other statements come along a few days later. So I don't have any comment at this point. I hadn't heard about it. 
MR. SCHWEID: Okay. Is there time left for you to have any impact on the stalemate, do you think? 
SECRETARY POWELL: I and members of my Department and the President have stood ready, and members of the National Security Council have stood ready, to engage with the Israelis and the Palestinians at any time such an engagement would be appropriate and would make sense. We're working with the Israelis on the Gaza disengagement plan and the four settlements that would also be removed from the West Bank and other aspects of their settlement policy. 
But what we need and what we don't have and what we have been struggling to obtain for the last year, since the President took the bold step of going to Aqaba and endorsing the roadmap and having everyone else endorse the roadmap, is the reform that's needed in the Palestinian Authority. We need to see the end of terror. We need to see the consolidation of Palestinian security forces under responsible leadership. 
We need to have an empowered prime minister, and that requires taking authority and power away from Mr. Arafat and empowering a prime minister so he could act as head of government and get on with the process of reforming the administration of the Palestinian Authority, putting in place a solid security organization and getting ready for the Gaza disengagement. 
MR. SCHWEID: That would seem to be part of any settlement -- necessary for any settlement. But is it necessary in order -- is it a prerequisite for the U.S. launching another drive? In other words, can you -- I know you're working on it -- but can you step up the drive even when the Palestinians are resisting? 
SECRETARY POWELL: We've stepped up the drive repeatedly. We've stepped up the drive at the beginning of this Administration with the Mitchell Plan, the Tenet Plan, the Zinni Plan, multiple trips. In June of 2002, the President laid out a strong vision for a Palestinian state in a way that no president has done previously, but the President noted we needed a partner to work on this, and the partner had to be somebody besides Yasser Arafat. 
We needed an empowered prime minister. We thought that we had made progress with that last year when the President went to Aqaba. And, frankly, most of that was undercut by Mr. Arafat. And so it's difficult to see how progress can be made without an empowered prime minister of the Palestinian Authority. But we stand ready. We are in touch with the parties. Assistant Secretary Burns goes there frequently. I am in touch with both sides on a regular basis. But we need to see -- we need to see movement. We just can't go moving back and forth, working with the same arrangement that has failed so many times in the past. 
A good friend of mine, who worked on this for 12 years, Mr. Dennis Ross, has just written a book that makes the same point, that Mr. Arafat is not acting as a responsible partner for peace. And it is in the interest of the Palestinian people not to eliminate Mr. Arafat, but to empower a prime minister who can be a responsible partner for peace. 
MR. SCHWEID: Yeah, he and Albright are going to hold forth on this subject at noon, by the way. 
A quick question: Can the U.S. have good relations with Venezuela under Chavez? Is it possible? 
SECRETARY POWELL: Well, we will have to see. We have concerns about some of the actions that President Chavez has taken over the years in pursuit of his vision of Bolivarian democracy. We want the Venezuelan people to do well. We are friends to the Venezuelan people. And now that the election, or the referendum, is over, we will just have to see how things develop. 
MR. SCHWEID: Toward the end of an interview, there is always a bit of a hooker, but I hope you won't take it that way. Four years are drawing to a close. Have you felt that you had a role that was, as a lot of people see you as having, of being a moderating influence in an otherwise far more conservative, far more aggressive -- I can pick the words without looking for a word that isn't terribly charged -- but I think you know what my point is. 
I talk to so many people who speak favorably, very favorably of you, and thank heavens that you're there, but they speak in terms of you having a stabilizing interest: going to the UN on Iraq and so many instances and positions you've taken on family planning, on, you know, quotas, on this affirmative action. Do you -- it's an awkward question, but I wonder if you want to deal with it at this point. 
SECRETARY POWELL: Well, I have been given many labels in the course of my career and over the past four years. The only label that really sticks and is important is that I serve this nation and I serve the President. And my job is to help the President carry out his foreign policy objectives as he determines them to be. 
And I believe he appreciates the advice I give. We have done a lot that, perhaps, doesn't get enough attention: the creation of the Millennium Challenge Corporation; the HIV/AIDS initiative; we were playing a -- played an instrumental role in creating the best relationship we've had with China in decades; a good relationship with Russia; expansion of NATO; working with the European Union to expand it and to work with the European Union to the point where it can take over some responsibilities from NATO in Europe. 
I think we played a very instrumental role in helping the Indians and Pakistanis to begin talking to one another again. We have excellent relations with both of those countries and that's not where we started out a few years ago. 
We have done a great deal with respect to free trade, open trade, expansion of the African Growth and Opportunity Act, expansion of regional trade agreements here, WTO accession. So I think we've done a great deal that is positive. 
And we also did some things that people view as controversial, but I think they are positive. Two despotic regimes are gone, the one that was in Kabul and the one that was in Baghdad, and the world is better off for their departure, and their nations are better off for the departure of these two regimes. 
We have challenging times ahead of us in order to consolidate our success there, to get rid of the insurgents both in Iraq and Afghanistan. But, in a few weeks' time, 20-odd million Afghans will have the opportunity of picking a new president in a democratic election. Imagine that, from just three years ago when the Taliban was in charge. And we are trying to accomplish the same mission for the people of Iraq, 25 million people in Iraq. 
And the people who are trying to stop it -- stop the Iraqis, stop the Iraqi Government -- are left over from the past. They're terrorists, former regime elements that want to take Iraq back into the days of Saddam Hussein. And we will not let that happen. But, more importantly, I don't think the Iraqi people will let it happen. And so we're building up Iraqi forces to deal with that challenge just as we're building up Afghan forces to deal with the insurgency that still is, to an extent, slowing down the work in Afghanistan. 
And guess what. People are turning out. They want to be part of this force. They want their country to move forward in this way. They don't want ex-Taliban or remnants of the Taliban or remnants of the former regime in Iraq to stop their progress. 
MR. GEDDA: The President said in Philadelphia the other day he'd be happy to have you around beyond January 20th, assuming he's reelected. Do you have any reaction to that? 
SECRETARY POWELL: Well, the President and I have a very strong, solid relationship and I'm pleased he would say such a thing, but you know my standard answer to this question: I serve at the pleasure. 
MR. GEDDA: Well, it seems like it is his pleasure. 
SECRETARY POWELL: Time will tell. We will see. There's no -- I don't serve a term. (Laughter.) 
MR. GEDDA: How are we doing? One more? 
MR. SCHWEID: One more quick one. Is there an area -- it would be the case, I suppose, with everybody -- is there an area -- you've dealt now heavily with what's going on in Sudan. Is there an area, is there an issue, is there a subject, in retrospect, you wished you had more time to focus on, perhaps couldn't because of other events? But is there -- the world ""regret"" comes to mind. I don't quite mean it that way. But is there something you wish you had had a little more time to deal with? 
SECRETARY POWELL: Well, I still have time, Barry. (Laughter.) 
MR. SCHWEID: Well, I know. We're not saying goodbye. We're not saying goodbye.SECRETARY POWELL: Look, we have done so many things. What I've found in this job is that thereis no area you can ignore. It all comes to my office. And so some days it will be a major issue like Iraq or Sudan. The next day, it might just be flying to Greenland to sign a modest agreement or going to a Panamanian inauguration to show support for Panama. Not momentous actions on any grand scale, but part of the job of being Secretary of State. 
So there is no issue I can't get involved in and I do get involved in. And the style that I have and the way the Department runs is, if it's somebody else's problem, then it's our problem. If somebody brings a problem to us because the United States can help with it, then we have a responsibility to help with it. 
And we've been successful in a number of areas. We've dealt with Libya and disarmed it from its weapons of mass destruction. We played a very important role in Liberia, in helping it get rid of Charles Taylor. We did the same thing in Haiti, and now we are working to build up the UN force in Haiti so that the Haitian people have a better shot at a brighter future. 
And so, sure, I always wish I had more time for the whole agenda, but we ignore no part of our agenda. 
MR. SCHWEID: Thank you. 
MR. GEDDA: Thanks. Appreciate it.

MR. SCHWEID: 9/11, an anniversary at hand again. Is America safer now, do you think, than it has been?

SECRETARY POWELL: 9/11 was a great tragedy for our nation. It was a great tragedy for the world. I am pleased to say that we have not seen another incident, anything like 9/11. We've not been struck by terrorists since 9/11, so certainly the last three years have been an indication that we are safer.

But we are still in a threatening environment. There are still people who want to strike the United States. As a result of the President's effort and his leadership, we have put in place a Homeland Security Department, we have tightened up our borders, we have a better idea who's coming into the country. We know how to use the information that we get to raise alert levels and take other precautions that protect our nation.

And so, in that regard, we are safer, I believe. We are also safer in that we have eliminated the Taliban as a functioning group in Afghanistan. We have a government that is getting ready for presidential elections in Afghanistan coming up on the 9th of October. And al-Qaida no longer finds safe haven in that part of the world. Iraq has seen a dictator removed and it is no longer a source of that kind of activity, even though we still have challenges there. So, in that sense, I think we are safer.

At the same time, the world has to continue to fight terrorism. We see terrorism in places like Beslan in Russia. We see what happened in Jakarta the other day, a bomb against the Australian Embassy. So while I think the nation clearly is safer, we have to remain vigilant and we have to realize that there are people out there who mean us ill, and they have to be fought and they have to be defeated.

MR. SCHWEID: It's obviously a worldwide problem, but is -- many, many years ago, and she was virtually laughed at by think-tankers, Claire Sterling wrote many, many years ago about the notion of a network of terrorists, that it really is -- that they're interlocked, they're interlaced. Do you --

SECRETARY POWELL: Some clearly are interlocked. I mean, al-Qaida is a worldwide organization and JI is active in Asia and other parts of the world. What we want to make sure is that they don't become any more interlocked than they might be now. And that's why we focus not only just on military action and police action, but law enforcement, financial activities, getting into their information networks, their financial network, computer networks. Any means by which they might connect with one another, we are after to make sure that it doesn't become that kind of worldwide network.

MR. SCHWEID: What are they after, besides chaos and hurting people?

SECRETARY POWELL: They are after, first and foremost, making a statement through the destruction and killing of innocent people. And they have abandoned civilized means of making your opinion known. They reject democracy, they reject openness and they resort to the killing of innocent people.

There can be no justification for what happened in Russia the other day, last week, where young students on the their first day of school, showing up with flowers and pencil boxes to learn, suddenly are put at risk and then are killed by the hundreds. There's no excuse for that. There can be no political justification. There is no religious justification. This is evil and terror staring us right in the face and it's the kind of evil and terror that we saw perpetrated against us three years ago on 9/11. And it must be fought. It must be resisted. There can be no compromise in this battle.

MR. GEDDA: Bin Laden's face has not been seen on television since 2001. I don't know whether you would attach any significance to that. You have no inkling as to why almost three years have passed since he has appeared?

SECRETARY POWELL: No, I don't know why. I don't know where he is and I don't know his state of health. I don't know. We believe he is still alive. I can't prove that. But he clearly is hiding as best he can. He is on the run. He is not popping up on television and he is not showing himself in a way that he could be captured. The whole world is after him for being a criminal and for being a terrorist and for being a murderer, so he is doing everything he can to stay hidden.

MR. GEDDA: How much of a difference would his death or capture make?

SECRETARY POWELL: I don't know. We have done a great deal of damage to the al-Qaida network. A large percentage of the senior leadership of al-Qaida has been killed or captured. But it does have the capacity to regenerate itself at lower levels, but they are not as accomplished and experienced as those who have been taken out.

If he were to be taken out, would that destroy al-Qaida? I think it would be a very, very serious blow against al-Qaida. I cannot tell you, though, that there would not be others who would try to take his place. But the top leadership of al-Qaida has been very badly damaged through capture and death over the last three years.

MR. GEDDA: You mentioned Russia. They have taken exception to some things that have been said from this building. Mr. Lavrov said, ""We solve our internal problems ourselves and there's no need to search for an American route to political normalization in Chechnya.""

SECRETARY POWELL: Well, we didn't suggest any American route to political normalization of Chechnya. I think the Russians are concerned that a Chechen was able to gain asylum here through our judicial system some years back, and Mr. Lavrov made a specific reference to that individual and another individual who was able, through the judicial system in the United Kingdom, to gain asylum. But that's part of our judicial system.

We are fully united and standing alongside the Russians as they deal with the terrorist threat that they face and the terrorist strike that was perpetrated against their innocent citizens last week. And that's what they also heard clearly enunciated by the State Department and there's no confusion here.

How this problem of Chechnya will ultimately be solved is something for the Russians to work out, but with respect to terrorist attacks against innocent Russians, we stand united with the Russians that they have to deal with this in the most powerful, direct, forceful way that they can in order to protect their citizens, the same as we are doing to protect our citizens.

MR. SCHWEID: Do we know yet who was involved, whether it was Chechen, all Chechen, al-Qaida?

SECRETARY POWELL: No, I don't, and that's something we really should let the Russians determine and make appropriate announcements about.

MR. SCHWEID: Can I ask you about Korea? The South Korean -- the disclosures about South Korean experiments and even traces of plutonium from 20 years ago. Is this going to make your job of getting North Korea to cooperate even harder?

SECRETARY POWELL: Well, I think the North Koreans will seize on it, they have seized on it, but it's pretty obvious that these were not significant events. One took place 20 years ago of an experimental nature, the one dealing with plutonium. The one dealing with uranium happened about four years ago. But it's quite clear that these were not intended other than for academic, experimental purposes, and it's over with and I think that's, frankly, the end of the matter. I don't see any great significance to them, but the North Koreans always like to seize on anything to make their point.

MR. SCHWEID: You still haven't -- not that you actually have to announce a date this early in September, but we don't hear a date for the resumption.

SECRETARY POWELL: We don't have a date yet. Assistant Secretary Kelly is in the region consulting with our friends in the region, and we will see whether a date emerges from these consultations.

We have laid out a very strong position, a very flexible position, a position that makes it clear we have no intention of invading or attacking North Korea, we have no hostile intent. But we do insist, as do the other members of the six-party group that we have put together, we do insist that we move toward the denuclearization of the peninsula in a very, very complete and verifiable way.

The North Koreans understand that this has to be the case, and the Japanese and South Koreans have offered initial incentives in the form of energy assistance to the North Koreans to get started on this process. We are interested in participating in the writing of a security agreement that the North Koreans can see as evidence of our policy and we are waiting for the North Koreans to respond to this. North Korea is a country in need. The President has, many times, expressed his concern about the North Korean people. And, hopefully, the North Koreans will understand that there is no point in waiting or stretching this out; let's get started.

MR. GEDDA: Iraq question. You talked to the Saudis, I don't know, six weeks ago, about their idea for a Muslim security force for Iraq. Where does that stand now?

SECRETARY POWELL: I haven't had any recent conversations with the Saudi Foreign Minister about it. I know that they have continued to consult with different Muslim countries, but I haven't talked to him recently about what progress he has made.

MR. GEDDA: You were enthusiastic about the Future of Iraq project two years ago. Almost nothing has been heard about it since then, and -- but you praised it at the time, you thought it was a good idea for the postwar reconstruction.

I hear it's gathering dust, the outcome of this. Are you disappointed in that it never seemed to be acted upon after the war?

SECRETARY POWELL: Well, the Future of Iraq study was a one-year effort led by the State Department, but it was an interagency effort. And we also brought in outsiders from think tanks, from universities and elsewhere, and it was a very good piece of work. It was made available to the Coalition Provisional Authority. It was made available to Mr. Jay Garner, General Jay Garner, before that. Parts of it have been used and that body of information is here. We're using it.

As you know, we have an office within our Near Eastern Bureau that is working closely with Ambassador Negroponte and many of the people in that office worked on the Future of Iraq study. So it still gives us insight as to things that have to be done with respect to reconstruction, with respect to the political process, and materials are available, both to the office here as well as to Ambassador Negroponte.

MR. SCHWEID: In Israel, the Foreign Minister is speaking of the time may be growing near to exile Arafat. I suppose that's an Israeli decision. But would that, in any way, help the situation?

SECRETARY POWELL: Well, I haven't heard that particular report. From time to time, you receive -- you hear statements from Israeli authorities as to what the future of Mr. Arafat should be or not be, and other statements come along a few days later. So I don't have any comment at this point. I hadn't heard about it.

MR. SCHWEID: Okay. Is there time left for you to have any impact on the stalemate, do you think?

SECRETARY POWELL: I and members of my Department and the President have stood ready, and members of the National Security Council have stood ready, to engage with the Israelis and the Palestinians at any time such an engagement would be appropriate and would make sense. We're working with the Israelis on the Gaza disengagement plan and the four settlements that would also be removed from the West Bank and other aspects of their settlement policy.

But what we need and what we don't have and what we have been struggling to obtain for the last year, since the President took the bold step of going to Aqaba and endorsing the roadmap and having everyone else endorse the roadmap, is the reform that's needed in the Palestinian Authority. We need to see the end of terror. We need to see the consolidation of Palestinian security forces under responsible leadership.

We need to have an empowered prime minister, and that requires taking authority and power away from Mr. Arafat and empowering a prime minister so he could act as head of government and get on with the process of reforming the administration of the Palestinian Authority, putting in place a solid security organization and getting ready for the Gaza disengagement.

MR. SCHWEID: That would seem to be part of any settlement -- necessary for any settlement. But is it necessary in order -- is it a prerequisite for the U.S. launching another drive? In other words, can you -- I know you're working on it -- but can you step up the drive even when the Palestinians are resisting?

SECRETARY POWELL: We've stepped up the drive repeatedly. We've stepped up the drive at the beginning of this Administration with the Mitchell Plan, the Tenet Plan, the Zinni Plan, multiple trips. In June of 2002, the President laid out a strong vision for a Palestinian state in a way that no president has done previously, but the President noted we needed a partner to work on this, and the partner had to be somebody besides Yasser Arafat.

We needed an empowered prime minister. We thought that we had made progress with that last year when the President went to Aqaba. And, frankly, most of that was undercut by Mr. Arafat. And so it's difficult to see how progress can be made without an empowered prime minister of the Palestinian Authority. But we stand ready. We are in touch with the parties. Assistant Secretary Burns goes there frequently. I am in touch with both sides on a regular basis. But we need to see -- we need to see movement. We just can't go moving back and forth, working with the same arrangement that has failed so many times in the past.

A good friend of mine, who worked on this for 12 years, Mr. Dennis Ross, has just written a book that makes the same point, that Mr. Arafat is not acting as a responsible partner for peace. And it is in the interest of the Palestinian people not to eliminate Mr. Arafat, but to empower a prime minister who can be a responsible partner for peace.

MR. SCHWEID: Yeah, he and Albright are going to hold forth on this subject at noon, by the way.

A quick question: Can the U.S. have good relations with Venezuela under Chavez? Is it possible?

SECRETARY POWELL: Well, we will have to see. We have concerns about some of the actions that President Chavez has taken over the years in pursuit of his vision of Bolivarian democracy. We want the Venezuelan people to do well. We are friends to the Venezuelan people. And now that the election, or the referendum, is over, we will just have to see how things develop.

MR. SCHWEID: Toward the end of an interview, there is always a bit of a hooker, but I hope you won't take it that way. Four years are drawing to a close. Have you felt that you had a role that was, as a lot of people see you as having, of being a moderating influence in an otherwise far more conservative, far more aggressive -- I can pick the words without looking for a word that isn't terribly charged -- but I think you know what my point is.

I talk to so many people who speak favorably, very favorably of you, and thank heavens that you're there, but they speak in terms of you having a stabilizing interest: going to the UN on Iraq and so many instances and positions you've taken on family planning, on, you know, quotas, on this affirmative action. Do you -- it's an awkward question, but I wonder if you want to deal with it at this point.

SECRETARY POWELL: Well, I have been given many labels in the course of my career and over the past four years. The only label that really sticks and is important is that I serve this nation and I serve the President. And my job is to help the President carry out his foreign policy objectives as he determines them to be.

And I believe he appreciates the advice I give. We have done a lot that, perhaps, doesn't get enough attention: the creation of the Millennium Challenge Corporation; the HIV/AIDS initiative; we were playing a -- played an instrumental role in creating the best relationship we've had with China in decades; a good relationship with Russia; expansion of NATO; working with the European Union to expand it and to work with the European Union to the point where it can take over some responsibilities from NATO in Europe.

I think we played a very instrumental role in helping the Indians and Pakistanis to begin talking to one another again. We have excellent relations with both of those countries and that's not where we started out a few years ago.

We have done a great deal with respect to free trade, open trade, expansion of the African Growth and Opportunity Act, expansion of regional trade agreements here, WTO accession. So I think we've done a great deal that is positive.

And we also did some things that people view as controversial, but I think they are positive. Two despotic regimes are gone, the one that was in Kabul and the one that was in Baghdad, and the world is better off for their departure, and their nations are better off for the departure of these two regimes.

We have challenging times ahead of us in order to consolidate our success there, to get rid of the insurgents both in Iraq and Afghanistan. But, in a few weeks' time, 20-odd million Afghans will have the opportunity of picking a new president in a democratic election. Imagine that, from just three years ago when the Taliban was in charge. And we are trying to accomplish the same mission for the people of Iraq, 25 million people in Iraq.

And the people who are trying to stop it -- stop the Iraqis, stop the Iraqi Government -- are left over from the past. They're terrorists, former regime elements that want to take Iraq back into the days of Saddam Hussein. And we will not let that happen. But, more importantly, I don't think the Iraqi people will let it happen. And so we're building up Iraqi forces to deal with that challenge just as we're building up Afghan forces to deal with the insurgency that still is, to an extent, slowing down the work in Afghanistan.

And guess what. People are turning out. They want to be part of this force. They want their country to move forward in this way. They don't want ex-Taliban or remnants of the Taliban or remnants of the former regime in Iraq to stop their progress.

MR. GEDDA: The President said in Philadelphia the other day he'd be happy to have you around beyond January 20th, assuming he's reelected. Do you have any reaction to that?

SECRETARY POWELL: Well, the President and I have a very strong, solid relationship and I'm pleased he would say such a thing, but you know my standard answer to this question: I serve at the pleasure.

MR. GEDDA: Well, it seems like it is his pleasure.

SECRETARY POWELL: Time will tell. We will see. There's no -- I don't serve a term. (Laughter.)

MR. GEDDA: How are we doing? One more?

MR. SCHWEID: One more quick one. Is there an area -- it would be the case, I suppose, with everybody -- is there an area -- you've dealt now heavily with what's going on in Sudan. Is there an area, is there an issue, is there a subject, in retrospect, you wished you had more time to focus on, perhaps couldn't because of other events? But is there -- the world ""regret"" comes to mind. I don't quite mean it that way. But is there something you wish you had had a little more time to deal with?

SECRETARY POWELL: Well, I still have time, Barry. (Laughter.)

MR. SCHWEID: Well, I know. We're not saying goodbye. We're not saying goodbye.SECRETARY POWELL: Look, we have done so many things. What I've found in this job is that thereis no area you can ignore. It all comes to my office. And so some days it will be a major issue like Iraq or Sudan. The next day, it might just be flying to Greenland to sign a modest agreement or going to a Panamanian inauguration to show support for Panama. Not momentous actions on any grand scale, but part of the job of being Secretary of State.

So there is no issue I can't get involved in and I do get involved in. And the style that I have and the way the Department runs is, if it's somebody else's problem, then it's our problem. If somebody brings a problem to us because the United States can help with it, then we have a responsibility to help with it.

And we've been successful in a number of areas. We've dealt with Libya and disarmed it from its weapons of mass destruction. We played a very important role in Liberia, in helping it get rid of Charles Taylor. We did the same thing in Haiti, and now we are working to build up the UN force in Haiti so that the Haitian people have a better shot at a brighter future.

And so, sure, I always wish I had more time for the whole agenda, but we ignore no part of our agenda.

MR. SCHWEID: Thank you.

MR. GEDDA: Thanks. Appreciate it.

Colin Powell,20020126,Interview on TV6,"QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, what is your view of the role and the actions of Russia during the current situation in Afghanistan and around Afghanistan?
SECRETARY POWELL: I think Russia has played a very positive role since the events of the 11th of September. We are very pleased at the immediate support that President Putin gave to us. He was the first world leader to call Mr. Bush and that meant a lot to the American people. The Russian people and the Russian government have been working very closely with us and with the international coalition to bring all the pressure to bear that we can against the terrorists of the September 11th incident, those who were responsible for the September 11th incident, and in the campaign against terrorism in general. Russia has suffered from terrorist acts and understands that this is a campaign that the whole of Russia should be aligned in.
QUESTION: Could you tell us what disagreements exist in the approaches to the Afghan problem between Russia and the United States?
SECRETARY POWELL: I dont know of any. Foreign Minister Ivanov and I speak several times a week on the issue. They have been very supportive of our efforts in the United Nations. We have coordinated very, very closely. We have coordinated as we tried to get the political process started in Bonn and both governments are supporting the interim administration that will be heading to Kabul shortly and we have worked together as Russia sent in some of its units to reestablish your embassy and also to put into place a humanitarian operation which is doing wonderful work. In all of that we have coordinated closely with each other.
QUESTION: Mr. Powell, could you tell us if there were any changes and, if so, what changes have occurred in the attitude of the US administration toward the actions of the Russian government in Chechnya since September 11th?
SECRETARY POWELL: We noted with great interest President Putins speech several weeks after September 11th when he aligned himself in the campaign against terrorism and also spoke about his desires to reach a political settlement in Chechnya. We welcomed that statement on his side, his statement. We have said to our Russian colleagues that we understand that they have a situation, a problem they have to deal with. There are terrorists in Chechnya and we understand that, but they have to use restraint to try to find a political solution and be very, very considerate of human rights of people and make sure they look aggressively into any instances where human rights may have been violated in the prosecution of this crisis.
QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, could you tell us how the current cases, the current events, in which the Russian government more and more often tries to suppress the media, specifically they are trying to do that to TV-6, this TV company that I represent. How would they affect the Russian-US relations?
SECRETARY POWELL: I cant speak to the specifics of your station, either on the business side or the political side, but just let me say that we have always said to our Russian colleagues that an independent media is an essential component of a democratic system. The media must be free to gather information and must be free to criticize every element of the society. It can be very uncomfortable at times - believe me I know - but this is one of the essential features of democracy: a free and independent media that is a check on all elements of society. Our two presidents discussed this at every one of their meetings and after the Washington-Crawford meetings President Bush offered to send a group of media experts over to discuss these matters with the Russian government and the media people in Russia.
QUESTION: And are you going to raise this issue during this current visit?
SECRETARY POWELL: I always raise it in my discussions with Foreign Minister Ivanov and Im sure it will come up in my discussions with President Putin.
QUESTION: Thank you, Mister Secretary, for your [inaudible].

Colin Powell,20030501,Press Conference with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov,"(As Translated)FOREIGN MINISTER IVANOV: Ladies and Gentleman, we are glad to welcome you and would like to say to you some comments, some comments following the meeting of the President of the Russian Federation and the Secretary of State of the United States. Although this has not been a lengthy meeting, nevertheless a broad range of issues have been discussed including bilateral agenda and many international problems. The discussion has been open, frank and constructive and the leitmotif of the whole discussion boils down to the statement that Russia and the United States must continue to go to pursue this path of true partnership between the two countries. And despite the difficulties and differences that we have had in the recent path concerning Iraq I must tell you that the basic foundation of our partnership relations have survived this test, have passed this test and we reaffirmed our desire and our intention to continue further development and strengthening of our partnership both on a bi-lateral basis and an international format. Very soon there will be a summit meeting between our two presidents in St. Petersburg and we are confident that this forthcoming meeting will provide a new impetus to the further development of our bi-lateral relations in all the areas and first of all in the area of strengthening security. Thank you. 
SECRETARY POWELL: Thank you very much, Mr. Minister. It was a great pleasure to be back in the Russian Federation and to have had the opportunity to meet with you and with President Putin. I am especially pleased and honored to be here on the day that the Duma voted to ratify the treaty that was entered into last year here in Moscow, which we refer to as the Treaty of Moscow, which provides for the reduction of arsenals of nuclear weapons. I certainly agree with the Ministers assessment that my meeting with President Putin was very open and candid and to the point. We talked about some of the difficulties weve had in the recent past with respect to Iraq. But we also spoke about the successes we have had with respect to the Treaty of Moscow, and to the strength of our bi-lateral relationship with delegations going back and forth, and the closest contact between our ministries and we too are looking forward to the meeting of our Presidents in St. Petersburg in just a couple of weeks time. With respect to Iraq, Minister Ivanov and I will be working closely in the days ahead on the resolution that is pending before the United Nations to see if we can come into agreement with our other security council partners in passing a resolution that we will use to help the people of Iraq build a better life for themselves and for their children. Thank you very much Mr. Minister. 
QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, do the positive statements on Iraq mean the United States and Russia now agree there should be an unambiguous lifting of sanctions, unconditional lifting of sanctions on Iraq? On Iran, there was no mention of technology transfers which has bothered the United States, and Mr. Minister, do you think the U.S. now has an understanding of what is going on in Chechnya with the rebellion it is up against?
SECRETARY POWELL: I counted 3 or 4 questions. (laughter) What was the question? With respect to Iraq, we have described our position to each other. There are some outstanding issues and we will be working on these issues in the spirit of partnership in trying to come to a solution. But I wouldnt pre-judge any particular outcome at this point. With respect to Iran we had a full discussion of our mutual concerns concerning nuclear programs, nuclear developments in Iran and I think we have a better understanding of one anothers concerns and weve come a little closer as to how we should deal with our concerns. 
FOREIGN MINISTER IVANOV: As I mentioned at the beginning, we discussed a broad range of issues both international issues and bi-lateral issues. Naturally, we didnt dwell on all of them, but nevertheless a broad range of issues have been covered including the situation in the Middle East, Afghanistan, the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and some other international issues. As regards Iraq, we decided not to focus on our past disagreements but rather to try and find common ground and achieve mutual understanding, including the matter of adopting a new resolution at the Security Council in order to unite the efforts of the entire international community and to unite the Iraqi people. And we will continue our consultations both with our American partners and with other members of the United Nations Security Council. As regards Chechnya, President Putin expressed his gratitude to the State Department of the United States for their statement, a clear-cut and firm statement condemning the recent terrorist acts in Chechnya. And these terrorists acts that have taken place recently in Saudi Arabia and in Chechnya once again demonstrate the need for pooling the efforts of the entire international community in order to counter the terrorist activities throughout the world. At the same time, let me assure you that these terrorist acts will not impede the efforts of the Russian Government in order to find a political resolution, a political settlement, of the situation in Chechnya and all the plans that we have for political settlement and resolution of the problem will be implemented. 
QUESTION: There have been reports that there have been some problems with a new United Nations Security Council resolution on Iraq, how serious are those differences and could Russia again take a similarly hard position, firm position, as it took previously when previous resolutions were discussed. 
FOREIGN MINISTER IVANOV: Now the discussions are underway on specific questions, specific issues concerning this resolution and therefore I would prefer not to single out any of those issues. The main thing now is to create a legal basis for a broad international involvement in post-war rehabilitation of the country. And this is our objective. We do not seek to somehow to complicate the resolution or somehow to create artificial barriers standing in the way of adopting a common resolution. We must find together a way out and we must find ways and means to help the Iraqi people to build a new peaceful life. And this is the concrete objective that we pursue. And we, it is our intention to continue to work along these lines in a constructive spirit. 
QUESTION: Nicholas Kralev, Washington Times: President Putin said here minutes or hours ago that the differences between you have been successfully overcome. Does that mean that, Mr. Secretary, that at some point in the process you envision a role for UNMOVIC, and that the inspectors would return to Iraq? (In Russian): Mr. Minister, is Russia prepared to recognize the leading role of the coalition in governing Iraq?
SECRETARY POWELL: I think what the President was referring to a little earlier was that the difference of agreement we had with respect to the use of force and the second resolution, that is now behind us. And as we engage on this new resolution there are many issues that have to be discussed within the Security Council and one of which has to do with UNMOVIC, but we didnt resolve that here today. 
FOREIGN MINISTER IVANOV: As I have already mentioned the resolution has a comprehensive nature and it touches upon many issues including the security issue. The way how those questions, those issues will be resolved is exactly something that we have been discussing today and intend to continue discussion. In any case, it is quite obvious, that Iraq will need international assistance in dealing with security issues. And I think that we need to find a solution that will help to resolve other issues as well, including humanitarian problems, economic rehabilitation of the country and some other issues related to the restoration of peaceful life in that country.

SECRETARY POWELL: Thank you very much, Mr. Minister. It was a great pleasure to be back in the Russian Federation and to have had the opportunity to meet with you and with President Putin. I am especially pleased and honored to be here on the day that the Duma voted to ratify the treaty that was entered into last year here in Moscow, which we refer to as the Treaty of Moscow, which provides for the reduction of arsenals of nuclear weapons. I certainly agree with the Ministers assessment that my meeting with President Putin was very open and candid and to the point. We talked about some of the difficulties weve had in the recent past with respect to Iraq. But we also spoke about the successes we have had with respect to the Treaty of Moscow, and to the strength of our bi-lateral relationship with delegations going back and forth, and the closest contact between our ministries and we too are looking forward to the meeting of our Presidents in St. Petersburg in just a couple of weeks time. With respect to Iraq, Minister Ivanov and I will be working closely in the days ahead on the resolution that is pending before the United Nations to see if we can come into agreement with our other security council partners in passing a resolution that we will use to help the people of Iraq build a better life for themselves and for their children. Thank you very much Mr. Minister.

QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, do the positive statements on Iraq mean the United States and Russia now agree there should be an unambiguous lifting of sanctions, unconditional lifting of sanctions on Iraq? On Iran, there was no mention of technology transfers which has bothered the United States, and Mr. Minister, do you think the U.S. now has an understanding of what is going on in Chechnya with the rebellion it is up against?

SECRETARY POWELL: I counted 3 or 4 questions. (laughter) What was the question? With respect to Iraq, we have described our position to each other. There are some outstanding issues and we will be working on these issues in the spirit of partnership in trying to come to a solution. But I wouldnt pre-judge any particular outcome at this point. With respect to Iran we had a full discussion of our mutual concerns concerning nuclear programs, nuclear developments in Iran and I think we have a better understanding of one anothers concerns and weve come a little closer as to how we should deal with our concerns.

FOREIGN MINISTER IVANOV: As I mentioned at the beginning, we discussed a broad range of issues both international issues and bi-lateral issues. Naturally, we didnt dwell on all of them, but nevertheless a broad range of issues have been covered including the situation in the Middle East, Afghanistan, the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and some other international issues. As regards Iraq, we decided not to focus on our past disagreements but rather to try and find common ground and achieve mutual understanding, including the matter of adopting a new resolution at the Security Council in order to unite the efforts of the entire international community and to unite the Iraqi people. And we will continue our consultations both with our American partners and with other members of the United Nations Security Council. As regards Chechnya, President Putin expressed his gratitude to the State Department of the United States for their statement, a clear-cut and firm statement condemning the recent terrorist acts in Chechnya. And these terrorists acts that have taken place recently in Saudi Arabia and in Chechnya once again demonstrate the need for pooling the efforts of the entire international community in order to counter the terrorist activities throughout the world. At the same time, let me assure you that these terrorist acts will not impede the efforts of the Russian Government in order to find a political resolution, a political settlement, of the situation in Chechnya and all the plans that we have for political settlement and resolution of the problem will be implemented.

QUESTION: There have been reports that there have been some problems with a new United Nations Security Council resolution on Iraq, how serious are those differences and could Russia again take a similarly hard position, firm position, as it took previously when previous resolutions were discussed.

FOREIGN MINISTER IVANOV: Now the discussions are underway on specific questions, specific issues concerning this resolution and therefore I would prefer not to single out any of those issues. The main thing now is to create a legal basis for a broad international involvement in post-war rehabilitation of the country. And this is our objective. We do not seek to somehow to complicate the resolution or somehow to create artificial barriers standing in the way of adopting a common resolution. We must find together a way out and we must find ways and means to help the Iraqi people to build a new peaceful life. And this is the concrete objective that we pursue. And we, it is our intention to continue to work along these lines in a constructive spirit.

QUESTION: Nicholas Kralev, Washington Times: President Putin said here minutes or hours ago that the differences between you have been successfully overcome. Does that mean that, Mr. Secretary, that at some point in the process you envision a role for UNMOVIC, and that the inspectors would return to Iraq? (In Russian): Mr. Minister, is Russia prepared to recognize the leading role of the coalition in governing Iraq?

SECRETARY POWELL: I think what the President was referring to a little earlier was that the difference of agreement we had with respect to the use of force and the second resolution, that is now behind us. And as we engage on this new resolution there are many issues that have to be discussed within the Security Council and one of which has to do with UNMOVIC, but we didnt resolve that here today.

FOREIGN MINISTER IVANOV: As I have already mentioned the resolution has a comprehensive nature and it touches upon many issues including the security issue. The way how those questions, those issues will be resolved is exactly something that we have been discussing today and intend to continue discussion. In any case, it is quite obvious, that Iraq will need international assistance in dealing with security issues. And I think that we need to find a solution that will help to resolve other issues as well, including humanitarian problems, economic rehabilitation of the country and some other issues related to the restoration of peaceful life in that country.

Colin Powell,20030709,Remarks to the United Nations Security Council,"[full video; accompanying slide presentations and video clips]
SECRETARY POWELL: Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President and Mr. Secretary General, distinguished colleagues, I would like to begin by expressing my thanks for the special effort that each of you made to be here today. This is an important day for us all as we review the situation with respect to Iraq and its disarmament obligations under UN Security Council Resolution 1441.
Last November 8, this Council passed Resolution 1441 by a unanimous vote. The purpose of that resolution was to disarm Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction. Iraq had already been found guilty of material breach of its obligations stretching back over 16 previous resolutions and 12 years.

Resolution 1441 was not dealing with an innocent party, but a regime this Council has repeatedly convicted over the years.
Resolution 1441 gave Iraq one last chance, one last chance to come into compliance or to face serious consequences. No Council member present and voting on that day had any illusions about the nature and intent of the resolution or what serious consequences meant if Iraq did not comply.
And to assist in its disarmament, we called on Iraq to cooperate with returning inspectors from UNMOVIC and IAEA. We laid down tough standards for Iraq to meet to allow the inspectors to do their job.

This Council placed the burden on Iraq to comply and disarm, and not on the inspectors to find that which Iraq has gone out of its way to conceal for so long. Inspectors are inspectors; they are not detectives.
I asked for this session today for two purposes. First, to support the core assessments made by Dr. Blix and Dr. ElBaradei. As Dr. Blix reported to this Council on January 27, ""Iraq appears not to have come to a genuine acceptance, not even today, of the disarmament which was demanded of it.""
And as Dr. ElBaradei reported, Iraq's declaration of December 7 ""did not provide any new information relevant to certain questions that have been outstanding since 1998.""
My second purpose today is to provide you with additional information, to share with you what the United States knows about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, as well as Iraq's involvement in terrorism, which is also the subject of Resolution 1441 and other earlier resolutions.
I might add at this point that we are providing all relevant information we can to the inspection teams for them to do their work.
The material I will present to you comes from a variety of sources. Some are U.S. sources and some are those of other countries. Some are the sources are technical, such as intercepted telephone conversations and photos taken by satellites. Other sources are people who have risked their lives to let the world know what Saddam Hussein is really up to.
I cannot tell you everything that we know, but what I can share with you, when combined with what all of us have learned over the years, is deeply troubling. What you will see is an accumulation of facts and disturbing patterns of behavior. The facts and Iraqis' behavior, Iraq's behavior, demonstrate that Saddam Hussein and his regime have made no effort, no effort, to disarm, as required by the international community.
Indeed, the facts and Iraq's behavior show that Saddam Hussein and his regime are concealing their efforts to produce more weapons of mass destruction.
Let me begin by playing a tape for you. What you’re about to hear is a conversation that my government monitored. It takes place on November 26th of last year, on the day before United Nations teams resumed inspections in Iraq. The conversation involves two senior officers, a colonel and a brigadier general from Iraq's elite military unit, the Republican Guard.
[The tape is played.] AUDIO
 
SECRETARY POWELL: Let me pause and review some of the key elements of this conversation that you just heard between these two officers.
First, they acknowledge that our colleague, Mohammed ElBaradei is coming, and they know what he's coming for and they know he's coming the next day. He's coming to look for things that are prohibited. He is expecting these gentlemen to cooperate with him and not hide things.
But they're worried. We have this modified vehicle. What do we say if one of them sees it? What is their concern? Their concern is that it's something they should not have, something that should not be seen.
The general was incredulous: ""You didn't get it modified. You don't have one of those, do you?""

""I have one.""
""Which? From where?""
""From the workshop. From the Al-Kindi Company.""
""What?""
""From Al-Kindi.""
""I'll come to see you in the morning. I'm worried you all have something left.""

""We evacuated everything. We don't have anything left.""
Note what he says: ""We evacuated everything."" We didn't destroy it. We didn't line it up for inspection. We didn't turn it into the inspectors. We evacuated it to make sure it was not around when the inspectors showed up. ""I will come to you tomorrow.""
The Al-Kindi Company. This is a company that is well known to have been involved in prohibited weapons systems activity.
Let me play another tape for you. As you will recall, the inspectors found 12 empty chemical warheads on January 16th. On January 20th, four days later, Iraq promised the inspectors it would search for more. You will now hear an officer from Republican Guard headquarters issuing an instruction to an officer in the field. Their conversation took place just last week, on January 30.
[The tape was played.] AUDIO
SECRETARY POWELL: Let me pause again and review the elements of this message.

""They are inspecting the ammunition you have, yes?""
""Yes. For the possibility there are forbidden ammo.""
""For the possibility there is, by chance, forbidden ammo?""

""Yes.
""And we sent you a message yesterday to clean out all the areas, the scrap areas, the abandoned areas. Make sure there is nothing there. Remember the first message: evacuate it.""
This is all part of a system of hiding things and moving things out of the way and making sure they have left nothing behind.

You go a little further into this message and you see the specific instructions from headquarters: ""After you have carried out what is contained in this message, destroy the message because I don't want anyone to see this message.""
""Okay.""
""Okay.""
Why? Why? This message would have verified to the inspectors that they have been trying to turn over things. They were looking for things, but they don't want that message seen because they were trying to clean up the area, to leave no evidence behind of the presence of weapons of mass destruction. And they can claim that nothing was there and the inspectors can look all they want and they will find nothing.
This effort to hide things from the inspectors is not one or two isolated events. Quite the contrary, this is part and parcel of a policy of evasion and deception that goes back 12 years, a policy set at the highest levels of the Iraqi regime.
We know that Saddam Hussein has what is called ""a Higher Committee for Monitoring the Inspection Teams."" Think about that. Iraq has a high-level committee to monitor the inspectors who were sent in to monitor Iraq's disarmament -- not to cooperate with them, not to assist them, but to spy on them and keep them from doing their jobs.
The committee reports directly to Saddam Hussein. It is headed by Iraq's Vice President, Taha Yasin Ramadan. Its members include Saddam Hussein's son, Qusay.
This committee also includes Lieutenant General Amir al-Sa'di, an advisor to Saddam. In case that name isn't immediately familiar to you, General Sa'di has been the Iraqi regime's primary point of contact for Dr. Blix and Dr. ElBaradei. It was General Sa'di who last fall publicly pledged that Iraq was prepared to cooperate unconditionally with inspectors. Quite the contrary, Sa'di's job is not to cooperate; it is to deceive, not to disarm, but to undermine the inspectors; not to support them, but to frustrate them and to make sure they learn nothing.
We have learned a lot about the work of this special committee. We learned that just prior to the return of inspectors last November, the regime had decided to resume what we heard called ""the old game of cat-and-mouse.""
For example, let me focus on the now famous declaration that Iraq submitted to this Council on December 7th. Iraq never had any intention of complying with this Council's mandate. Instead, Iraq planned to use the declaration to overwhelm us and to overwhelm the inspectors with useless information about Iraq's permitted weapons so that we would not have time to pursue Iraq's prohibited weapons. Iraq's goal was to give us in this room, to give those of us on this Council, the false impression that the inspection process was working.
You saw the result. Dr. Blix pronounced the 12,200-page declaration ""rich in volume"" but ""poor in information and practically devoid of new evidence."" Could any member of this Council honestly rise in defense of this false declaration?
Everything we have seen and heard indicates that instead of cooperating actively with the inspectors to ensure the success of their mission, Saddam Hussein and his regime are busy doing all they possibly can to ensure that inspectors succeed in finding absolutely nothing.
My colleagues, every statement I make today is backed up by sources, solid sources. These are not assertions. What we are giving you are facts and conclusions based on solid intelligence. I will cite some examples, and these are from human sources.
Orders were issued to Iraq's security organizations, as well as to Saddam Hussein's own office, to hide all correspondence with the Organization of Military Industrialization. This is the organization that oversees Iraq's weapons of mass destruction activities. Make sure there are no documents left which would connect you to the OMI.
We know that Saddam's son, Qusay, ordered the removal of all prohibited weapons from Saddam's numerous palace complexes. We know that Iraqi government officials, members of the ruling Ba'ath Party and scientists have hidden prohibited items in their homes. Other key files from military and scientific establishments have been placed in cars that are being driven around the countryside by Iraqi intelligence agents to avoid detection.

Thanks to intelligence they were provided, the inspectors recently found dramatic confirmation of these reports. When they searched the homes of an Iraqi nuclear scientist, they uncovered roughly 2,000 pages of documents. You see them here being brought out of the home and placed in UN hands. Some of the material is classified and related to Iraq's nuclear program.
Tell me, answer me: Are the inspectors to search the house of every government official, every Ba'ath Party member and every scientist in the country to find the truth, to get the information they need to satisfy the demands of our Council?
Our sources tell us that in some cases the hard drives of computers at Iraqi weapons facilities were replaced. Who took the hard drives? Where did they go? What is being hidden? Why?
There is only one answer to the why: to deceive, to hide, to keep from the inspectors.
Numerous human sources tell us that the Iraqis are moving not just documents and hard drives, but weapons of mass destruction, to keep them from being found by inspectors. While we were here in this Council chamber debating Resolution 1441 last fall, we know, we know from sources that a missile brigade outside Baghdad was dispersing rocket launchers and warheads containing biological warfare agent to various locations, distributing them to various locations in western Iraq.
Most of the launchers and warheads had been hidden in large groves of palm trees and were to be moved every one to four weeks to escape detection.
We also have satellite photos that indicate that banned materials have recently been moved from a number of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction facilities.
Let me say a word about satellite images before I show a couple. The photos that I am about to show you are sometimes hard for the average person to interpret, hard for me. The painstaking work of photo analysis takes experts with years and years of experience, poring for hours and hours over light tables. But as I show you these images, I will try to capture and explain what they mean, what they indicate, to our imagery specialists.

Let's look at one. This one is about a weapons munition facility, a facility that holds ammunition at a place called Taji. This is one of about 65 such facilities in Iraq. We know that this one has housed chemical munitions. In fact, this is where the Iraqis recently came up with the additional four chemical weapons shells.
Here you see 15 munitions bunkers in yellow and red outlines. The four that are in red squares represent active chemical munitions bunkers.

How do I know that? How can I say that? Let me give you a closer look. Look at the image on the left. On the left is a close-up of one of the four chemical bunkers. The two arrows indicate the presence of sure signs that the bunkers are storing chemical munitions. The arrow at the top that says ""security"" points to a facility that is a signature item for this kind of bunker. Inside that facility are special guards and special equipment to monitor any leakage that might come out of the bunker. The truck you also see is a signature item. It's a decontamination vehicle in case something goes wrong. This is characteristic of those four bunkers. The special security facility and the decontamination vehicle will be in the area, if not at any one of them or one of the other, it is moving around those four and it moves as needed to move as people are working in the different bunkers.
Now look at the picture on the right. You are now looking at two of those sanitized bunkers. The signature vehicles are gone, the tents are gone. It's been cleaned up. And it was done on the 22nd of December as the UN inspection team is arriving, and you can see the inspection vehicles arriving in the lower portion of the picture on the right.
The bunkers are clean when the inspectors get there. They found nothing.
This sequence of events raises the worrisome suspicion that Iraq had been tipped off to the forthcoming inspections at Taji. As it did throughout the 1990s, we know that Iraq today is actively using its considerable intelligence capabilities to hide its illicit activities. From our sources, we know that inspectors are under constant surveillance by an army of Iraqi intelligence operatives. Iraq is relentlessly attempting to tap all of their communications, both voice and electronics. I would call my colleagues' attention to the fine paper that the United Kingdom distributed yesterday which describes in exquisite detail Iraqi deception activities.

In this next example, you will see the type of concealment activity Iraq has undertaken in response to the resumption of inspections. Indeed, in November of 2002, just when the inspections were about to resume, this type of activity spiked. Here are three examples.

At this ballistic missile site on November 10th, we saw a cargo truck preparing to move ballistic missile components.
At this biological weapons-related facility on November 25th, just two days before inspections resumed, this truck caravan appeared -- something we almost never see at this facility and we monitor it carefully and regularly.

At this ballistic missile facility, again, two days before inspections began, five large cargo trucks appeared, along with a truck-mounted crane, to move missiles.
We saw this kind of housecleaning at close to 30 sites. Days after this activity, the vehicles and the equipment that I've just highlighted disappear and the site returns to patterns of normalcy. We don't know precisely what Iraq was moving, but the inspectors already knew about these sites so Iraq knew that they would be coming.
We must ask ourselves: Why would Iraq suddenly move equipment of this nature before inspections if they were anxious to demonstrate what they had or did not have?
Remember the first intercept in which two Iraqis talked about the need to hide a modified vehicle from the inspectors. Where did Iraq take all of this equipment? Why wasn't it presented to the inspectors?

Iraq also has refused to permit any U-2 reconnaissance flights that would give the inspectors a better sense of what's being moved before, during and after inspections. This refusal to allow this kind of reconnaissance is in direct, specific violation of operative paragraph seven of our Resolution 1441.

Saddam Hussein and his regime are not just trying to conceal weapons; they are also trying to hide people. You know the basic facts. Iraq has not complied with its obligation to allow immediate, unimpeded, unrestricted and private access to all officials and other persons, as required by Resolution 1441. The regime only allows interviews with inspectors in the presence of an Iraqi official, a minder. The official Iraqi organization charged with facilitating inspections announced publicly and announced ominously, that, ""Nobody is ready"" to leave Iraq to be interviewed.
Iraqi Vice President Ramadan accused the inspectors of conducting espionage, a veiled threat that anyone cooperating with UN inspectors was committing treason.
Iraq did not meet its obligations under 1441 to provide a comprehensive list of scientists associated with its weapons of mass destruction programs. Iraq's list was out of date and contained only about 500 names despite the fact that UNSCOM had earlier put together a list of about 3,500 names.
Let me just tell you what a number of human sources have told us. Saddam Hussein has directly participated in the effort to prevent interviews. In early December, Saddam Hussein had all Iraqi scientists warned of the serious consequences that they and their families would face if they revealed any sensitive information to the inspectors. They were forced to sign documents acknowledging that divulging information is punishable by death.
Saddam Hussein also said that scientists should be told not to agree to leave Iraq; anyone who agreed to be interviewed outside Iraq would be treated as a spy. This violates 1441.
In mid-November, just before the inspectors returned, Iraqi experts were ordered to report to the headquarters of the Special Security Organization to receive counter-intelligence training. The training focused on evasion methods, interrogation resistance techniques, and how to mislead inspectors.
Ladies and gentlemen, these are not assertions. These are facts corroborated by many sources, some of them sources of the intelligence services of other countries.
For example, in mid-December, weapons experts at one facility were replaced by Iraqi intelligence agents who were to deceive inspectors about the work that was being done there. On orders from Saddam Hussein, Iraqi officials issued a false death certificate for one scientist and he was sent into hiding.
In the middle of January, experts at one facility that was related to weapons of mass destruction, those experts had been ordered to stay home from work to avoid the inspectors. Workers from other Iraqi military facilities not engaged in illicit weapons projects were to replace the workers who had been sent home. A dozen experts have been placed under house arrest -- not in their own houses, but as a group at one of Saddam Hussein's guest houses.
It goes on and on and on. As the examples I have just presented show, the information and intelligence we have gathered point to an active and systematic effort on the part of the Iraqi regime to keep key materials and people from the inspectors, in direct violation of Resolution 1441.
The pattern is not just one of reluctant cooperation, nor is it merely a lack of cooperation. What we see is a deliberate campaign to prevent any meaningful inspection work.
My colleagues, Operative Paragraph 4 of UN Resolution 1441, which we lingered over so long last fall, clearly states that false statements and omissions in the declaration and a failure by Iraq at any time to comply with and cooperate fully in the implementation of this resolution shall constitute -- the facts speak for themselves -- shall constitute a further material breach of its obligation.
We wrote it this way to give Iraq an early test, to give Iraq an early test. Would they give an honest declaration and would they, early on, indicate a willingness to cooperate with the inspectors? It was designed to be an early test. They failed that test.
By this standard, the standard of this Operative Paragraph, I believe that Iraq is now in further material breach of its obligations. I believe this conclusion is irrefutable and undeniable.
Iraq has now placed itself in danger of the serious consequences called for in UN Resolution 1441. And this body places itself in danger of irrelevance if it allows Iraq to continue to defy its will without responding effectively and immediately.
This issue before us is not how much time we are willing to give the inspectors to be frustrated by Iraqi obstruction. But how much longer are we willing to put up with Iraq's non-compliance before we, as a Council, we as the United Nations say, ""Enough. Enough.""

The gravity of this moment is matched by the gravity of the threat that Iraq's weapons of mass destruction pose to the world. Let me now turn to those deadly weapons programs and describe why they are real and present dangers to the region and to the world.
First, biological weapons. We have talked frequently here about biological weapons. By way of introduction and history, I think there are just three quick points I need to make. First, you will recall that it took UNSCOM four long and frustrating years to pry, to pry an admission out of Iraq that it had biological weapons. Second, when Iraq finally admitted having these weapons in 1995, the quantities were vast. Less than a teaspoon of dry anthrax, a little bit -- about this amount. This is just about the amount of a teaspoon. Less than a teaspoonful of dry anthrax in an envelope shut down the United States Senate in the fall of 2001.
This forced several hundred people to undergo emergency medical treatment and killed two postal workers just from an amount, just about this quantity that was inside of an envelope.
Iraq declared 8500 liters of anthrax. But UNSCOM estimates that Saddam Hussein could have produced 25,000 liters. If concentrated into this dry form, this amount would be enough to fill tens upon tens upon tens of thousands of teaspoons. And Saddam Hussein has not verifiably accounted for even one teaspoonful of this deadly material. And that is my third point. And it is key. The Iraqis have never accounted for all of the biological weapons they admitted they had and we know they had.
They have never accounted for all the organic material used to make them. And they have not accounted for many of the weapons filled with these agents such as their R-400 bombs. This is evidence, not conjecture. This is true. This is all well documented.
Dr. Blix told this Council that Iraq has provided little evidence to verify anthrax production and no convincing evidence of its destruction. It should come as no shock then that since Saddam Hussein forced out the last inspectors in 1998, we have amassed much intelligence indicating that Iraq is continuing to make these weapons.
One of the most worrisome things that emerges from the thick intelligence file we have on Iraq's biological weapons is the existence of mobile production facilities used to make biological agents.
Let me take you inside that intelligence file and share with you what we know from eyewitness accounts. We have first-hand descriptions of biological weapons factories on wheels and on rails.

The trucks and train cars are easily moved and are designed to evade detection by inspectors. In a matter of months, they can produce a quantity of biological poison equal to the entire amount that Iraq claimed to have produced in the years prior to the Gulf War.
Although Iraq's mobile production program began in the mid-1990s, UN inspectors at the time only had vague hints of such programs. Confirmation came later, in the year 2000. The source was an eyewitness, an Iraqi chemical engineer who supervised one of these facilities. He actually was present during biological agent production runs. He was also at the site when an accident occurred in 1998. 12 technicians died from exposure to biological agents.
He reported that when UNSCOM was in country and inspecting, the biological weapons agent production always began on Thursdays at midnight, because Iraq thought UNSCOM would not inspect on the Muslim holy day, Thursday night through Friday.
He added that this was important because the units could not be broken down in the middle of a production run, which had to be completed by Friday evening before the inspectors might arrive again.
This defector is currently hiding in another country with the certain knowledge that Saddam Hussein will kill him if he finds him. His eyewitness account of these mobile production facilities has been corroborated by other sources.
A second source. An Iraqi civil engineer in a position to know the details of the program confirmed the existence of transportable facilities moving on trailers.
A third source, also in a position to know, reported in summer, 2002, that Iraq had manufactured mobile production systems mounted on road-trailer units and on rail cars.
Finally, a fourth source. An Iraqi major who defected confirmed that Iraq has mobile biological research laboratories in addition to the production facilities I mentioned earlier.

We have diagrammed what our sources reported about these mobile facilities. Here you see both truck and rail-car mounted mobile factories. The description our sources gave us of the technical features required by such facilities is highly detailed and extremely accurate.
As these drawings, based on their description show, we know what the fermentors look like. We know what the tanks, pumps, compressors and other parts look like. We know how they fit together, we know how they work, and we know a great deal about the platforms on which they are mounted.
As shown in this diagram, these factories can be concealed easily -- either by moving ordinary looking trucks and rail-cars along Iraq's thousands of miles of highway or track or by parking them in a garage or a warehouse or somewhere in Iraq's extensive system of underground tunnels and bunkers.

We know that Iraq has at least seven of these mobile, biological agent factories. The truck-mounted ones have at least two or three trucks each. That means that the mobile production facilities are very few -- perhaps 18 trucks that we know of. There may be more. But perhaps 18 that we know of. Just imagine trying to find 18 trucks among the thousands and thousands of trucks that travel the roads of Iraq every single day.
It took the inspectors four years to find out that Iraq was making biological agents. How long do you think it will take the inspectors to find even one of these 18 trucks without Iraq coming forward as they are supposed to with the information about these kinds of capabilities.
Ladies and gentlemen, these are sophisticated facilities. For example, they can produce anthrax and botulinum toxin. In fact, they can produce enough dry, biological agent in a single month to kill thousands upon thousands of people. A dry agent of this type is the most lethal form for human beings.
By 1998, UN experts agreed that the Iraqis had perfected drying techniques for their biological weapons programs. Now Iraq has incorporated this drying expertise into these mobile production facilities.
We know from Iraq's past admissions that it has successfully weaponized not only anthrax, but also other biological agents including botulinum toxin, aflatoxin and ricin. But Iraq's research efforts did not stop there.
Saddam Hussein has investigated dozens of biological agents causing diseases such as gas gangrene, plague, typhus, tetanus, cholera, camelpox, and hemorrhagic fever. And he also has the wherewithal to develop smallpox.

The Iraqi regime has also developed ways to disperse lethal biological agents widely, indiscriminately into the water supply, into the air. For example, Iraq had a program to modify aerial fuel tanks for Mirage jets. This video of an Iraqi test flight obtained by UNSCOM some years ago shows an Iraqi F-1 Mirage jet aircraft. Note the spray coming from beneath the Mirage. That is 2,000 liters of simulated anthrax that a jet is spraying.
(VIDEO)
In 1995, an Iraqi military officer, Mujahid Saleh Abdul Latif told inspectors that Iraq intended the spray tanks to be mounted onto a MiG-21 that had been converted into an unmanned aerial vehicle, or UAV. UAVs outfitted with spray tanks constitute an ideal method for launching a terrorist attack using biological weapons.
Iraq admitted to producing four spray tanks, but to this day, it has provided no credible evidence that they were destroyed, evidence that was required by the international community.
There can be no doubt that Saddam Hussein has biological weapons and the capability to rapidly produce more, many more. And he has the ability to dispense these lethal poisons and diseases in ways that can cause massive death and destruction.

If biological weapons seem too terrible to contemplate, chemical weapons are equally chilling. UNMOVIC already laid out much of this and it is documented for all of us to read in UNSCOM's 1999 report on the subject. Let me set the stage with three key points that all of us need to keep in mind. First, Saddam Hussein has used these horrific weapons on another country and on his own people. In fact, in the history of chemical warfare, no country has had more battlefield experience with chemical weapons since World War I than Saddam Hussein's Iraq.
Second, as with biological weapons, Saddam Hussein has never accounted for vast amounts of chemical weaponry: 550 artillery shells with mustard, 30,000 empty munitions and enough precursors to increase his stockpile to as much as 500 tons of chemical agents.
If we consider just one category of missing weaponry, 6500 bombs from the Iran-Iraq War, UNMOVIC says the amount of chemical agent in them would be on the order of a thousand tons.
These quantities of chemical weapons are now unaccounted for. Dr. Blix has quipped that, ""Mustard gas is not marmalade. You are supposed to know what you did with it."" We believe Saddam Hussein knows what he did with it and he has not come clean with the international community.
We have evidence these weapons existed. What we don't have is evidence from Iraq that they have been destroyed or where they are. That is what we are still waiting for.
Third point, Iraq's record on chemical weapons is replete with lies. It took years for Iraq to finally admit that it had produced four tons of the deadly nerve agent VX. A single drop of VX on the skin will kill in minutes. Four tons. The admission only came out after inspectors collected documentation as a result of the defection of Hussein Kamel, Saddam Hussein's late son-in-law.
UNSCOM also gained forensic evidence that Iraq had produced VX and put it into weapons for delivery, yet to this day Iraq denies it had ever weaponized VX. And on January 27, UNMOVIC told this Council that it has information that conflicts with the Iraqi account of its VX program.
We know that Iraq has embedded key portions of its illicit chemical weapons infrastructure within its legitimate civilian industry. To all outward appearances, even to experts, the infrastructure looks like an ordinary civilian operation. Illicit and legitimate production can go on simultaneously or on a dime. This dual-use infrastructure can turn from clandestine to commercial and then back again.
These inspections would be unlikely, any inspections at such facilities, would be unlikely to turn up anything prohibited, especially if there is any warning that the inspections are coming. Call it ingenious or evil genius, but the Iraqis deliberately designed their chemical weapons programs to be inspected. It is infrastructure with a built in alibi.
Under the guise of dual-use infrastructure, Iraq has undertaken an effort to reconstitute facilities that were closely associated with its past program to develop and produce chemical weapons. For example, Iraq has rebuilt key portions of the Tareq State Establishment. Tareq includes facilities designed specifically for Iraq's chemical weapons program and employs key figures from past programs.
That's the production end of Saddam's chemical weapons business. What about the delivery end? I'm going to show you a small part of a chemical complex called ""Al Musayyib"", a site that Iraq has used for at least three years to transship chemical weapons from production facilities out to the field. In May 2002, our satellites photographed the unusual activity in this picture.

Here we see cargo vehicles are again at this transshipment point, and we can see that they are accompanied by a decontamination vehicle associated with biological or chemical weapons activity. What makes this picture significant is that we have a human source who has corroborated that movement of chemical weapons occurred at this site at that time. So it's not just the photo and it's not an individual seeing the photo. It's the photo and then the knowledge of an individual being brought together to make the case.

This photograph of the site taken two months later, in July, shows not only the previous site which is the figure in the middle at the top with the bulldozer sign near it, it shows that this previous site, as well as all of the other sites around the site have been fully bulldozed and graded. The topsoil has been removed. The Iraqis literally removed the crust of the earth from large portions of this site in order to conceal chemical weapons evidence that would be there from years of chemical weapons activity.
To support its deadly biological and chemical weapons programs, Iraq procures needed items from around the world using an extensive clandestine network. What we know comes largely from intercepted communications and human sources who are in a position to know the facts.
Iraq's procurement efforts include: equipment that can filter and separate microorganisms and toxins involved in biological weapons; equipment that can be used to concentrate the agent; growth media that can be used to continue producing anthrax and botulinum toxin; sterilization equipment for laboratories; glass-lined reactors and specialty pumps that can handle corrosive chemical weapons agents and precursors; large amounts of thionyl chloride, a precursor for nerve and blister agents; and other chemicals such as sodium sulfide, an important mustard agent precursor.
Now, of course, Iraq will argue that these items can also be used for legitimate purposes. But if that is true, why do we have to learn about them by intercepting communications and risking the lives of human agents?
With Iraq's well-documented history on biological and chemical weapons, why should any of us give Iraq the benefit of the doubt? I don't. And I don't think you will either after you hear this next intercept.
Just a few weeks ago we intercepted communications between two commanders in Iraq's Second Republican Guard Corps. One commander is going to be giving an instruction to the other. You will hear as this unfolds that what he wants to communicate to the other guy, he wants to make sure the other guy hears clearly to the point of repeating it so that it gets written down and completely understood. Listen.
(Transmission.) AUDIO

Let's review a few selected items of this conversation. Two officers talking to each other on the radio want to make sure that nothing is misunderstood. ""Remove."" ""Remove."" ""The expression."" ""The expression."" ""The expression. I got it."" ""Nerve agents."" ""Nerve agents."" ""Wherever it comes up."" ""Got it, wherever it comes up."" ""In the wireless instructions."" ""In the instructions."" ""Correction, no, in the wireless instructions."" ""Wireless, I got it.""
Why does he repeat it that way? Why is he so forceful in making sure this is understood? And why did he focus on wireless instructions? Because the senior officer is concerned that somebody might be listening. Well, somebody was.
""Nerve agents."" ""Stop talking about it."" ""They are listening to us"" ""Don't give any evidence that we have these horrible agents."" But we know that they do and this kind of conversation confirms it.
Our conservative estimate is that Iraq today has a stockpile of between 100 and 500 tons of chemical weapons agent. That is enough agent to fill 16,000 battlefield rockets. Even the low end of 100 tons of agent would enable Saddam Hussein to cause mass casualties across more than 100 square miles of territory, an area nearly five times the size of Manhattan.

Let me remind you that -- of the 122 mm chemical warheads that the UN inspectors found recently. This discovery could very well be, as has been noted, the tip of a submerged iceberg.
The question before us all, my friends, is when will we see the rest of the submerged iceberg?
(VIDEO)
Saddam Hussein has chemical weapons. Saddam Hussein has used such weapons. And Saddam Hussein has no compunction about using them again -- against his neighbors and against his own people. And we have sources who tell us that he recently has authorized his field commanders to use them. He wouldn't be passing out the orders if he didn't have the weapons or the intent to use them.
We also have sources who tell us that since the 1980s, Saddam's regime has been experimenting on human beings to perfect its biological or chemical weapons.
A source said that 1,600 death-row prisoners were transferred in 1995 to a special unit for such experiments. An eyewitness saw prisoners tied down to beds, experiments conducted on them, blood oozing around the victims' mouths, and autopsies performed to confirm the effects on the prisoners.
Saddam Hussein's humanity -- inhumanity has no limits.

Let me turn now to nuclear weapons. We have no indication that Saddam Hussein has ever abandoned his nuclear weapons program. On the contrary, we have more than a decade of proof that he remains determined to acquire nuclear weapons.
To fully appreciate the challenge that we face today, remember that in 1991 the inspectors searched Iraq's primary nuclear weapons facilities for the first time, and they found nothing to conclude that Iraq had a nuclear weapons program. But, based on defector information, in May of 1991, Saddam Hussein's lie was exposed. In truth, Saddam Hussein had a massive clandestine nuclear weapons program that covered several different techniques to enrich uranium, including electromagnetic isotope separation, gas centrifuge and gas diffusion.
We estimate that this illicit program cost the Iraqis several billion dollars. Nonetheless, Iraq continued to tell the IAEA that it had no nuclear weapons program. If Saddam had not been stopped, Iraq could have produced a nuclear bomb by 1993, years earlier than most worst case assessments that had been made before the war.
In 1995, as a result of another defector, we find out that, after his invasion of Kuwait, Saddam Hussein had initiated a crash program to build a crude nuclear weapon, in violation of Iraq's UN obligations. Saddam Hussein already possesses two out of the three key components needed to build a nuclear bomb. He has a cadre of nuclear scientists with the expertise and he has a bomb design.
Since 1998, his efforts to reconstitute his nuclear program have been focused on acquiring the third and last component: sufficient fissile material to produce a nuclear explosion. To make the fissile material, he needs to develop an ability to enrich uranium. Saddam Hussein is determined to get his hands on a nuclear bomb.

He is so determined that has made repeated covert attempts to acquire high-specification aluminum tubes from 11 different countries, even after inspections resumed. These tubes are controlled by the Nuclear Suppliers Group precisely because they can be used as centrifuges for enriching uranium.
By now, just about everyone has heard of these tubes and we all know that there are differences of opinion. There is controversy about what these tubes are for. Most U.S. experts think they are intended to serve as rotors in centrifuges used to enrich uranium. Other experts, and the Iraqis themselves, argue that they are really to produce the rocket bodies for a conventional weapon, a multiple rocket launcher.
Let me tell you what is not controversial about these tubes. First, all the experts who have analyzed the tubes in our possession agree that they can be adapted for centrifuge use.
Second, Iraq had no business buying them for any purpose. They are banned for Iraq.
I am no expert on centrifuge tubes, but this is an old army trooper. I can tell you a couple things.
First, it strikes me as quite odd that these tubes are manufactured to a tolerance that far exceeds U.S. requirements for comparable rockets. Maybe Iraqis just manufacture their conventional weapons to a higher standard than we do, but I don't think so.

Second, we actually have examined tubes from several different batches that were seized clandestinely before they reached Baghdad. What we notice in these different batches is a progression to higher and higher levels of specification, including in the latest batch an anodized coating on extremely smooth inner and outer surfaces.
Why would they continue refining the specifications? Why would they continuing refining the specification, go to all that trouble for something that, if it was a rocket, would soon be blown into shrapnel when it went off?
The high-tolerance aluminum tubes are only part of the story. We also have intelligence from multiple sources that Iraq is attempting to acquire magnets and high-speed balancing machines. Both items can be used in a gas centrifuge program to enrich uranium.
In 1999 and 2000, Iraqi officials negotiated with firms in Romania, India, Russia and Slovenia for the purchase of a magnet production plant. Iraq wanted the plant to produce magnets weighing 20 to 30 grams. That's the same weight as the magnets used in Iraq's gas centrifuge program before the Gulf War.
This incident, linked with the tubes, is another indicator of Iraq's attempt to reconstitute its nuclear weapons program.
Intercepted communications from mid-2000 through last summer showed that Iraq front companies sought to buy machines that can be used to balance gas centrifuge rotors. One of these companies also had been involved in a failed effort in 2001 to smuggle aluminum tubes into Iraq.
People will continue to debate this issue, but there is no doubt in my mind. These illicit procurement efforts show that Saddam Hussein is very much focused on putting in place the key missing piece from his nuclear weapons program, the ability to produce fissile material.
He also has been busy trying to maintain the other key parts of his nuclear program, particularly his cadre of key nuclear scientists. It is noteworthy that over the last 18 months Saddam Hussein has paid increasing personal attention to Iraq's top nuclear scientists, a group that the government-controlled press calls openly his ""nuclear mujaheddin."" He regularly exhorts them and praises their progress. Progress toward what end?

Long ago, the Security Council, this Council, required Iraq to halt all nuclear activities of any kind.
Let me talk now about the systems Iraq is developing to deliver weapons of mass destruction, in particular Iraq's ballistic missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles, UAVs.

First, missiles. We all remember that before the Gulf War Saddam Hussein's goal was missiles that flew not just hundreds, but thousands, of kilometers. He wanted to strike not only his neighbors, but also nations far beyond his borders.
While inspectors destroyed most of the prohibited ballistic missiles, numerous intelligence reports over the past decade from sources inside Iraq indicate that Saddam Hussein retains a covert force of up to a few dozen Scud-variant ballistic missiles. These are missiles with a range of 650 to 900 kilometers.
We know from intelligence and Iraq's own admissions that Iraq's alleged permitted ballistic missiles, the al-Samoud II and the Al-Fatah, violate the 150-kilometer limit established by this Council in Resolution 687. These are prohibited systems.
UNMOVIC has also reported that Iraq has illegally imported 380 SA-2 rocket engines. These are likely for use in the al-Samoud II. Their import was illegal on three counts: Resolution 687 prohibited all military shipments into Iraq; UNSCOM specifically prohibited use of these engines in surface-to-surface missiles; and finally, as we have just noted, they are for a system that exceeds the 150-kilometer range limit. Worst of all, some of these engines were acquired as late as December, after this Council passed Resolution 1441.
What I want you to know today is that Iraq has programs that are intended to produce ballistic missiles that fly over 1,000 kilometers. One program is pursuing a liquid fuel missile that would be able to fly more than 1,200 kilometers. And you can see from this map, as well as I can, who will be in danger of these missiles.

As part of this effort, another little piece of evidence, Iraq has built an engine test stand that is larger than anything it has ever had. Notice the dramatic difference in size between the test stand on the left, the old one, and the new one on the right. Note the large exhaust vent. This is where the flame from the engine comes out. The exhaust vent on the right test stand is five times longer than the one on the left. The one of the left is used for short-range missiles. The one on the right is clearly intended for long-range missiles that can fly 1,200 kilometers.
This photograph was taken in April of 2002. Since then, the test stand has been finished and a roof has been put over it so it will be harder for satellites to see what's going on underneath the test stand.
Saddam Hussein's intentions have never changed. He is not developing the missiles for self-defense. These are missiles that Iraq wants in order to project power, to threaten and to deliver chemical, biological -- and if we let him -- nuclear warheads.

Now, unmanned aerial vehicles, UAVs. Iraq has been working on a variety of UAVs for more than a decade. This is just illustrative of what a UAV would look like. This effort has included attempts to modify for unmanned flight the MiG-21 and, with greater success, an aircraft called the L-29.
However, Iraq is now concentrating not on these airplanes but on developing and testing smaller UAVs such as this. UAVs are well suited for dispensing chemical and biological weapons. There is ample evidence that Iraq has dedicated much effort to developing and testing spray devices that could be adapted for UAVs.
And in the little that Saddam Hussein told us about UAVs, he has not told the truth. One of these lies is graphically and indisputably demonstrated by intelligence we collected on June 27th last year.

According to Iraq's December 7th declaration, its UAVs have a range of only 80 kilometers. But we detected one of Iraq's newest UAVs in a test flight that went 500 kilometers nonstop on autopilot in the racetrack pattern depicted here.
Not only is this test well in excess of the 150 kilometers that the United Nations permits, the test was left out of Iraq’s December 7th declaration. The UAV was flown around and around and around in this circle and so that its 80-kilometer limit really was 500 kilometers, unrefueled and on autopilot -- violative of all of its obligations under 1441.
The linkages over the past ten years between Iraq's UAV program and biological and chemical warfare agents are of deep concern to us. Iraq could use these small UAVs which have a wingspan of only a few meters to deliver biological agents to its neighbors or, if transported, to other countries, including the United States.
My friends, the information I have presented to you about these terrible weapons and about Iraq's continued flaunting of its obligations under Security Council Resolution 1441 links to a subject I now want to spend a little bit of time on, and that has to do with terrorism.

Our concern is not just about these illicit weapons; it's the way that these illicit weapons can be connected to terrorists and terrorist organizations that have no compunction about using such devices against innocent people around the world.
Iraq and terrorism go back decades. Baghdad trains Palestine Liberation Front members in small arms and explosives. Saddam uses the Arab Liberation Front to funnel money to the families of Palestinian suicide bombers in order to prolong the Intifadah. And it's no secret that Saddam's own intelligence service was involved in dozens of attacks or attempted assassinations in the 1990s.
But what I want to bring to your attention today is the potentially much more sinister nexus between Iraq and the al-Qaida terrorist network, a nexus that combines classic terrorist organizations and modern methods of murder. Iraq today harbors a deadly terrorist network headed by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi an associate and collaborator of Usama bin Laden and his al-Qaida lieutenants.
Zarqawi, Palestinian born in Jordan, fought in the Afghan war more than a decade ago. Returning to Afghanistan in 2000, he oversaw a terrorist training camp. One of his specialties, and one of the specialties of this camp, is poisons.

When our coalition ousted the Taliban, the Zarqawi network helped establish another poison and explosive training center camp, and this camp is located in northeastern Iraq. You see a picture of this camp.
The network is teaching its operatives how to produce ricin and other poisons. Let me remind you how ricin works. Less than a pinch -- imagine a pinch of salt -- less than a pinch of ricin, eating just this amount in your food, would cause shock, followed by circulatory failure. Death comes within 72 hours and there is no antidote. There is no cure. It is fatal.

Those helping to run this camp are Zarqawi lieutenants operating in northern Kurdish areas outside Saddam Hussein's controlled Iraq. But Baghdad has an agent in the most senior levels of the radical organization Ansar al-Islam that controls this corner of Iraq. In 2000, this agent offered al-Qaida safe haven in the region.
After we swept al-Qaida from Afghanistan, some of those members accepted this safe haven. They remain there today.
Zarqawi's activities are not confined to this small corner of northeast Iraq. He traveled to Baghdad in May of 2002 for medical treatment, staying in the capital of Iraq for two months while he recuperated to fight another day.
During his stay, nearly two dozen extremists converged on Baghdad and established a base of operations there. These al-Qaida affiliates based in Baghdad now coordinate the movement of people, money and supplies into and throughout Iraq for his network, and they have now been operating freely in the capital for more than eight months.
Iraqi officials deny accusations of ties with al-Qaida. These denials are simply not credible. Last year, an al-Qaida associate bragged that the situation in Iraq was ""good,"" that Baghdad could be transited quickly.
We know these affiliates are connected to Zarqawi because they remain, even today, in regular contact with his direct subordinates, include the poison cell plotters. And they are involved in moving more than money and materiel. Last year, two suspected al-Qaida operatives were arrested crossing from Iraq into Saudi Arabia. They were linked to associates of the Baghdad cell and one of them received training in Afghanistan on how to use cyanide.
From his terrorist network in Iraq, Zarqawi can direct his network in the Middle East and beyond. We in the United States, all of us, the State Department and the Agency for International Development, we all lost a dear friend with the cold-blooded murder of Mr. Laurence Foley in Amman, Jordan, last October. A despicable act was committed that day, the assassination of an individual whose sole mission was to assist the people of Jordan. The captured assassin says his cell received money and weapons from Zarqawi for that murder. After the attack, an associate of the assassin left Jordan to go to Iraq to obtain weapons and explosives for further operations. Iraqi officials protest that they are not aware of the whereabouts of Zarqawi or of any of his associates. Again, these protests are not credible. We know of Zarqawi's activities in Baghdad. I described them earlier.
Now let me add one other fact. We asked a friendly security service to approach Baghdad about extraditing Zarqawi and providing information about him and his close associates. This service contacted Iraqi officials twice and we passed details that should have made it easy to find Zarqawi. The network remains in Baghdad. Zarqawi still remains at large, to come and go.

As my colleagues around this table and as the citizens they represent in Europe know, Zarqawi's terrorism is not confined to the Middle East. Zarqawi and his network have plotted terrorist actions against countries including France, Britain, Spain, Italy, Germany and Russia. According to detainees Abu Atiya, who graduated from Zarqawi's terrorist camp in Afghanistan, tasked at least nine North African extremists in 2001 to travel to Europe to conduct poison and explosive attacks.

Since last year, members of this network have been apprehended in France, Britain, Spain and Italy. By our last count, 116 operatives connected to this global web have been arrested. The chart you are seeing shows the network in Europe.
We know about this European network and we know about its links to Zarqawi because the detainees who provided the information about the targets also provided the names of members of the network. Three of those he identified by name were arrested in France last December. In the apartments of the terrorists, authorities found circuits for explosive devices and a list of ingredients to make toxins.
The detainee who helped piece this together says the plot also targeted Britain. Later evidence again proved him right. When the British unearthed the cell there just last month, one British police officer was murdered during the destruction of the cell.

We also know that Zarqawi's colleagues have been active in the Pankisi Gorge, Georgia, and in Chechnya, Russia. The plotting to which they are linked is not mere chatter. Members of Zarqawi's network say their goal was to kill Russians with toxins.
We are not surprised that Iraq is harboring Zarqawi and his subordinates. This understanding builds on decades-long experience with respect to ties between Iraq and al-Qaida. Going back to the early and mid-1990s when bin Laden was based in Sudan, an al-Qaida source tells us that Saddam and bin Laden reached an understanding that al-Qaida would no longer support activities against Baghdad. Early al-Qaida ties were forged by secret high-level intelligence service contacts with al-Qaida, secret Iraqi intelligence high-level contacts with al-Qaida.
We know members of both organizations met repeatedly and have met at least eight times at very senior levels since the early 1990s. In 1996, a foreign security service tells us that bin Laden met with a senior Iraqi intelligence official in Khartoum and later met the director of the Iraqi intelligence service.
Saddam became more interested as he saw al-Qaida's appalling attacks. A detained al-Qaida member tells us that Saddam was more willing to assist al-Qaida after the 1998 bombings of our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Saddam was also impressed by al-Qaida's attacks on the USS Cole in Yemen in October 2000.
Iraqis continue to visit bin Laden in his new home in Afghanistan. A senior defector, one of Saddam's former intelligence chiefs in Europe, says Saddam sent his agents to Afghanistan sometime in the mid-1990s to provide training to al-Qaida members on document forgery.
From the late 1990s until 2001, the Iraqi Embassy in Pakistan played the role of liaison to the al-Qaida organization.
Some believe, some claim, these contacts do not amount to much. They say Saddam Hussein's secular tyranny and al-Qaida's religious tyranny do not mix. I am not comforted by this thought. Ambition and hatred are enough to bring Iraq and al-Qaida together, enough so al-Qaida could learn how to build more sophisticated bombs and learn how to forge documents, and enough so that al-Qaida could turn to Iraq for help in acquiring expertise on weapons of mass destruction.
And the record of Saddam Hussein's cooperation with other Islamist terrorist organizations is clear. Hamas, for example, opened an office in Baghdad in 1999 and Iraq has hosted conferences attended by Palestine Islamic Jihad. These groups are at the forefront of sponsoring suicide attacks against Israel.
Al-Qaida continues to have a deep interest in acquiring weapons of mass destruction. As with the story of Zarqawi and his network, I can trace the story of a senior terrorist operative telling how Iraq provided training in these weapons to al-Qaida. Fortunately, this operative is now detained and he has told his story. I will relate it to you now as he, himself, described it.
This senior al-Qaida terrorist was responsible for one of al-Qaida's training camps in Afghanistan. His information comes firsthand from his personal involvement at senior levels of al-Qaida. He says bin Laden and his top deputy in Afghanistan, deceased al-Qaida leader Muhammad Atif, did not believe that al-Qaida labs in Afghanistan were capable enough to manufacture these chemical or biological agents. They needed to go somewhere else. They had to look outside of Afghanistan for help.
Where did they go? Where did they look? They went to Iraq. The support that this detainee describes included Iraq offering chemical or biological weapons training for two al-Qaida associates beginning in December 2000. He says that a militant known as Abdallah al-Iraqi had been sent to Iraq several times between 1997 and 2000 for help in acquiring poisons and gasses. Abdallah al-Iraqi characterized the relationship he forged with Iraqi officials as successful.
As I said at the outset, none of this should come as a surprise to any of us. Terrorism has been a tool used by Saddam for decades. Saddam was a supporter of terrorism long before these terrorist networks had a name, and this support continues. The nexus of poisons and terror is new. The nexus of Iraq and terror is old. The combination is lethal.
With this track record, Iraqi denials of supporting terrorism take their place alongside the other Iraqi denials of weapons of mass destruction. It is all a web of lies.
When we confront a regime that harbors ambitions for regional domination, hides weapons of mass destruction, and provides haven and active support for terrorists, we are not confronting the past; we are confronting the present. And unless we act, we are confronting an even more frightening future.

And, friends, this has been a long and a detailed presentation and I thank you for your patience, but there is one more subject that I would like to touch on briefly, and it should be a subject of deep and continuing concern to this Council: Saddam Hussein's violations of human rights.
Underlying all that I have said, underlying all the facts and the patterns of behavior that I have identified, is Saddam Hussein's contempt for the will of this Council, his contempt for the truth, and, most damning of all, his utter contempt for human life. Saddam Hussein's use of mustard and nerve gas against the Kurds in 1988 was one of the 20th century's most horrible atrocities. Five thousand men, women and children died. His campaign against the Kurds from 1987 to '89 included mass summary executions, disappearances, arbitrary jailing and ethnic cleansing, and the destruction of some 2,000 villages.
He has also conducted ethnic cleansing against the Shia Iraqis and the Marsh Arabs whose culture has flourished for more than a millennium. Saddam Hussein's police state ruthlessly eliminates anyone who dares to dissent. Iraq has more forced disappearance cases than any other country -- tens of thousands of people reported missing in the past decade.
Nothing points more clearly to Saddam Hussein's dangerous intentions and the threat he poses to all of us than his calculated cruelty to his own citizens and to his neighbors. Clearly, Saddam Hussein and his regime will stop at nothing until something stops him.

 
For more than 20 years, by word and by deed, Saddam Hussein has pursued his ambition to dominate Iraq and the broader Middle East using the only means he knows: intimidation, coercion and annihilation of all those who might stand in his way. For Saddam Hussein, possession of the world's most deadly weapons is the ultimate trump card, the one he must hold to fulfill his ambition.
We know that Saddam Hussein is determined to keep his weapons of mass destruction, is determined to make more. Given Saddam Hussein's history of aggression, given what we know of his grandiose plans, given what we know of his terrorist associations, and given his determination to exact revenge on those who oppose him, should we take the risk that he will not someday use these weapons at a time and a place and in a manner of his choosing, at a time when the world is in a much weaker position to respond?
The United States will not and cannot run that risk for the American people. Leaving Saddam Hussein in possession of weapons of mass destruction for a few more months or years is not an option, not in a post-September 11th world.
My colleagues, over three months ago, this Council recognized that Iraq continued to pose a threat to international peace and security, and that Iraq had been and remained in material breach of its disarmament obligations.
Today, Iraq still poses a threat and Iraq still remains in material breach. Indeed, by its failure to seize on its one last opportunity to come clean and disarm, Iraq has put itself in deeper material breach and closer to the day when it will face serious consequences for its continue defiance of this Council.
My colleagues, we have an obligation to our citizens. We have an obligation to this body to see that our resolutions are complied with. We wrote 1441 not in order to go to war. We wrote 1441 to try to preserve the peace. We wrote 1441 to give Iraq one last chance.
Iraq is not, so far, taking that one last chance.
We must not shrink from whatever is ahead of us. We must not fail in our duty and our responsibility to the citizens of the countries that are represented by this body.
Thank you, Mr. President.

SECRETARY POWELL: Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President and Mr. Secretary General, distinguished colleagues, I would like to begin by expressing my thanks for the special effort that each of you made to be here today. This is an important day for us all as we review the situation with respect to Iraq and its disarmament obligations under UN Security Council Resolution 1441.

Last November 8, this Council passed Resolution 1441 by a unanimous vote. The purpose of that resolution was to disarm Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction. Iraq had already been found guilty of material breach of its obligations stretching back over 16 previous resolutions and 12 years.



Resolution 1441 was not dealing with an innocent party, but a regime this Council has repeatedly convicted over the years.

Resolution 1441 gave Iraq one last chance, one last chance to come into compliance or to face serious consequences. No Council member present and voting on that day had any illusions about the nature and intent of the resolution or what serious consequences meant if Iraq did not comply.

And to assist in its disarmament, we called on Iraq to cooperate with returning inspectors from UNMOVIC and IAEA. We laid down tough standards for Iraq to meet to allow the inspectors to do their job.



This Council placed the burden on Iraq to comply and disarm, and not on the inspectors to find that which Iraq has gone out of its way to conceal for so long. Inspectors are inspectors; they are not detectives.

I asked for this session today for two purposes. First, to support the core assessments made by Dr. Blix and Dr. ElBaradei. As Dr. Blix reported to this Council on January 27, ""Iraq appears not to have come to a genuine acceptance, not even today, of the disarmament which was demanded of it.""

And as Dr. ElBaradei reported, Iraq's declaration of December 7 ""did not provide any new information relevant to certain questions that have been outstanding since 1998.""

My second purpose today is to provide you with additional information, to share with you what the United States knows about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, as well as Iraq's involvement in terrorism, which is also the subject of Resolution 1441 and other earlier resolutions.

I might add at this point that we are providing all relevant information we can to the inspection teams for them to do their work.

The material I will present to you comes from a variety of sources. Some are U.S. sources and some are those of other countries. Some are the sources are technical, such as intercepted telephone conversations and photos taken by satellites. Other sources are people who have risked their lives to let the world know what Saddam Hussein is really up to.

I cannot tell you everything that we know, but what I can share with you, when combined with what all of us have learned over the years, is deeply troubling. What you will see is an accumulation of facts and disturbing patterns of behavior. The facts and Iraqis' behavior, Iraq's behavior, demonstrate that Saddam Hussein and his regime have made no effort, no effort, to disarm, as required by the international community.

Indeed, the facts and Iraq's behavior show that Saddam Hussein and his regime are concealing their efforts to produce more weapons of mass destruction.

Let me begin by playing a tape for you. What you’re about to hear is a conversation that my government monitored. It takes place on November 26th of last year, on the day before United Nations teams resumed inspections in Iraq. The conversation involves two senior officers, a colonel and a brigadier general from Iraq's elite military unit, the Republican Guard.

[The tape is played.] AUDIO



SECRETARY POWELL: Let me pause and review some of the key elements of this conversation that you just heard between these two officers.

First, they acknowledge that our colleague, Mohammed ElBaradei is coming, and they know what he's coming for and they know he's coming the next day. He's coming to look for things that are prohibited. He is expecting these gentlemen to cooperate with him and not hide things.

But they're worried. We have this modified vehicle. What do we say if one of them sees it? What is their concern? Their concern is that it's something they should not have, something that should not be seen.

The general was incredulous: ""You didn't get it modified. You don't have one of those, do you?""



""I have one.""

""Which? From where?""

""From the workshop. From the Al-Kindi Company.""

""What?""

""From Al-Kindi.""

""I'll come to see you in the morning. I'm worried you all have something left.""



""We evacuated everything. We don't have anything left.""

Note what he says: ""We evacuated everything."" We didn't destroy it. We didn't line it up for inspection. We didn't turn it into the inspectors. We evacuated it to make sure it was not around when the inspectors showed up. ""I will come to you tomorrow.""

The Al-Kindi Company. This is a company that is well known to have been involved in prohibited weapons systems activity.

Let me play another tape for you. As you will recall, the inspectors found 12 empty chemical warheads on January 16th. On January 20th, four days later, Iraq promised the inspectors it would search for more. You will now hear an officer from Republican Guard headquarters issuing an instruction to an officer in the field. Their conversation took place just last week, on January 30.

[The tape was played.] AUDIO

SECRETARY POWELL: Let me pause again and review the elements of this message.



""They are inspecting the ammunition you have, yes?""

""Yes. For the possibility there are forbidden ammo.""

""For the possibility there is, by chance, forbidden ammo?""



""Yes.

""And we sent you a message yesterday to clean out all the areas, the scrap areas, the abandoned areas. Make sure there is nothing there. Remember the first message: evacuate it.""

This is all part of a system of hiding things and moving things out of the way and making sure they have left nothing behind.



You go a little further into this message and you see the specific instructions from headquarters: ""After you have carried out what is contained in this message, destroy the message because I don't want anyone to see this message.""

""Okay.""

""Okay.""

Why? Why? This message would have verified to the inspectors that they have been trying to turn over things. They were looking for things, but they don't want that message seen because they were trying to clean up the area, to leave no evidence behind of the presence of weapons of mass destruction. And they can claim that nothing was there and the inspectors can look all they want and they will find nothing.

This effort to hide things from the inspectors is not one or two isolated events. Quite the contrary, this is part and parcel of a policy of evasion and deception that goes back 12 years, a policy set at the highest levels of the Iraqi regime.

We know that Saddam Hussein has what is called ""a Higher Committee for Monitoring the Inspection Teams."" Think about that. Iraq has a high-level committee to monitor the inspectors who were sent in to monitor Iraq's disarmament -- not to cooperate with them, not to assist them, but to spy on them and keep them from doing their jobs.

The committee reports directly to Saddam Hussein. It is headed by Iraq's Vice President, Taha Yasin Ramadan. Its members include Saddam Hussein's son, Qusay.

This committee also includes Lieutenant General Amir al-Sa'di, an advisor to Saddam. In case that name isn't immediately familiar to you, General Sa'di has been the Iraqi regime's primary point of contact for Dr. Blix and Dr. ElBaradei. It was General Sa'di who last fall publicly pledged that Iraq was prepared to cooperate unconditionally with inspectors. Quite the contrary, Sa'di's job is not to cooperate; it is to deceive, not to disarm, but to undermine the inspectors; not to support them, but to frustrate them and to make sure they learn nothing.

We have learned a lot about the work of this special committee. We learned that just prior to the return of inspectors last November, the regime had decided to resume what we heard called ""the old game of cat-and-mouse.""

For example, let me focus on the now famous declaration that Iraq submitted to this Council on December 7th. Iraq never had any intention of complying with this Council's mandate. Instead, Iraq planned to use the declaration to overwhelm us and to overwhelm the inspectors with useless information about Iraq's permitted weapons so that we would not have time to pursue Iraq's prohibited weapons. Iraq's goal was to give us in this room, to give those of us on this Council, the false impression that the inspection process was working.

You saw the result. Dr. Blix pronounced the 12,200-page declaration ""rich in volume"" but ""poor in information and practically devoid of new evidence."" Could any member of this Council honestly rise in defense of this false declaration?

Everything we have seen and heard indicates that instead of cooperating actively with the inspectors to ensure the success of their mission, Saddam Hussein and his regime are busy doing all they possibly can to ensure that inspectors succeed in finding absolutely nothing.

My colleagues, every statement I make today is backed up by sources, solid sources. These are not assertions. What we are giving you are facts and conclusions based on solid intelligence. I will cite some examples, and these are from human sources.

Orders were issued to Iraq's security organizations, as well as to Saddam Hussein's own office, to hide all correspondence with the Organization of Military Industrialization. This is the organization that oversees Iraq's weapons of mass destruction activities. Make sure there are no documents left which would connect you to the OMI.

We know that Saddam's son, Qusay, ordered the removal of all prohibited weapons from Saddam's numerous palace complexes. We know that Iraqi government officials, members of the ruling Ba'ath Party and scientists have hidden prohibited items in their homes. Other key files from military and scientific establishments have been placed in cars that are being driven around the countryside by Iraqi intelligence agents to avoid detection.



Thanks to intelligence they were provided, the inspectors recently found dramatic confirmation of these reports. When they searched the homes of an Iraqi nuclear scientist, they uncovered roughly 2,000 pages of documents. You see them here being brought out of the home and placed in UN hands. Some of the material is classified and related to Iraq's nuclear program.

Tell me, answer me: Are the inspectors to search the house of every government official, every Ba'ath Party member and every scientist in the country to find the truth, to get the information they need to satisfy the demands of our Council?

Our sources tell us that in some cases the hard drives of computers at Iraqi weapons facilities were replaced. Who took the hard drives? Where did they go? What is being hidden? Why?

There is only one answer to the why: to deceive, to hide, to keep from the inspectors.

Numerous human sources tell us that the Iraqis are moving not just documents and hard drives, but weapons of mass destruction, to keep them from being found by inspectors. While we were here in this Council chamber debating Resolution 1441 last fall, we know, we know from sources that a missile brigade outside Baghdad was dispersing rocket launchers and warheads containing biological warfare agent to various locations, distributing them to various locations in western Iraq.

Most of the launchers and warheads had been hidden in large groves of palm trees and were to be moved every one to four weeks to escape detection.

We also have satellite photos that indicate that banned materials have recently been moved from a number of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction facilities.

Let me say a word about satellite images before I show a couple. The photos that I am about to show you are sometimes hard for the average person to interpret, hard for me. The painstaking work of photo analysis takes experts with years and years of experience, poring for hours and hours over light tables. But as I show you these images, I will try to capture and explain what they mean, what they indicate, to our imagery specialists.



Let's look at one. This one is about a weapons munition facility, a facility that holds ammunition at a place called Taji. This is one of about 65 such facilities in Iraq. We know that this one has housed chemical munitions. In fact, this is where the Iraqis recently came up with the additional four chemical weapons shells.

Here you see 15 munitions bunkers in yellow and red outlines. The four that are in red squares represent active chemical munitions bunkers.



How do I know that? How can I say that? Let me give you a closer look. Look at the image on the left. On the left is a close-up of one of the four chemical bunkers. The two arrows indicate the presence of sure signs that the bunkers are storing chemical munitions. The arrow at the top that says ""security"" points to a facility that is a signature item for this kind of bunker. Inside that facility are special guards and special equipment to monitor any leakage that might come out of the bunker. The truck you also see is a signature item. It's a decontamination vehicle in case something goes wrong. This is characteristic of those four bunkers. The special security facility and the decontamination vehicle will be in the area, if not at any one of them or one of the other, it is moving around those four and it moves as needed to move as people are working in the different bunkers.

Now look at the picture on the right. You are now looking at two of those sanitized bunkers. The signature vehicles are gone, the tents are gone. It's been cleaned up. And it was done on the 22nd of December as the UN inspection team is arriving, and you can see the inspection vehicles arriving in the lower portion of the picture on the right.

The bunkers are clean when the inspectors get there. They found nothing.

This sequence of events raises the worrisome suspicion that Iraq had been tipped off to the forthcoming inspections at Taji. As it did throughout the 1990s, we know that Iraq today is actively using its considerable intelligence capabilities to hide its illicit activities. From our sources, we know that inspectors are under constant surveillance by an army of Iraqi intelligence operatives. Iraq is relentlessly attempting to tap all of their communications, both voice and electronics. I would call my colleagues' attention to the fine paper that the United Kingdom distributed yesterday which describes in exquisite detail Iraqi deception activities.



In this next example, you will see the type of concealment activity Iraq has undertaken in response to the resumption of inspections. Indeed, in November of 2002, just when the inspections were about to resume, this type of activity spiked. Here are three examples.



At this ballistic missile site on November 10th, we saw a cargo truck preparing to move ballistic missile components.

At this biological weapons-related facility on November 25th, just two days before inspections resumed, this truck caravan appeared -- something we almost never see at this facility and we monitor it carefully and regularly.



At this ballistic missile facility, again, two days before inspections began, five large cargo trucks appeared, along with a truck-mounted crane, to move missiles.

We saw this kind of housecleaning at close to 30 sites. Days after this activity, the vehicles and the equipment that I've just highlighted disappear and the site returns to patterns of normalcy. We don't know precisely what Iraq was moving, but the inspectors already knew about these sites so Iraq knew that they would be coming.

We must ask ourselves: Why would Iraq suddenly move equipment of this nature before inspections if they were anxious to demonstrate what they had or did not have?

Remember the first intercept in which two Iraqis talked about the need to hide a modified vehicle from the inspectors. Where did Iraq take all of this equipment? Why wasn't it presented to the inspectors?



Iraq also has refused to permit any U-2 reconnaissance flights that would give the inspectors a better sense of what's being moved before, during and after inspections. This refusal to allow this kind of reconnaissance is in direct, specific violation of operative paragraph seven of our Resolution 1441.



Saddam Hussein and his regime are not just trying to conceal weapons; they are also trying to hide people. You know the basic facts. Iraq has not complied with its obligation to allow immediate, unimpeded, unrestricted and private access to all officials and other persons, as required by Resolution 1441. The regime only allows interviews with inspectors in the presence of an Iraqi official, a minder. The official Iraqi organization charged with facilitating inspections announced publicly and announced ominously, that, ""Nobody is ready"" to leave Iraq to be interviewed.

Iraqi Vice President Ramadan accused the inspectors of conducting espionage, a veiled threat that anyone cooperating with UN inspectors was committing treason.

Iraq did not meet its obligations under 1441 to provide a comprehensive list of scientists associated with its weapons of mass destruction programs. Iraq's list was out of date and contained only about 500 names despite the fact that UNSCOM had earlier put together a list of about 3,500 names.

Let me just tell you what a number of human sources have told us. Saddam Hussein has directly participated in the effort to prevent interviews. In early December, Saddam Hussein had all Iraqi scientists warned of the serious consequences that they and their families would face if they revealed any sensitive information to the inspectors. They were forced to sign documents acknowledging that divulging information is punishable by death.

Saddam Hussein also said that scientists should be told not to agree to leave Iraq; anyone who agreed to be interviewed outside Iraq would be treated as a spy. This violates 1441.

In mid-November, just before the inspectors returned, Iraqi experts were ordered to report to the headquarters of the Special Security Organization to receive counter-intelligence training. The training focused on evasion methods, interrogation resistance techniques, and how to mislead inspectors.

Ladies and gentlemen, these are not assertions. These are facts corroborated by many sources, some of them sources of the intelligence services of other countries.

For example, in mid-December, weapons experts at one facility were replaced by Iraqi intelligence agents who were to deceive inspectors about the work that was being done there. On orders from Saddam Hussein, Iraqi officials issued a false death certificate for one scientist and he was sent into hiding.

In the middle of January, experts at one facility that was related to weapons of mass destruction, those experts had been ordered to stay home from work to avoid the inspectors. Workers from other Iraqi military facilities not engaged in illicit weapons projects were to replace the workers who had been sent home. A dozen experts have been placed under house arrest -- not in their own houses, but as a group at one of Saddam Hussein's guest houses.

It goes on and on and on. As the examples I have just presented show, the information and intelligence we have gathered point to an active and systematic effort on the part of the Iraqi regime to keep key materials and people from the inspectors, in direct violation of Resolution 1441.

The pattern is not just one of reluctant cooperation, nor is it merely a lack of cooperation. What we see is a deliberate campaign to prevent any meaningful inspection work.

My colleagues, Operative Paragraph 4 of UN Resolution 1441, which we lingered over so long last fall, clearly states that false statements and omissions in the declaration and a failure by Iraq at any time to comply with and cooperate fully in the implementation of this resolution shall constitute -- the facts speak for themselves -- shall constitute a further material breach of its obligation.

We wrote it this way to give Iraq an early test, to give Iraq an early test. Would they give an honest declaration and would they, early on, indicate a willingness to cooperate with the inspectors? It was designed to be an early test. They failed that test.

By this standard, the standard of this Operative Paragraph, I believe that Iraq is now in further material breach of its obligations. I believe this conclusion is irrefutable and undeniable.

Iraq has now placed itself in danger of the serious consequences called for in UN Resolution 1441. And this body places itself in danger of irrelevance if it allows Iraq to continue to defy its will without responding effectively and immediately.

This issue before us is not how much time we are willing to give the inspectors to be frustrated by Iraqi obstruction. But how much longer are we willing to put up with Iraq's non-compliance before we, as a Council, we as the United Nations say, ""Enough. Enough.""



The gravity of this moment is matched by the gravity of the threat that Iraq's weapons of mass destruction pose to the world. Let me now turn to those deadly weapons programs and describe why they are real and present dangers to the region and to the world.

First, biological weapons. We have talked frequently here about biological weapons. By way of introduction and history, I think there are just three quick points I need to make. First, you will recall that it took UNSCOM four long and frustrating years to pry, to pry an admission out of Iraq that it had biological weapons. Second, when Iraq finally admitted having these weapons in 1995, the quantities were vast. Less than a teaspoon of dry anthrax, a little bit -- about this amount. This is just about the amount of a teaspoon. Less than a teaspoonful of dry anthrax in an envelope shut down the United States Senate in the fall of 2001.

This forced several hundred people to undergo emergency medical treatment and killed two postal workers just from an amount, just about this quantity that was inside of an envelope.

Iraq declared 8500 liters of anthrax. But UNSCOM estimates that Saddam Hussein could have produced 25,000 liters. If concentrated into this dry form, this amount would be enough to fill tens upon tens upon tens of thousands of teaspoons. And Saddam Hussein has not verifiably accounted for even one teaspoonful of this deadly material. And that is my third point. And it is key. The Iraqis have never accounted for all of the biological weapons they admitted they had and we know they had.

They have never accounted for all the organic material used to make them. And they have not accounted for many of the weapons filled with these agents such as their R-400 bombs. This is evidence, not conjecture. This is true. This is all well documented.

Dr. Blix told this Council that Iraq has provided little evidence to verify anthrax production and no convincing evidence of its destruction. It should come as no shock then that since Saddam Hussein forced out the last inspectors in 1998, we have amassed much intelligence indicating that Iraq is continuing to make these weapons.

One of the most worrisome things that emerges from the thick intelligence file we have on Iraq's biological weapons is the existence of mobile production facilities used to make biological agents.

Let me take you inside that intelligence file and share with you what we know from eyewitness accounts. We have first-hand descriptions of biological weapons factories on wheels and on rails.



The trucks and train cars are easily moved and are designed to evade detection by inspectors. In a matter of months, they can produce a quantity of biological poison equal to the entire amount that Iraq claimed to have produced in the years prior to the Gulf War.

Although Iraq's mobile production program began in the mid-1990s, UN inspectors at the time only had vague hints of such programs. Confirmation came later, in the year 2000. The source was an eyewitness, an Iraqi chemical engineer who supervised one of these facilities. He actually was present during biological agent production runs. He was also at the site when an accident occurred in 1998. 12 technicians died from exposure to biological agents.

He reported that when UNSCOM was in country and inspecting, the biological weapons agent production always began on Thursdays at midnight, because Iraq thought UNSCOM would not inspect on the Muslim holy day, Thursday night through Friday.

He added that this was important because the units could not be broken down in the middle of a production run, which had to be completed by Friday evening before the inspectors might arrive again.

This defector is currently hiding in another country with the certain knowledge that Saddam Hussein will kill him if he finds him. His eyewitness account of these mobile production facilities has been corroborated by other sources.

A second source. An Iraqi civil engineer in a position to know the details of the program confirmed the existence of transportable facilities moving on trailers.

A third source, also in a position to know, reported in summer, 2002, that Iraq had manufactured mobile production systems mounted on road-trailer units and on rail cars.

Finally, a fourth source. An Iraqi major who defected confirmed that Iraq has mobile biological research laboratories in addition to the production facilities I mentioned earlier.



We have diagrammed what our sources reported about these mobile facilities. Here you see both truck and rail-car mounted mobile factories. The description our sources gave us of the technical features required by such facilities is highly detailed and extremely accurate.

As these drawings, based on their description show, we know what the fermentors look like. We know what the tanks, pumps, compressors and other parts look like. We know how they fit together, we know how they work, and we know a great deal about the platforms on which they are mounted.

As shown in this diagram, these factories can be concealed easily -- either by moving ordinary looking trucks and rail-cars along Iraq's thousands of miles of highway or track or by parking them in a garage or a warehouse or somewhere in Iraq's extensive system of underground tunnels and bunkers.



We know that Iraq has at least seven of these mobile, biological agent factories. The truck-mounted ones have at least two or three trucks each. That means that the mobile production facilities are very few -- perhaps 18 trucks that we know of. There may be more. But perhaps 18 that we know of. Just imagine trying to find 18 trucks among the thousands and thousands of trucks that travel the roads of Iraq every single day.

It took the inspectors four years to find out that Iraq was making biological agents. How long do you think it will take the inspectors to find even one of these 18 trucks without Iraq coming forward as they are supposed to with the information about these kinds of capabilities.

Ladies and gentlemen, these are sophisticated facilities. For example, they can produce anthrax and botulinum toxin. In fact, they can produce enough dry, biological agent in a single month to kill thousands upon thousands of people. A dry agent of this type is the most lethal form for human beings.

By 1998, UN experts agreed that the Iraqis had perfected drying techniques for their biological weapons programs. Now Iraq has incorporated this drying expertise into these mobile production facilities.

We know from Iraq's past admissions that it has successfully weaponized not only anthrax, but also other biological agents including botulinum toxin, aflatoxin and ricin. But Iraq's research efforts did not stop there.

Saddam Hussein has investigated dozens of biological agents causing diseases such as gas gangrene, plague, typhus, tetanus, cholera, camelpox, and hemorrhagic fever. And he also has the wherewithal to develop smallpox.



The Iraqi regime has also developed ways to disperse lethal biological agents widely, indiscriminately into the water supply, into the air. For example, Iraq had a program to modify aerial fuel tanks for Mirage jets. This video of an Iraqi test flight obtained by UNSCOM some years ago shows an Iraqi F-1 Mirage jet aircraft. Note the spray coming from beneath the Mirage. That is 2,000 liters of simulated anthrax that a jet is spraying.
(VIDEO)

In 1995, an Iraqi military officer, Mujahid Saleh Abdul Latif told inspectors that Iraq intended the spray tanks to be mounted onto a MiG-21 that had been converted into an unmanned aerial vehicle, or UAV. UAVs outfitted with spray tanks constitute an ideal method for launching a terrorist attack using biological weapons.

Iraq admitted to producing four spray tanks, but to this day, it has provided no credible evidence that they were destroyed, evidence that was required by the international community.

There can be no doubt that Saddam Hussein has biological weapons and the capability to rapidly produce more, many more. And he has the ability to dispense these lethal poisons and diseases in ways that can cause massive death and destruction.



If biological weapons seem too terrible to contemplate, chemical weapons are equally chilling. UNMOVIC already laid out much of this and it is documented for all of us to read in UNSCOM's 1999 report on the subject. Let me set the stage with three key points that all of us need to keep in mind. First, Saddam Hussein has used these horrific weapons on another country and on his own people. In fact, in the history of chemical warfare, no country has had more battlefield experience with chemical weapons since World War I than Saddam Hussein's Iraq.

Second, as with biological weapons, Saddam Hussein has never accounted for vast amounts of chemical weaponry: 550 artillery shells with mustard, 30,000 empty munitions and enough precursors to increase his stockpile to as much as 500 tons of chemical agents.

If we consider just one category of missing weaponry, 6500 bombs from the Iran-Iraq War, UNMOVIC says the amount of chemical agent in them would be on the order of a thousand tons.

These quantities of chemical weapons are now unaccounted for. Dr. Blix has quipped that, ""Mustard gas is not marmalade. You are supposed to know what you did with it."" We believe Saddam Hussein knows what he did with it and he has not come clean with the international community.

We have evidence these weapons existed. What we don't have is evidence from Iraq that they have been destroyed or where they are. That is what we are still waiting for.

Third point, Iraq's record on chemical weapons is replete with lies. It took years for Iraq to finally admit that it had produced four tons of the deadly nerve agent VX. A single drop of VX on the skin will kill in minutes. Four tons. The admission only came out after inspectors collected documentation as a result of the defection of Hussein Kamel, Saddam Hussein's late son-in-law.

UNSCOM also gained forensic evidence that Iraq had produced VX and put it into weapons for delivery, yet to this day Iraq denies it had ever weaponized VX. And on January 27, UNMOVIC told this Council that it has information that conflicts with the Iraqi account of its VX program.

We know that Iraq has embedded key portions of its illicit chemical weapons infrastructure within its legitimate civilian industry. To all outward appearances, even to experts, the infrastructure looks like an ordinary civilian operation. Illicit and legitimate production can go on simultaneously or on a dime. This dual-use infrastructure can turn from clandestine to commercial and then back again.

These inspections would be unlikely, any inspections at such facilities, would be unlikely to turn up anything prohibited, especially if there is any warning that the inspections are coming. Call it ingenious or evil genius, but the Iraqis deliberately designed their chemical weapons programs to be inspected. It is infrastructure with a built in alibi.

Under the guise of dual-use infrastructure, Iraq has undertaken an effort to reconstitute facilities that were closely associated with its past program to develop and produce chemical weapons. For example, Iraq has rebuilt key portions of the Tareq State Establishment. Tareq includes facilities designed specifically for Iraq's chemical weapons program and employs key figures from past programs.

That's the production end of Saddam's chemical weapons business. What about the delivery end? I'm going to show you a small part of a chemical complex called ""Al Musayyib"", a site that Iraq has used for at least three years to transship chemical weapons from production facilities out to the field. In May 2002, our satellites photographed the unusual activity in this picture.



Here we see cargo vehicles are again at this transshipment point, and we can see that they are accompanied by a decontamination vehicle associated with biological or chemical weapons activity. What makes this picture significant is that we have a human source who has corroborated that movement of chemical weapons occurred at this site at that time. So it's not just the photo and it's not an individual seeing the photo. It's the photo and then the knowledge of an individual being brought together to make the case.



This photograph of the site taken two months later, in July, shows not only the previous site which is the figure in the middle at the top with the bulldozer sign near it, it shows that this previous site, as well as all of the other sites around the site have been fully bulldozed and graded. The topsoil has been removed. The Iraqis literally removed the crust of the earth from large portions of this site in order to conceal chemical weapons evidence that would be there from years of chemical weapons activity.

To support its deadly biological and chemical weapons programs, Iraq procures needed items from around the world using an extensive clandestine network. What we know comes largely from intercepted communications and human sources who are in a position to know the facts.

Iraq's procurement efforts include: equipment that can filter and separate microorganisms and toxins involved in biological weapons; equipment that can be used to concentrate the agent; growth media that can be used to continue producing anthrax and botulinum toxin; sterilization equipment for laboratories; glass-lined reactors and specialty pumps that can handle corrosive chemical weapons agents and precursors; large amounts of thionyl chloride, a precursor for nerve and blister agents; and other chemicals such as sodium sulfide, an important mustard agent precursor.

Now, of course, Iraq will argue that these items can also be used for legitimate purposes. But if that is true, why do we have to learn about them by intercepting communications and risking the lives of human agents?

With Iraq's well-documented history on biological and chemical weapons, why should any of us give Iraq the benefit of the doubt? I don't. And I don't think you will either after you hear this next intercept.

Just a few weeks ago we intercepted communications between two commanders in Iraq's Second Republican Guard Corps. One commander is going to be giving an instruction to the other. You will hear as this unfolds that what he wants to communicate to the other guy, he wants to make sure the other guy hears clearly to the point of repeating it so that it gets written down and completely understood. Listen.

(Transmission.) AUDIO



Let's review a few selected items of this conversation. Two officers talking to each other on the radio want to make sure that nothing is misunderstood. ""Remove."" ""Remove."" ""The expression."" ""The expression."" ""The expression. I got it."" ""Nerve agents."" ""Nerve agents."" ""Wherever it comes up."" ""Got it, wherever it comes up."" ""In the wireless instructions."" ""In the instructions."" ""Correction, no, in the wireless instructions."" ""Wireless, I got it.""

Why does he repeat it that way? Why is he so forceful in making sure this is understood? And why did he focus on wireless instructions? Because the senior officer is concerned that somebody might be listening. Well, somebody was.

""Nerve agents."" ""Stop talking about it."" ""They are listening to us"" ""Don't give any evidence that we have these horrible agents."" But we know that they do and this kind of conversation confirms it.

Our conservative estimate is that Iraq today has a stockpile of between 100 and 500 tons of chemical weapons agent. That is enough agent to fill 16,000 battlefield rockets. Even the low end of 100 tons of agent would enable Saddam Hussein to cause mass casualties across more than 100 square miles of territory, an area nearly five times the size of Manhattan.



Let me remind you that -- of the 122 mm chemical warheads that the UN inspectors found recently. This discovery could very well be, as has been noted, the tip of a submerged iceberg.

The question before us all, my friends, is when will we see the rest of the submerged iceberg?

(VIDEO)

Saddam Hussein has chemical weapons. Saddam Hussein has used such weapons. And Saddam Hussein has no compunction about using them again -- against his neighbors and against his own people. And we have sources who tell us that he recently has authorized his field commanders to use them. He wouldn't be passing out the orders if he didn't have the weapons or the intent to use them.

We also have sources who tell us that since the 1980s, Saddam's regime has been experimenting on human beings to perfect its biological or chemical weapons.

A source said that 1,600 death-row prisoners were transferred in 1995 to a special unit for such experiments. An eyewitness saw prisoners tied down to beds, experiments conducted on them, blood oozing around the victims' mouths, and autopsies performed to confirm the effects on the prisoners.

Saddam Hussein's humanity -- inhumanity has no limits.



Let me turn now to nuclear weapons. We have no indication that Saddam Hussein has ever abandoned his nuclear weapons program. On the contrary, we have more than a decade of proof that he remains determined to acquire nuclear weapons.

To fully appreciate the challenge that we face today, remember that in 1991 the inspectors searched Iraq's primary nuclear weapons facilities for the first time, and they found nothing to conclude that Iraq had a nuclear weapons program. But, based on defector information, in May of 1991, Saddam Hussein's lie was exposed. In truth, Saddam Hussein had a massive clandestine nuclear weapons program that covered several different techniques to enrich uranium, including electromagnetic isotope separation, gas centrifuge and gas diffusion.

We estimate that this illicit program cost the Iraqis several billion dollars. Nonetheless, Iraq continued to tell the IAEA that it had no nuclear weapons program. If Saddam had not been stopped, Iraq could have produced a nuclear bomb by 1993, years earlier than most worst case assessments that had been made before the war.

In 1995, as a result of another defector, we find out that, after his invasion of Kuwait, Saddam Hussein had initiated a crash program to build a crude nuclear weapon, in violation of Iraq's UN obligations. Saddam Hussein already possesses two out of the three key components needed to build a nuclear bomb. He has a cadre of nuclear scientists with the expertise and he has a bomb design.

Since 1998, his efforts to reconstitute his nuclear program have been focused on acquiring the third and last component: sufficient fissile material to produce a nuclear explosion. To make the fissile material, he needs to develop an ability to enrich uranium. Saddam Hussein is determined to get his hands on a nuclear bomb.



He is so determined that has made repeated covert attempts to acquire high-specification aluminum tubes from 11 different countries, even after inspections resumed. These tubes are controlled by the Nuclear Suppliers Group precisely because they can be used as centrifuges for enriching uranium.

By now, just about everyone has heard of these tubes and we all know that there are differences of opinion. There is controversy about what these tubes are for. Most U.S. experts think they are intended to serve as rotors in centrifuges used to enrich uranium. Other experts, and the Iraqis themselves, argue that they are really to produce the rocket bodies for a conventional weapon, a multiple rocket launcher.

Let me tell you what is not controversial about these tubes. First, all the experts who have analyzed the tubes in our possession agree that they can be adapted for centrifuge use.

Second, Iraq had no business buying them for any purpose. They are banned for Iraq.

I am no expert on centrifuge tubes, but this is an old army trooper. I can tell you a couple things.

First, it strikes me as quite odd that these tubes are manufactured to a tolerance that far exceeds U.S. requirements for comparable rockets. Maybe Iraqis just manufacture their conventional weapons to a higher standard than we do, but I don't think so.



Second, we actually have examined tubes from several different batches that were seized clandestinely before they reached Baghdad. What we notice in these different batches is a progression to higher and higher levels of specification, including in the latest batch an anodized coating on extremely smooth inner and outer surfaces.

Why would they continue refining the specifications? Why would they continuing refining the specification, go to all that trouble for something that, if it was a rocket, would soon be blown into shrapnel when it went off?

The high-tolerance aluminum tubes are only part of the story. We also have intelligence from multiple sources that Iraq is attempting to acquire magnets and high-speed balancing machines. Both items can be used in a gas centrifuge program to enrich uranium.

In 1999 and 2000, Iraqi officials negotiated with firms in Romania, India, Russia and Slovenia for the purchase of a magnet production plant. Iraq wanted the plant to produce magnets weighing 20 to 30 grams. That's the same weight as the magnets used in Iraq's gas centrifuge program before the Gulf War.

This incident, linked with the tubes, is another indicator of Iraq's attempt to reconstitute its nuclear weapons program.

Intercepted communications from mid-2000 through last summer showed that Iraq front companies sought to buy machines that can be used to balance gas centrifuge rotors. One of these companies also had been involved in a failed effort in 2001 to smuggle aluminum tubes into Iraq.

People will continue to debate this issue, but there is no doubt in my mind. These illicit procurement efforts show that Saddam Hussein is very much focused on putting in place the key missing piece from his nuclear weapons program, the ability to produce fissile material.

He also has been busy trying to maintain the other key parts of his nuclear program, particularly his cadre of key nuclear scientists. It is noteworthy that over the last 18 months Saddam Hussein has paid increasing personal attention to Iraq's top nuclear scientists, a group that the government-controlled press calls openly his ""nuclear mujaheddin."" He regularly exhorts them and praises their progress. Progress toward what end?



Long ago, the Security Council, this Council, required Iraq to halt all nuclear activities of any kind.

Let me talk now about the systems Iraq is developing to deliver weapons of mass destruction, in particular Iraq's ballistic missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles, UAVs.



First, missiles. We all remember that before the Gulf War Saddam Hussein's goal was missiles that flew not just hundreds, but thousands, of kilometers. He wanted to strike not only his neighbors, but also nations far beyond his borders.

While inspectors destroyed most of the prohibited ballistic missiles, numerous intelligence reports over the past decade from sources inside Iraq indicate that Saddam Hussein retains a covert force of up to a few dozen Scud-variant ballistic missiles. These are missiles with a range of 650 to 900 kilometers.

We know from intelligence and Iraq's own admissions that Iraq's alleged permitted ballistic missiles, the al-Samoud II and the Al-Fatah, violate the 150-kilometer limit established by this Council in Resolution 687. These are prohibited systems.

UNMOVIC has also reported that Iraq has illegally imported 380 SA-2 rocket engines. These are likely for use in the al-Samoud II. Their import was illegal on three counts: Resolution 687 prohibited all military shipments into Iraq; UNSCOM specifically prohibited use of these engines in surface-to-surface missiles; and finally, as we have just noted, they are for a system that exceeds the 150-kilometer range limit. Worst of all, some of these engines were acquired as late as December, after this Council passed Resolution 1441.

What I want you to know today is that Iraq has programs that are intended to produce ballistic missiles that fly over 1,000 kilometers. One program is pursuing a liquid fuel missile that would be able to fly more than 1,200 kilometers. And you can see from this map, as well as I can, who will be in danger of these missiles.



As part of this effort, another little piece of evidence, Iraq has built an engine test stand that is larger than anything it has ever had. Notice the dramatic difference in size between the test stand on the left, the old one, and the new one on the right. Note the large exhaust vent. This is where the flame from the engine comes out. The exhaust vent on the right test stand is five times longer than the one on the left. The one of the left is used for short-range missiles. The one on the right is clearly intended for long-range missiles that can fly 1,200 kilometers.

This photograph was taken in April of 2002. Since then, the test stand has been finished and a roof has been put over it so it will be harder for satellites to see what's going on underneath the test stand.

Saddam Hussein's intentions have never changed. He is not developing the missiles for self-defense. These are missiles that Iraq wants in order to project power, to threaten and to deliver chemical, biological -- and if we let him -- nuclear warheads.



Now, unmanned aerial vehicles, UAVs. Iraq has been working on a variety of UAVs for more than a decade. This is just illustrative of what a UAV would look like. This effort has included attempts to modify for unmanned flight the MiG-21 and, with greater success, an aircraft called the L-29.

However, Iraq is now concentrating not on these airplanes but on developing and testing smaller UAVs such as this. UAVs are well suited for dispensing chemical and biological weapons. There is ample evidence that Iraq has dedicated much effort to developing and testing spray devices that could be adapted for UAVs.

And in the little that Saddam Hussein told us about UAVs, he has not told the truth. One of these lies is graphically and indisputably demonstrated by intelligence we collected on June 27th last year.



According to Iraq's December 7th declaration, its UAVs have a range of only 80 kilometers. But we detected one of Iraq's newest UAVs in a test flight that went 500 kilometers nonstop on autopilot in the racetrack pattern depicted here.

Not only is this test well in excess of the 150 kilometers that the United Nations permits, the test was left out of Iraq’s December 7th declaration. The UAV was flown around and around and around in this circle and so that its 80-kilometer limit really was 500 kilometers, unrefueled and on autopilot -- violative of all of its obligations under 1441.

The linkages over the past ten years between Iraq's UAV program and biological and chemical warfare agents are of deep concern to us. Iraq could use these small UAVs which have a wingspan of only a few meters to deliver biological agents to its neighbors or, if transported, to other countries, including the United States.

My friends, the information I have presented to you about these terrible weapons and about Iraq's continued flaunting of its obligations under Security Council Resolution 1441 links to a subject I now want to spend a little bit of time on, and that has to do with terrorism.



Our concern is not just about these illicit weapons; it's the way that these illicit weapons can be connected to terrorists and terrorist organizations that have no compunction about using such devices against innocent people around the world.

Iraq and terrorism go back decades. Baghdad trains Palestine Liberation Front members in small arms and explosives. Saddam uses the Arab Liberation Front to funnel money to the families of Palestinian suicide bombers in order to prolong the Intifadah. And it's no secret that Saddam's own intelligence service was involved in dozens of attacks or attempted assassinations in the 1990s.

But what I want to bring to your attention today is the potentially much more sinister nexus between Iraq and the al-Qaida terrorist network, a nexus that combines classic terrorist organizations and modern methods of murder. Iraq today harbors a deadly terrorist network headed by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi an associate and collaborator of Usama bin Laden and his al-Qaida lieutenants.

Zarqawi, Palestinian born in Jordan, fought in the Afghan war more than a decade ago. Returning to Afghanistan in 2000, he oversaw a terrorist training camp. One of his specialties, and one of the specialties of this camp, is poisons.



When our coalition ousted the Taliban, the Zarqawi network helped establish another poison and explosive training center camp, and this camp is located in northeastern Iraq. You see a picture of this camp.

The network is teaching its operatives how to produce ricin and other poisons. Let me remind you how ricin works. Less than a pinch -- imagine a pinch of salt -- less than a pinch of ricin, eating just this amount in your food, would cause shock, followed by circulatory failure. Death comes within 72 hours and there is no antidote. There is no cure. It is fatal.



Those helping to run this camp are Zarqawi lieutenants operating in northern Kurdish areas outside Saddam Hussein's controlled Iraq. But Baghdad has an agent in the most senior levels of the radical organization Ansar al-Islam that controls this corner of Iraq. In 2000, this agent offered al-Qaida safe haven in the region.

After we swept al-Qaida from Afghanistan, some of those members accepted this safe haven. They remain there today.

Zarqawi's activities are not confined to this small corner of northeast Iraq. He traveled to Baghdad in May of 2002 for medical treatment, staying in the capital of Iraq for two months while he recuperated to fight another day.

During his stay, nearly two dozen extremists converged on Baghdad and established a base of operations there. These al-Qaida affiliates based in Baghdad now coordinate the movement of people, money and supplies into and throughout Iraq for his network, and they have now been operating freely in the capital for more than eight months.

Iraqi officials deny accusations of ties with al-Qaida. These denials are simply not credible. Last year, an al-Qaida associate bragged that the situation in Iraq was ""good,"" that Baghdad could be transited quickly.

We know these affiliates are connected to Zarqawi because they remain, even today, in regular contact with his direct subordinates, include the poison cell plotters. And they are involved in moving more than money and materiel. Last year, two suspected al-Qaida operatives were arrested crossing from Iraq into Saudi Arabia. They were linked to associates of the Baghdad cell and one of them received training in Afghanistan on how to use cyanide.

From his terrorist network in Iraq, Zarqawi can direct his network in the Middle East and beyond. We in the United States, all of us, the State Department and the Agency for International Development, we all lost a dear friend with the cold-blooded murder of Mr. Laurence Foley in Amman, Jordan, last October. A despicable act was committed that day, the assassination of an individual whose sole mission was to assist the people of Jordan. The captured assassin says his cell received money and weapons from Zarqawi for that murder. After the attack, an associate of the assassin left Jordan to go to Iraq to obtain weapons and explosives for further operations. Iraqi officials protest that they are not aware of the whereabouts of Zarqawi or of any of his associates. Again, these protests are not credible. We know of Zarqawi's activities in Baghdad. I described them earlier.

Now let me add one other fact. We asked a friendly security service to approach Baghdad about extraditing Zarqawi and providing information about him and his close associates. This service contacted Iraqi officials twice and we passed details that should have made it easy to find Zarqawi. The network remains in Baghdad. Zarqawi still remains at large, to come and go.



As my colleagues around this table and as the citizens they represent in Europe know, Zarqawi's terrorism is not confined to the Middle East. Zarqawi and his network have plotted terrorist actions against countries including France, Britain, Spain, Italy, Germany and Russia. According to detainees Abu Atiya, who graduated from Zarqawi's terrorist camp in Afghanistan, tasked at least nine North African extremists in 2001 to travel to Europe to conduct poison and explosive attacks.



Since last year, members of this network have been apprehended in France, Britain, Spain and Italy. By our last count, 116 operatives connected to this global web have been arrested. The chart you are seeing shows the network in Europe.

We know about this European network and we know about its links to Zarqawi because the detainees who provided the information about the targets also provided the names of members of the network. Three of those he identified by name were arrested in France last December. In the apartments of the terrorists, authorities found circuits for explosive devices and a list of ingredients to make toxins.

The detainee who helped piece this together says the plot also targeted Britain. Later evidence again proved him right. When the British unearthed the cell there just last month, one British police officer was murdered during the destruction of the cell.



We also know that Zarqawi's colleagues have been active in the Pankisi Gorge, Georgia, and in Chechnya, Russia. The plotting to which they are linked is not mere chatter. Members of Zarqawi's network say their goal was to kill Russians with toxins.

We are not surprised that Iraq is harboring Zarqawi and his subordinates. This understanding builds on decades-long experience with respect to ties between Iraq and al-Qaida. Going back to the early and mid-1990s when bin Laden was based in Sudan, an al-Qaida source tells us that Saddam and bin Laden reached an understanding that al-Qaida would no longer support activities against Baghdad. Early al-Qaida ties were forged by secret high-level intelligence service contacts with al-Qaida, secret Iraqi intelligence high-level contacts with al-Qaida.

We know members of both organizations met repeatedly and have met at least eight times at very senior levels since the early 1990s. In 1996, a foreign security service tells us that bin Laden met with a senior Iraqi intelligence official in Khartoum and later met the director of the Iraqi intelligence service.

Saddam became more interested as he saw al-Qaida's appalling attacks. A detained al-Qaida member tells us that Saddam was more willing to assist al-Qaida after the 1998 bombings of our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Saddam was also impressed by al-Qaida's attacks on the USS Cole in Yemen in October 2000.

Iraqis continue to visit bin Laden in his new home in Afghanistan. A senior defector, one of Saddam's former intelligence chiefs in Europe, says Saddam sent his agents to Afghanistan sometime in the mid-1990s to provide training to al-Qaida members on document forgery.

From the late 1990s until 2001, the Iraqi Embassy in Pakistan played the role of liaison to the al-Qaida organization.

Some believe, some claim, these contacts do not amount to much. They say Saddam Hussein's secular tyranny and al-Qaida's religious tyranny do not mix. I am not comforted by this thought. Ambition and hatred are enough to bring Iraq and al-Qaida together, enough so al-Qaida could learn how to build more sophisticated bombs and learn how to forge documents, and enough so that al-Qaida could turn to Iraq for help in acquiring expertise on weapons of mass destruction.

And the record of Saddam Hussein's cooperation with other Islamist terrorist organizations is clear. Hamas, for example, opened an office in Baghdad in 1999 and Iraq has hosted conferences attended by Palestine Islamic Jihad. These groups are at the forefront of sponsoring suicide attacks against Israel.

Al-Qaida continues to have a deep interest in acquiring weapons of mass destruction. As with the story of Zarqawi and his network, I can trace the story of a senior terrorist operative telling how Iraq provided training in these weapons to al-Qaida. Fortunately, this operative is now detained and he has told his story. I will relate it to you now as he, himself, described it.

This senior al-Qaida terrorist was responsible for one of al-Qaida's training camps in Afghanistan. His information comes firsthand from his personal involvement at senior levels of al-Qaida. He says bin Laden and his top deputy in Afghanistan, deceased al-Qaida leader Muhammad Atif, did not believe that al-Qaida labs in Afghanistan were capable enough to manufacture these chemical or biological agents. They needed to go somewhere else. They had to look outside of Afghanistan for help.

Where did they go? Where did they look? They went to Iraq. The support that this detainee describes included Iraq offering chemical or biological weapons training for two al-Qaida associates beginning in December 2000. He says that a militant known as Abdallah al-Iraqi had been sent to Iraq several times between 1997 and 2000 for help in acquiring poisons and gasses. Abdallah al-Iraqi characterized the relationship he forged with Iraqi officials as successful.

As I said at the outset, none of this should come as a surprise to any of us. Terrorism has been a tool used by Saddam for decades. Saddam was a supporter of terrorism long before these terrorist networks had a name, and this support continues. The nexus of poisons and terror is new. The nexus of Iraq and terror is old. The combination is lethal.

With this track record, Iraqi denials of supporting terrorism take their place alongside the other Iraqi denials of weapons of mass destruction. It is all a web of lies.

When we confront a regime that harbors ambitions for regional domination, hides weapons of mass destruction, and provides haven and active support for terrorists, we are not confronting the past; we are confronting the present. And unless we act, we are confronting an even more frightening future.



And, friends, this has been a long and a detailed presentation and I thank you for your patience, but there is one more subject that I would like to touch on briefly, and it should be a subject of deep and continuing concern to this Council: Saddam Hussein's violations of human rights.

Underlying all that I have said, underlying all the facts and the patterns of behavior that I have identified, is Saddam Hussein's contempt for the will of this Council, his contempt for the truth, and, most damning of all, his utter contempt for human life. Saddam Hussein's use of mustard and nerve gas against the Kurds in 1988 was one of the 20th century's most horrible atrocities. Five thousand men, women and children died. His campaign against the Kurds from 1987 to '89 included mass summary executions, disappearances, arbitrary jailing and ethnic cleansing, and the destruction of some 2,000 villages.

He has also conducted ethnic cleansing against the Shia Iraqis and the Marsh Arabs whose culture has flourished for more than a millennium. Saddam Hussein's police state ruthlessly eliminates anyone who dares to dissent. Iraq has more forced disappearance cases than any other country -- tens of thousands of people reported missing in the past decade.

Nothing points more clearly to Saddam Hussein's dangerous intentions and the threat he poses to all of us than his calculated cruelty to his own citizens and to his neighbors. Clearly, Saddam Hussein and his regime will stop at nothing until something stops him.





For more than 20 years, by word and by deed, Saddam Hussein has pursued his ambition to dominate Iraq and the broader Middle East using the only means he knows: intimidation, coercion and annihilation of all those who might stand in his way. For Saddam Hussein, possession of the world's most deadly weapons is the ultimate trump card, the one he must hold to fulfill his ambition.

We know that Saddam Hussein is determined to keep his weapons of mass destruction, is determined to make more. Given Saddam Hussein's history of aggression, given what we know of his grandiose plans, given what we know of his terrorist associations, and given his determination to exact revenge on those who oppose him, should we take the risk that he will not someday use these weapons at a time and a place and in a manner of his choosing, at a time when the world is in a much weaker position to respond?

The United States will not and cannot run that risk for the American people. Leaving Saddam Hussein in possession of weapons of mass destruction for a few more months or years is not an option, not in a post-September 11th world.

My colleagues, over three months ago, this Council recognized that Iraq continued to pose a threat to international peace and security, and that Iraq had been and remained in material breach of its disarmament obligations.

Today, Iraq still poses a threat and Iraq still remains in material breach. Indeed, by its failure to seize on its one last opportunity to come clean and disarm, Iraq has put itself in deeper material breach and closer to the day when it will face serious consequences for its continue defiance of this Council.

My colleagues, we have an obligation to our citizens. We have an obligation to this body to see that our resolutions are complied with. We wrote 1441 not in order to go to war. We wrote 1441 to try to preserve the peace. We wrote 1441 to give Iraq one last chance.

Iraq is not, so far, taking that one last chance.

We must not shrink from whatever is ahead of us. We must not fail in our duty and our responsibility to the citizens of the countries that are represented by this body.

Thank you, Mr. President.

Colin Powell,20030821,Interview With Vladimir Varfalomeyev at Ekho Moskvy Radio,"QUESTION: It is 9:22 a.m. in Moscow. Good morning. Here is Vladimir Varfolomeyev. I am glad to greet our guest from the United States, the Secretary of the State, Collin Powell. Hello, Mister Secretary. 
SECRETARY POWELL: Good morning. It is good to be back. 
QUESTION: We are glad to great you at this station again. It has become a good tradition to have you here during your visits to Moscow. You do not only have official negotiations but answer our questions and the questions of listeners. Taking into account that you came to Moscow from Tbilisi, our first questions are about Georgia. We know that yesterday you discussed this issue with President Putin and the Minister of Foreign Affairs Ivanov. Is it possible to tell now when the Russian military bases will be transferred from Georgia? As far as we know, this is one of the most serious questions. . 
SECRETARY POWELL: I cant answer that question. That is a matter for Russian authorities and the Georgian authorities to work out through discussions and negotiations over time. 
The U.S. position is that those forces should come out in accordance with the Istanbul commitments that the Russian Federation entered into in 1999. 
But I was impressed by the open attitude that President Putin had toward this question yesterday when we discussed it and I know that he and Foreign Minister Ivanov will be working with the new leadership of Georgia to come up with a solution to the situation. 
We wish the Georgian people all the best under their new leadership and the United States looks forward to cooperating with the Russian Federation in helping the Georgian people put in place a stable democracy. 
QUESTION: To help -- does this mean in the first place with funding, doesnt it? There was information in the media, referring to a representative of the State Department, that the United States is ready to provide a certain amount of money to speed up the process of Russian troop withdrawal. How much money are we talking about? . 
SECRETARY POWELL: So Georgia has many needs and we will be providing something in the neighborhood of $166 million in this fiscal year for the Georgians. And we have had some conversations with the Russian Federation about providing some financial assistance to assist in the transit of the forces out of the bases in Georgia and back into the Russian Federation, but there are no specific numbers that I could give you right now. 
QUESTION: There are many hot points in the world, and in some regions Russia and the United States cooperate. However, this does not apply to Iraq. As it is well known, our country did not send its troops to Iraq. But, as far as I understand from your yesterdays meetings in Moscow, both Putin and Ivanov appear to approve of the current mission of the United States in Iraq. Is it so? 
SECRETARY POWELL: Yes, we had a positive discussion about Iraq. There is no question that last year we had a serious disagreement. Russia did not support our military campaign in Iraq, but now we are cooperating to help the Iraqis build a democracy for themselves. Russia joined us in getting passage of U.N. Resolution 1511 which brought the International community back together. 
Russian firms are not working in Iraq under direct contracts with Iraqi companies and Iraq authorities. And we have had discussions with Russia about debt relief for Iraq. And I think there will be further contracting opportunities and sub-contracting opportunities for Russian firms in Iraq. 
QUESTION: Does this means, Mr. Secretary, that Russian oil companies will be allowed to work with Iraqi oil, to refining and selling? There was information that countries that did not support military operation, such as Russia, France and Germany, will get nothing in Iraq. 
SECRETARY POWELL: After we have transferred sovereignty back to the Ira q people, it will be up to the Iraqi government to determine what relations they will have with France, Germany and Russia, what economic opportunities those countries will have and what opportunities will exist for exploring for more oil or assisting the Iraqis in rebuilding their oil infrastructure. We are trying to look to the future and not the past. 
QUESTION: Concerning this, what is the American Government going to advise to the new powers in Iraq regarding the Russian companies? 
SECRETARY POWELL: America would always be available to provide advice to them, but we are waiting to put in place a transitional government next June. And then within a year after that, we would hope that the Iraqis would have had full elections for a new government, and we will wait for that new government to come into place and then discuss with them what positions they would like to take with respect to Russia or any other country. But it would be premature before that government is formed for me to suggest what they might decide or what they may agree to do. 
QUESTION: Have you discussed another difficult topic during the meeting that you had in Moscow  Iran and cooperation between Moscow and Teheran on nuclear issues. Were you able to reach a new point on this issue? 
SECRETARY POWELL: We had good discussions on the Russian civilian power plant program in Iran at Bushir. Both Russia and the United States are concerned about nuclear proliferation, and this is the area where we have been able to work with each other and with the International Atomic AgencyInternational Atomic Energy Agency- in order to get Iran to sign an additional protocol to the NPT. So I am pleased with the discussions we have had, and we have a mutual concern with respect to any proliferation activity anywhere in the world. 
QUESTION: I remind you that we have Secretary Colin Powell as our guest today. If you have a question, send them to our pager. I already have several of your questions that we got through Internet. Another issue, which is related to fighting against terrorism. They say that Osama Bin Laden is already captured, but will be shown to public only later, before the presidential elections. Is it true? 
SECRETARY POWELL: No, we do not have custody of Osama bin Laden. We are not holding him for an election surprise. [Laughter] If we had him, I can assure you, he would be shown to the world and he would be prosecuted. 
QUESTION: A question from one of our listeners, Kristina from Moscow. The obvious terror that Saddam Hussein supported in his country stopped only because of interference of other countries, and the United States in the first place. Now Moscow is destroying Chechnya with a silent agreement of the world community and the United States. Why you are not involved in this, asks Kristina. 
SECRETARY POWELL: Chechnya is a part of the Russian Federation and they are dealing with a difficult situation there. There are terrorists in Chechnya and we have said to our Russian colleagues that it is a problem they have to deal with. But we hope that they will work toward finding a political solution and that they will conduct their efforts in Chechnya in full consideration of their human rights and international obligations for the protection of human rights. But it is an internal matter for the Russian Federation to deal with. 
QUESTION: But what was happening in Iraq was its internal matter of Saddam Hussein, as well, wasnt it? Why did the United States interfere? 
SECRETARY POWELL: No because Iraq was subject to U.N. resolutions. Resolution after resolution that was passed over a period of twelve years demanding that Iraq come clean with respect to its weapons of mass destruction programs, that it stop abusing its people and to take other actions and Iraq continuously ignored the demands of the international community. And we were concerned about the weapons of mass destruction because they had used them against other nations and had used these weapons against their own people. 
QUESTION: But in the end, there was no weapons of mass destruction. 
SECRETARY POWELL: There were programs that were clearly intended to produce weapons of mass destruction. They had the intention to produce weapons of mass destruction. And we knew they had previously stockpiles. 
What we are now looking at to see whether there are still stockpiles and that is an open question. But that is why we have sent back a new Chief Inspector, Mr. Duelfer, who will be working with our experts in the area to completely look at all the sites that were there as well as examine all the documents and interview individuals to finally answer the question as to whether or not they had stockpiles. 
SECRETARY POWELL: Theres also no doubt in my mind that what Hussein was trying to do was to get the international community to stop looking at him, to get relief from all the sanctions so he could go back to his programs and develop these weapons. He never lost the intention to develop even more deadly weapons. But he is gone and the world doesnt have to worry about this anymore. 
QUESTION: Now, about some of our internal political problems. It is interesting to know your point of view. In yesterdays Izvestiya, you wrote about your first visit to the USSR many years ago the following: awful skills of the soviet regime to scare its own people and suppress any appearance of having a human spirit. Today, some people here say that those almost Stalins days are returning, and President Putting is slowly tightening the screws. (Literally: bolts) Do you agree with this? 
SECRETARY POWELL: No those days are not coming back, and I dont have the least concern about that, frankly. The Russian people now vote freely for who their leaders will be. 
We have expressed some concern to President Putin and Russian leaders that we believe that more open media, greater access to the media for people who are running for office and certain other actions that the Russian government has taken causes some concern and as friends we express that concern to our Russian colleagues. 
But when I think back over the thirty years I have been coming to Russia, what we have seen over the last fifteen years is a remarkable transformation to a democratic system of government where the people are able to vote and vote freely. But we think that more can be done here so that they have access to the information through a free media in order to make an informed choice. So I am not concerned about Russia returning to the old days from the Soviet Union, far from it. Russia has accomplished a great deal in recent years and the United States views Russia as a friend and a partner and wants to be helpful. 
SECRETARY POWELL: Most of my article in Izvestiya praised Russia for what it has accomplished, but as a friend we pointed out some area that is causing us some concern. This is how friends talk to one another. To show you how things have changed, in my own neighborhood back in the United States, the local gas station is owned by LUK Oil. Something that would have been unimaginable just a few years ago. 
QUESTION: You most likely wont see Yukos gas stations near your home, taking into account what is going on around this oil company, and its head, Mikhail Khodorkovskiy. They say in Kremlin, that it is a singular case and is not that important. Do you agree with that? 
SECRETARY POWELL: Well we are watching the case carefully and in my conversation with President Putin yesterday we talked about the need for full transparency and for those who have been accused of crimes to be dealt with in accordance with the law and acceptable rules of evidence and President Putin assured me that this case would be tried in that manner. 
QUESTION: I have several short questions. Several U.S. Congressmen suggested that Russia no longer be invited to G-8 summits. Taking into account that the U.S is going to host the summit this year, has the decision made about inviting President Putin to the summit. 
SECRETARY POWELL: Of course we would expect President Putin to be at the G8 Summit in the United States and to represent the Russian Federation. 
But the views expressed by those Congressmen reflect some of the concerns that I discussed with President Putin yesterday and were reflected in my Izvestiya article and that is why I felt it was important to raise these issues with the President. 
QUESTION: One other question which many of our listeners ask, for example, Svetlana by pager, what is the attitude of U. S. administration of weakening rate of the dollar? The dollar is not only a matter of paying but is a very serious factor of politics, not just internal politics but also external politics. Why is the value of the dollar falling? 
SECRETARY POWELL: The dollar is responding to financial market conditions and that is all I think I can say about it. As the Secretary of State, I have a very hard and fast rule, that I let the Secretary of Treasury make any comments that are going to be made about the position of the dollar. But I would say to your listeners - because I know it is a concern to them - that I consider the dollar to still be a good investment, but be patient. 
QUESTION: Do I understand correctly? That there are definitely meetings in the White House were this issue is discussed? That the U.S. administration is concerned that your currencys rate  and our ruble, not the European Euro  but yours is falling in value? 
SECRETARY POWELL: Well there are always conversations about how the exchange rate is moving and it either has the aspect of assisting exports or assisting imports, but let the markets do their work and the dollar tends to find its real value over time. 
QUESTION: Have you tried to exchange dollars to rubles here in Moscow? 
SECRETARY POWELL: I havent had the opportunity to do that or go shopping. I wish I did. [Laughter] 
QUESTION: Several more questions, in particular from Internet. Giorgi, from Tartamishin, but he states that he is from the United States. Is the U.S. going to return the base in Guantanamo to its legal owner, that is, to Cuba? And if so, when? 
SECRETARY POWELL: The base at Guantanamo is still under U.S. control and will remain so under arrangements previously entered into with Cuba. 
QUESTION: Does U.S. policy in general intend to widen its international, including military, presence? Recently, many in Moscow, among them diplomats, heard that there was information that the new U.S. base is going to be created very close to our borders, in Poland. You come to Moscow, and have conversations with President Putin as friends, but at the same time you encircle our country with new bases. 
SECRETARY POWELL: Let me start by saying that the number of troops that will be deployed in Europe will be going down, not up. And so we are trying to rearrange our presence in Europe to rationalize it in a better way.As part of that effort we may want to put some temporary facilities in some of the countries that used to be part of the Warsaw Pack, but these would not be big bases of the kind we had in Germany during the days of the Cold War. These might be small places where we could go and train for brief period of time or use air bases as access to get to dangerous places, crisis places, in Central Asia, Persian Gulf, Middle East. But it is not essentially moving our army closer to the Russian Federation and people should not see it in that light. The number of troops overall will be going down. Therefore, we are not trying to surround anyone. 
Let me put this in context because I hear this question all the time. Twelve years ago when I was head of the American Armed Forces, we had 315,000 troops in Europe. We started to draw down right after the end of the Cold War and we are going to well below 100,000. So nobody should be concerned that somehow the United States is building up its forces to be a threat to anyone or to surround any one. 
The Cold War is over. The Iron Curtain is down. Russia and the United States are now friends, not competitors or potential enemies and we should not see such things in old Cold War terms. 
QUESTION: Our time is almost over  last question. We know that yesterday, you discussed with Putin a joint space project, maybe about Mars. It is well know that the financial situation in our country is not really well. Can the United States help us with money? We have enough brains for it. 
SECRETARY POWELL: You do have an enormous technical capability to bring to the space program and as you know, we have cooperated in space and President Putin and I discussed this yesterday. I think there are new areas for cooperation, perhaps even in the new initiative that President Bush announced with respect to going to the moon and to Mars. But we are just beginning those discussions. I am confident that Russia will have a role to play. 
QUESTION: You are not going to give us any money, arent you? 
SECRETARY POWELL: Well, I cannot predict how much money might be available or how the money will be allocated. 
And the Budget Director gets very unhappy when I start to give away his money [laughter]. 
QUESTION: Thank you very much. This was the Secretary of State of the United States Collin Powell alive on Echo Moskvy. We are always glad to see you in Moscow and here in our station Ekho Moskvy. 

Released on January 27, 2004

SECRETARY POWELL: Good morning. It is good to be back.

QUESTION: We are glad to great you at this station again. It has become a good tradition to have you here during your visits to Moscow. You do not only have official negotiations but answer our questions and the questions of listeners. Taking into account that you came to Moscow from Tbilisi, our first questions are about Georgia. We know that yesterday you discussed this issue with President Putin and the Minister of Foreign Affairs Ivanov. Is it possible to tell now when the Russian military bases will be transferred from Georgia? As far as we know, this is one of the most serious questions. .

SECRETARY POWELL: I cant answer that question. That is a matter for Russian authorities and the Georgian authorities to work out through discussions and negotiations over time.

The U.S. position is that those forces should come out in accordance with the Istanbul commitments that the Russian Federation entered into in 1999.

But I was impressed by the open attitude that President Putin had toward this question yesterday when we discussed it and I know that he and Foreign Minister Ivanov will be working with the new leadership of Georgia to come up with a solution to the situation.

We wish the Georgian people all the best under their new leadership and the United States looks forward to cooperating with the Russian Federation in helping the Georgian people put in place a stable democracy.

QUESTION: To help -- does this mean in the first place with funding, doesnt it? There was information in the media, referring to a representative of the State Department, that the United States is ready to provide a certain amount of money to speed up the process of Russian troop withdrawal. How much money are we talking about? .

SECRETARY POWELL: So Georgia has many needs and we will be providing something in the neighborhood of $166 million in this fiscal year for the Georgians. And we have had some conversations with the Russian Federation about providing some financial assistance to assist in the transit of the forces out of the bases in Georgia and back into the Russian Federation, but there are no specific numbers that I could give you right now.

QUESTION: There are many hot points in the world, and in some regions Russia and the United States cooperate. However, this does not apply to Iraq. As it is well known, our country did not send its troops to Iraq. But, as far as I understand from your yesterdays meetings in Moscow, both Putin and Ivanov appear to approve of the current mission of the United States in Iraq. Is it so?

SECRETARY POWELL: Yes, we had a positive discussion about Iraq. There is no question that last year we had a serious disagreement. Russia did not support our military campaign in Iraq, but now we are cooperating to help the Iraqis build a democracy for themselves. Russia joined us in getting passage of U.N. Resolution 1511 which brought the International community back together.

Russian firms are not working in Iraq under direct contracts with Iraqi companies and Iraq authorities. And we have had discussions with Russia about debt relief for Iraq. And I think there will be further contracting opportunities and sub-contracting opportunities for Russian firms in Iraq.

QUESTION: Does this means, Mr. Secretary, that Russian oil companies will be allowed to work with Iraqi oil, to refining and selling? There was information that countries that did not support military operation, such as Russia, France and Germany, will get nothing in Iraq.

SECRETARY POWELL: After we have transferred sovereignty back to the Ira q people, it will be up to the Iraqi government to determine what relations they will have with France, Germany and Russia, what economic opportunities those countries will have and what opportunities will exist for exploring for more oil or assisting the Iraqis in rebuilding their oil infrastructure. We are trying to look to the future and not the past.

QUESTION: Concerning this, what is the American Government going to advise to the new powers in Iraq regarding the Russian companies?

SECRETARY POWELL: America would always be available to provide advice to them, but we are waiting to put in place a transitional government next June. And then within a year after that, we would hope that the Iraqis would have had full elections for a new government, and we will wait for that new government to come into place and then discuss with them what positions they would like to take with respect to Russia or any other country. But it would be premature before that government is formed for me to suggest what they might decide or what they may agree to do.

QUESTION: Have you discussed another difficult topic during the meeting that you had in Moscow  Iran and cooperation between Moscow and Teheran on nuclear issues. Were you able to reach a new point on this issue?

SECRETARY POWELL: We had good discussions on the Russian civilian power plant program in Iran at Bushir. Both Russia and the United States are concerned about nuclear proliferation, and this is the area where we have been able to work with each other and with the International Atomic AgencyInternational Atomic Energy Agency- in order to get Iran to sign an additional protocol to the NPT. So I am pleased with the discussions we have had, and we have a mutual concern with respect to any proliferation activity anywhere in the world.

QUESTION: I remind you that we have Secretary Colin Powell as our guest today. If you have a question, send them to our pager. I already have several of your questions that we got through Internet. Another issue, which is related to fighting against terrorism. They say that Osama Bin Laden is already captured, but will be shown to public only later, before the presidential elections. Is it true?

SECRETARY POWELL: No, we do not have custody of Osama bin Laden. We are not holding him for an election surprise. [Laughter] If we had him, I can assure you, he would be shown to the world and he would be prosecuted.

QUESTION: A question from one of our listeners, Kristina from Moscow. The obvious terror that Saddam Hussein supported in his country stopped only because of interference of other countries, and the United States in the first place. Now Moscow is destroying Chechnya with a silent agreement of the world community and the United States. Why you are not involved in this, asks Kristina.

SECRETARY POWELL: Chechnya is a part of the Russian Federation and they are dealing with a difficult situation there. There are terrorists in Chechnya and we have said to our Russian colleagues that it is a problem they have to deal with. But we hope that they will work toward finding a political solution and that they will conduct their efforts in Chechnya in full consideration of their human rights and international obligations for the protection of human rights. But it is an internal matter for the Russian Federation to deal with.

QUESTION: But what was happening in Iraq was its internal matter of Saddam Hussein, as well, wasnt it? Why did the United States interfere?

SECRETARY POWELL: No because Iraq was subject to U.N. resolutions. Resolution after resolution that was passed over a period of twelve years demanding that Iraq come clean with respect to its weapons of mass destruction programs, that it stop abusing its people and to take other actions and Iraq continuously ignored the demands of the international community. And we were concerned about the weapons of mass destruction because they had used them against other nations and had used these weapons against their own people.

QUESTION: But in the end, there was no weapons of mass destruction.

SECRETARY POWELL: There were programs that were clearly intended to produce weapons of mass destruction. They had the intention to produce weapons of mass destruction. And we knew they had previously stockpiles.

What we are now looking at to see whether there are still stockpiles and that is an open question. But that is why we have sent back a new Chief Inspector, Mr. Duelfer, who will be working with our experts in the area to completely look at all the sites that were there as well as examine all the documents and interview individuals to finally answer the question as to whether or not they had stockpiles.

SECRETARY POWELL: Theres also no doubt in my mind that what Hussein was trying to do was to get the international community to stop looking at him, to get relief from all the sanctions so he could go back to his programs and develop these weapons. He never lost the intention to develop even more deadly weapons. But he is gone and the world doesnt have to worry about this anymore.

QUESTION: Now, about some of our internal political problems. It is interesting to know your point of view. In yesterdays Izvestiya, you wrote about your first visit to the USSR many years ago the following: awful skills of the soviet regime to scare its own people and suppress any appearance of having a human spirit. Today, some people here say that those almost Stalins days are returning, and President Putting is slowly tightening the screws. (Literally: bolts) Do you agree with this?

SECRETARY POWELL: No those days are not coming back, and I dont have the least concern about that, frankly. The Russian people now vote freely for who their leaders will be.

We have expressed some concern to President Putin and Russian leaders that we believe that more open media, greater access to the media for people who are running for office and certain other actions that the Russian government has taken causes some concern and as friends we express that concern to our Russian colleagues.

But when I think back over the thirty years I have been coming to Russia, what we have seen over the last fifteen years is a remarkable transformation to a democratic system of government where the people are able to vote and vote freely. But we think that more can be done here so that they have access to the information through a free media in order to make an informed choice. So I am not concerned about Russia returning to the old days from the Soviet Union, far from it. Russia has accomplished a great deal in recent years and the United States views Russia as a friend and a partner and wants to be helpful.

SECRETARY POWELL: Most of my article in Izvestiya praised Russia for what it has accomplished, but as a friend we pointed out some area that is causing us some concern. This is how friends talk to one another. To show you how things have changed, in my own neighborhood back in the United States, the local gas station is owned by LUK Oil. Something that would have been unimaginable just a few years ago.

QUESTION: You most likely wont see Yukos gas stations near your home, taking into account what is going on around this oil company, and its head, Mikhail Khodorkovskiy. They say in Kremlin, that it is a singular case and is not that important. Do you agree with that?

SECRETARY POWELL: Well we are watching the case carefully and in my conversation with President Putin yesterday we talked about the need for full transparency and for those who have been accused of crimes to be dealt with in accordance with the law and acceptable rules of evidence and President Putin assured me that this case would be tried in that manner.

QUESTION: I have several short questions. Several U.S. Congressmen suggested that Russia no longer be invited to G-8 summits. Taking into account that the U.S is going to host the summit this year, has the decision made about inviting President Putin to the summit.

SECRETARY POWELL: Of course we would expect President Putin to be at the G8 Summit in the United States and to represent the Russian Federation.

But the views expressed by those Congressmen reflect some of the concerns that I discussed with President Putin yesterday and were reflected in my Izvestiya article and that is why I felt it was important to raise these issues with the President.

QUESTION: One other question which many of our listeners ask, for example, Svetlana by pager, what is the attitude of U. S. administration of weakening rate of the dollar? The dollar is not only a matter of paying but is a very serious factor of politics, not just internal politics but also external politics. Why is the value of the dollar falling?

SECRETARY POWELL: The dollar is responding to financial market conditions and that is all I think I can say about it. As the Secretary of State, I have a very hard and fast rule, that I let the Secretary of Treasury make any comments that are going to be made about the position of the dollar. But I would say to your listeners - because I know it is a concern to them - that I consider the dollar to still be a good investment, but be patient.

QUESTION: Do I understand correctly? That there are definitely meetings in the White House were this issue is discussed? That the U.S. administration is concerned that your currencys rate  and our ruble, not the European Euro  but yours is falling in value?

SECRETARY POWELL: Well there are always conversations about how the exchange rate is moving and it either has the aspect of assisting exports or assisting imports, but let the markets do their work and the dollar tends to find its real value over time.

QUESTION: Have you tried to exchange dollars to rubles here in Moscow?

SECRETARY POWELL: I havent had the opportunity to do that or go shopping. I wish I did. [Laughter]

QUESTION: Several more questions, in particular from Internet. Giorgi, from Tartamishin, but he states that he is from the United States. Is the U.S. going to return the base in Guantanamo to its legal owner, that is, to Cuba? And if so, when?

SECRETARY POWELL: The base at Guantanamo is still under U.S. control and will remain so under arrangements previously entered into with Cuba.

QUESTION: Does U.S. policy in general intend to widen its international, including military, presence? Recently, many in Moscow, among them diplomats, heard that there was information that the new U.S. base is going to be created very close to our borders, in Poland. You come to Moscow, and have conversations with President Putin as friends, but at the same time you encircle our country with new bases.

SECRETARY POWELL: Let me start by saying that the number of troops that will be deployed in Europe will be going down, not up. And so we are trying to rearrange our presence in Europe to rationalize it in a better way.As part of that effort we may want to put some temporary facilities in some of the countries that used to be part of the Warsaw Pack, but these would not be big bases of the kind we had in Germany during the days of the Cold War. These might be small places where we could go and train for brief period of time or use air bases as access to get to dangerous places, crisis places, in Central Asia, Persian Gulf, Middle East. But it is not essentially moving our army closer to the Russian Federation and people should not see it in that light. The number of troops overall will be going down. Therefore, we are not trying to surround anyone.

Let me put this in context because I hear this question all the time. Twelve years ago when I was head of the American Armed Forces, we had 315,000 troops in Europe. We started to draw down right after the end of the Cold War and we are going to well below 100,000. So nobody should be concerned that somehow the United States is building up its forces to be a threat to anyone or to surround any one.

The Cold War is over. The Iron Curtain is down. Russia and the United States are now friends, not competitors or potential enemies and we should not see such things in old Cold War terms.

QUESTION: Our time is almost over  last question. We know that yesterday, you discussed with Putin a joint space project, maybe about Mars. It is well know that the financial situation in our country is not really well. Can the United States help us with money? We have enough brains for it.

SECRETARY POWELL: You do have an enormous technical capability to bring to the space program and as you know, we have cooperated in space and President Putin and I discussed this yesterday. I think there are new areas for cooperation, perhaps even in the new initiative that President Bush announced with respect to going to the moon and to Mars. But we are just beginning those discussions. I am confident that Russia will have a role to play.

QUESTION: You are not going to give us any money, arent you?

SECRETARY POWELL: Well, I cannot predict how much money might be available or how the money will be allocated.

And the Budget Director gets very unhappy when I start to give away his money [laughter].

QUESTION: Thank you very much. This was the Secretary of State of the United States Collin Powell alive on Echo Moskvy. We are always glad to see you in Moscow and here in our station Ekho Moskvy.



",https://web.archive.org/web/20030821054856/https://2001-2009.state.gov/secretary/former/powell/remarks/28522.htm
Colin Powell,20030620,U.S. Policy on Chechnya,"Chairman Nighthorse Campbell, Co-Chairman Smith and CSCE commissioners, thank you for the invitation to speak today on Chechnya. The Administration welcomes this opportunity to discuss U.S. policy on Chechnya and the events of the past several months.
As you all know, the current conflict in Chechnya in a few months will begin its third year. Coming on the heels of the first conflict in Chechnya from 1994-1996, this latest conflict has dragged on nearly twice as long but with a similarly tragic price in human lives, peoples homes, and Chechen society. The casualties mount every day -- for both sides, Chechen and Russian alike -- and the pain and suffering of innocent civilians resulting from the fighting see no end in sight. There are few places in the world that have borne such devastation as Chechnya. Continuation of the conflict not only constitutes a drain on Russian development and a living nightmare for innocent Chechens, but it poses a threat to the entire Caucasus region.
Sadly, this tragic situation shows no signs of ending soon. The fighting goes on. Russian forces conduct sweeps, sealing towns and villages and searching house to house for fighters. Often these sweeps are subsequently followed by reports of the beatings and torture of civilians, of extortion, or the disappearances of young men. Russian convoys are ambushed daily by Chechen fighters using landmines, and Russian blockposts or administrative buildings are often attacked in hit-and-run raids. Pro-Moscow Chechen administrators are assassinated. The economy is in shambles. Housing and infrastructure are destroyed, especially in Grozny where thousands still live, struggling from day to day in the most difficult conditions.
The United States Government is committed to doing all that we can to bring about an end to this conflict and to relieve the suffering of the civilian population. Through our humanitarian assistance programs and our diplomatic efforts, the United States remains engaged on Chechnya.
Our objectives for Chechnya today are the same as they have been in the past. We seek a political settlement that will end the fighting, promote reconciliation, and recognize the territorial integrity of the Russian Federation. We also seek accountability for human rights abuses committed by all sides, and unimpeded access to the displaced by humanitarian organizations. As we have always done, we are working toward these objectives in our on-going discussions with the Russian Government, in concert with our friends and allies, and in partnership with international and non-governmental organizations.
A Political Settlement
On September 24, 2001 President Putin made a speech describing Russian readiness to assist the United States in the war on terrorism in the aftermath of September 11. But he went further on Chechnya, drawing a distinction between the ""historic roots"" of the conflict in Chechnya and the presence of foreign terrorists. We saw in this distinction the basis for the possibility that talks could begin. We were thus pleased when on September 25 Chechen leader Maskhadov welcomed President Putin's speech and opened the door for a political dialogue.
After weeks of jockeying and phone contacts, a face-to-face meeting between a Russian Government official and a Chechen representative took place in late November. Unfortunately, there have been no meetings to follow up on that, and we understand that contacts have been suspended. But as have said repeatedly, a political settlement is the only way that this conflict can be ended, peace and stability can be returned to Chechnya and the process of rebuilding can be started. Russian Government officials have noted progress in re-establishing government structures and say they are working toward ""normalizing"" the situation. Without some settlement with those forces engaged in the fighting, however, we do not believe this will be enough to end the fighting.
Clearly, the causes and motivations of Chechens fighting the Russians differ. There are those who see this as a struggle to protect their homeland. And there are others in Chechnya who have been linked to international terrorist circles.
We do not ask the Russian Government to try to reach accord with terrorists. But we do believe that there are those with whom discussions can be undertaken, such as Mr. Maskhadov -- a leader who has sufficient credibility with the broader Chechen population to speak for them in a political dialogue with Moscow. We intend to continue to make this point to the Russian Government, as we have consistently in the past, and we encourage our allies to do so as well. We hope that contacts will be resumed in the near future. However, while we see some indications of interest on the Russian side in launching a dialogue, we are not able to offer a reliable prediction as to when Russian-Chechen political contacts might be resumed.
At the same time, we have called on Mr. Maskhadov and other moderate Chechens to disassociate themselves with terrorists. Contrary to some media reporting, we have not seen evidence of extensive ties between Chechens and Al-Qaida in Chechnya, but we have seen evidence of individuals or certain factions linked to terrorist elements. A clear demonstration by Mr. Maskhadov that he does not maintain such ties is appropriate as a gesture to show he is a credible interlocutor for the Russians. And we intend to continue to make that point to the Chechens as well.
We have taken action on this point. Some Chechen forces with links to international terrorists are supported through groups operating in the Pankisi Gorge in Georgia, which borders Chechnya. Last fall, Russian aircraft conducted several air strikes against the Pankisi Gorge. While we agree that the Russians have a legitimate concern, we have urged them not to take action themselves. Instead, we are working with President Shevardnadze and the Georgian Government to train and equip Georgian military units, so that Georgia will have the capacity to deal with this problem itself.
Despite the death of field commander Khattab, an Arab linked to terrorists and commander of the foreign mujahidin in Chechnya, and the rumored death of field commander Shamil Basayev, another of those linked to terrorists, the conflict is likely to continue at its present level. We believe that more than one thousand Chechen fighters remain. The Chechens' ability to recruit new fighters is aided in part by the animosity created by the harsh tactics of Russian security forces. As we have said repeatedly and continue to believe, there is no military solution to this conflict.
The Humanitarian Situation
An estimated 300,000 Chechens have been displaced by the fighting. More than half of the displaced -- 160,000 -- remain in Chechnya. The displaced account for more a third of Chechnya's estimated population of 440,000. Of the rest, the largest concentration is in Ingushetiya, with others in Dagestan and other areas of Russia, or in Georgia, Azerbaijan or Kazakhstan. The United Nations estimates that 140,000 Chechens are in Ingushetiya now, and 65 percent of them are living in private homes, with relatives or others who would take them in. The rest live in camps or spontaneous settlements. These people are largely dependent on aid provided by the international community.
The United States has been the largest single provider of humanitarian aid to the North Caucasus. Since 1999 we have contributed more than 30 million dollars, an amount that is roughly a quarter of all aid given under the United Nation's consolidated humanitarian appeals. In FY2001, the United States contributed a total of 22.1 million dollars to the United Nations and its agencies, to the International Committee of the Red Cross, and non-governmental organizations. Included in that sum is 9.6 million dollars of monies earmarked by Congress for American non-governmental organizations to carry out projects in the region.
Much of contribution has been in the form of food aid, such as wheat, flour and cooking oil. In FY2001, our funds helped feed 335,000 people. Our contributions also have funded much needed emergency health care, water and sanitation projects, education and shelter, as well as mine awareness programs. All of our contributions, except earmarked funds, are provided directly to the UN and the Red Cross for distribution through their agencies and implementing partners.
Beyond our contributions, we have assigned a refugee coordinator to our Embassy in Moscow who works with the international community and Russian officials in the delivery of our humanitarian assistance and reporting on further needs. The coordinator is a liaison with international and non-governmental organizations working in the field and federal and local governments. The coordinator also serves to monitor the situation on the ground, to observe the plight of the displaced and to identify where U.S. assistance programs should best be targeted.
In the North Caucasus, the security situation makes access to the region difficult. As you may know, there is a ban on U.S. Government personnel traveling to the region without the specific permission of the U.S. Ambassador to Russia. But the priority we place on the humanitarian situation has required that we send our refugee coordinator to the region on several trips.
Our policy has emphasized that humanitarian organizations be given the necessary, unimpeded access to the region to reach the displaced. The Russian Government has generally provided this access for the delivery of relief, but there have been occasional problems with changing administrative requirements and lack of coordination by Russian federal authorities and the local Chechen administration. The security situation in Chechnya makes delivery of humanitarian assistance particularly difficult, however.
We have also stressed in our discussions with the Russian Government that the return of the displaced to Chechnya be voluntary. Russian authorities have assured us that is the case, but the local pro-Moscow Chechen administration has undertaken a campaign to convince the displaced to return. As long as the security situation shows no improvement, however, most will not. In addition, Moscow has cut payments to the government of Ingushetiya that had been used to support benefits to displaced Chechens. The cuts in food and other programs in Ingushetiya create pressure on Chechens to return despite the risky security situation. Finally, the Russian government has suspended registration of new displaced persons in Ingushetiya since February 2001, making new arrivals ineligible for social benefits  food, housing, even education for their children.
Human Rights
The danger to civilians in Chechnya remains our greatest concern. The human rights situation is poor, with a history of abuses by all sides and little or no accountability by either. As we discuss in detail in our most recent human rights report, and as both Russian and international human rights NGOs have reported, civilians in Grozny and other towns and villages in areas where there is rebel activity are subject to security sweeps, or zachistki, by Russian forces.
These sweeps may be planned or occur spontaneously if Russian troops in the area are attacked. The result is that the village is sealed off and troops conduct house to house searches, checking identity documents. Usually, these sweeps are swiftly followed by new reports of serious human rights abuses, such as summary execution, arbitrary detention, torture, beatings, or extortion. Frequently, some of those taken into detention disappear, and sometimes their bodies are found days later. There are reports of rape. According to the Russian human rights group Memorial, at least 600 people have disappeared since the conflict began, although Russian official statistics put the total reports of disappearances between 1,200 and 2,000.
Russian officials have acknowledged that Russian soldiers have committed crimes against civilians, but investigations and prosecutions have not kept pace with the scope of the human rights violations that have been reported. Russian commanders in Chechnya have issued orders intended to prevent these abuses. Under these orders, sweeps may only be conducted with the permission of the Russian commander in Chechnya, General Moltenskoi. Vehicles are to be clearly marked, and troops are to identify themselves before entering homes. Masks are not to be worn. Lists of detainees are to be circulated to local civilian administrators. But it appears that these orders have not been effectively implemented. Much more needs to be done to instill discipline in Russian security forces, to prevent abuses, and to prosecute those who commit them.
Publicly and privately, we have made this point to the Russian Government at all levels. As the Secretary said in his recent testimony before House and Senate, ""We have not forgotten about Russian abuses of human rights. We raise Chechnya at every opportunity."" The conduct of Russian forces in Chechnya must be improved. That is why we again supported the resolution on Chechnya before the United Nations Commission on Human Rights this year. The rights of the civilian population must be respected. In his recent State of the Federation speech, President Putin said that ""Everyone resident in Chechnya or originally from there must feel they are full citizens of the Russian Federation.""
The Chechen fighters are not without blame. There have been repeated attacks on local officials who work for the pro-Moscow Chechen Administration. The landmines and other explosives fighters have used against convoys have also wounded, maimed or killed innocent civilians. There are other reports of kidnapping and execution of Russian prisoners held hostage. Chechen fighters must also be held to account.
Chechnya and U.S.-Russian Relations
Russia is cooperating with us in the war on terrorism, and we are embarked on building a new, more cooperative bilateral relationship. President Putin has made clear that he sees a partnership with the United States and the West as the best course for Russia. President Bush has made clear that partnership with Russia is in our interest.
In just two weeks, Presidents Bush and Putin will meet in Moscow to discuss how to further strengthen relations between our two countries. We hope that they will be able to record concrete progress on a number of parts of the bilateral agenda, including security issues, economic relations and people-to-people exchanges.
As part of this new relationship, however, there remain issues on which we disagree. Chechnya is one of those issues, and it is an issue that we have raised regularly and candidly with the Russians. President Bush discussed it with President Putin in November, as did Secretary Powell with President Putin in Moscow in December. In the last two weeks, Chechnya has figured prominently on the agenda during Deputy Secretary Armitage's discussions in Moscow with Deputy Foreign Minister Trubnikov and during the meeting last Friday between Secretary Powell and Foreign Minister Ivanov. As we embrace this opportunity we now have to build a stronger relationship with Russia, we do so without compromising our principles and commitments to promote peace and the strengthening of human rights in Chechnya.

Chairman Nighthorse Campbell, Co-Chairman Smith and CSCE commissioners, thank you for the invitation to speak today on Chechnya. The Administration welcomes this opportunity to discuss U.S. policy on Chechnya and the events of the past several months.

As you all know, the current conflict in Chechnya in a few months will begin its third year.

We have taken action on this point. Some Chechen forces with links to international terrorists are supported through groups operating in the Pankisi Gorge in Georgia, which borders Chechnya. Last fall, Russian aircraft conducted several air strikes against the Pankisi Gorge. While we agree that the Russians have a legitimate concern, we have urged them not to take action themselves. Instead, we are working with President Shevardnadze and the Georgian Government to train and equip Georgian military units, so that Georgia will have the capacity to deal with this problem itself.

Despite the death of field commander Khattab, an Arab linked to terrorists and commander of the foreign mujahidin in Chechnya, and the rumored death of field commander Shamil Basayev, another of those linked to terrorists, the conflict is likely to continue at its present level. We believe that more than one thousand Chechen fighters remain. The Chechens' ability to recruit new fighters is aided in part by the animosity created by the harsh tactics of Russian security forces. As we have said repeatedly and continue to believe, there is no military solution to this conflict.

The Humanitarian Situation

An estimated 300,000 Chechens have been displaced by the fighting. More than half of the displaced -- 160,000 -- remain in Chechnya. The displaced account for more a third of Chechnya's estimated population of 440,000. Of the rest, the largest concentration is in Ingushetiya, with others in Dagestan and other areas of Russia, or in Georgia, Azerbaijan or Kazakhstan. The United Nations estimates that 140,000 Chechens are in Ingushetiya now, and 65 percent of them are living in private homes, with relatives or others who would take them in. The rest live in camps or spontaneous settlements. These people are largely dependent on aid provided by the international community.

The United States has been the largest single provider of humanitarian aid to the North Caucasus. Since 1999 we have contributed more than 30 million dollars, an amount that is roughly a quarter of all aid given under the United Nation's consolidated humanitarian appeals. In FY2001, the United States contributed a total of 22.1 million dollars to the United Nations and its agencies, to the International Committee of the Red Cross, and non-governmental organizations. Included in that sum is 9.6 million dollars of monies earmarked by Congress for American non-governmental organizations to carry out projects in the region.

Much of contribution has been in the form of food aid, such as wheat, flour and cooking oil. In FY2001, our funds helped feed 335,000 people. Our contributions also have funded much needed emergency health care, water and sanitation projects, education and shelter, as well as mine awareness programs. All of our contributions, except earmarked funds, are provided directly to the UN and the Red Cross for distribution through their agencies and implementing partners.

Beyond our contributions, we have assigned a refugee coordinator to our Embassy in Moscow who works with the international community and Russian officials in the delivery of our humanitarian assistance and reporting on further needs. The coordinator is a liaison with international and non-governmental organizations working in the field and federal and local governments. The coordinator also serves to monitor the situation on the ground, to observe the plight of the displaced and to identify where U.S. assistance programs should best be targeted.

In the North Caucasus, the security situation makes access to the region difficult. As you may know, there is a ban on U.S. Government personnel traveling to the region without the specific permission of the U.S. Ambassador to Russia. But the priority we place on the humanitarian situation has required that we send our refugee coordinator to the region on several trips.

Our policy has emphasized that humanitarian organizations be given the necessary, unimpeded access to the region to reach the displaced. The Russian Government has generally provided this access for the delivery of relief, but there have been occasional problems with changing administrative requirements and lack of coordination by Russian federal authorities and the local Chechen administration. The security situation in Chechnya makes delivery of humanitarian assistance particularly difficult, however.

We have also stressed in our discussions with the Russian Government that the return of the displaced to Chechnya be voluntary. Russian authorities have assured us that is the case, but the local pro-Moscow Chechen administration has undertaken a campaign to convince the displaced to return. As long as the security situation shows no improvement, however, most will not. In addition, Moscow has cut payments to the government of Ingushetiya that had been used to support benefits to displaced Chechens. The cuts in food and other programs in Ingushetiya create pressure on Chechens to return despite the risky security situation. Finally, the Russian government has suspended registration of new displaced persons in Ingushetiya since February 2001, making new arrivals ineligible for social benefits  food, housing, even education for their children.

Human Rights

The danger to civilians in Chechnya remains our greatest concern. The human rights situation is poor, with a history of abuses by all sides and little or no accountability by either. As we discuss in detail in our most recent human rights report, and as both Russian and international human rights NGOs have reported, civilians in Grozny and other towns and villages in areas where there is rebel activity are subject to security sweeps, or zachistki, by Russian forces.

These sweeps may be planned or occur spontaneously if Russian troops in the area are attacked. The result is that the village is sealed off and troops conduct house to house searches, checking identity documents. Usually, these sweeps are swiftly followed by new reports of serious human rights abuses, such as summary execution, arbitrary detention, torture, beatings, or extortion. Frequently, some of those taken into detention disappear, and sometimes their bodies are found days later. There are reports of rape. According to the Russian human rights group Memorial, at least 600 people have disappeared since the conflict began, although Russian official statistics put the total reports of disappearances between 1,200 and 2,000.

Russian officials have acknowledged that Russian soldiers have committed crimes against civilians, but investigations and prosecutions have not kept pace with the scope of the human rights violations that have been reported. Russian commanders in Chechnya have issued orders intended to prevent these abuses. Under these orders, sweeps may only be conducted with the permission of the Russian commander in Chechnya, General Moltenskoi. Vehicles are to be clearly marked, and troops are to identify themselves before entering homes. Masks are not to be worn. Lists of detainees are to be circulated to local civilian administrators. But it appears that these orders have not been effectively implemented. Much more needs to be done to instill discipline in Russian security forces, to prevent abuses, and to prosecute those who commit them.

Publicly and privately, we have made this point to the Russian Government at all levels. As the Secretary said in his recent testimony before House and Senate, ""We have not forgotten about Russian abuses of human rights. We raise Chechnya at every opportunity."" The conduct of Russian forces in Chechnya must be improved. That is why we again supported the resolution on Chechnya before the United Nations Commission on Human Rights this year. The rights of the civilian population must be respected. In his recent State of the Federation speech, President Putin said that ""Everyone resident in Chechnya or originally from there must feel they are full citizens of the Russian Federation.""

The Chechen fighters are not without blame. There have been repeated attacks on local officials who work for the pro-Moscow Chechen Administration. The landmines and other explosives fighters have used against convoys have also wounded, maimed or killed innocent civilians. There are other reports of kidnapping and execution of Russian prisoners held hostage. Chechen fighters must also be held to account.

Chechnya and U.S.-Russian Relations

Russia is cooperating with us in the war on terrorism, and we are embarked on building a new, more cooperative bilateral relationship. President Putin has made clear that he sees a partnership with the United States and the West as the best course for Russia. President Bush has made clear that partnership with Russia is in our interest.

In just two weeks, Presidents Bush and Putin will meet in Moscow to discuss how to further strengthen relations between our two countries. We hope that they will be able to record concrete progress on a number of parts of the bilateral agenda, including security issues, economic relations and people-to-people exchanges.

As part of this new relationship, however, there remain issues on which we disagree. Chechnya is one of those issues, and it is an issue that we have raised regularly and candidly with the Russians. President Bush discussed it with President Putin in November, as did Secretary Powell with President Putin in Moscow in December. In the last two weeks, Chechnya has figured prominently on the agenda during Deputy Secretary Armitage's discussions in Moscow with Deputy Foreign Minister Trubnikov and during the meeting last Friday between Secretary Powell and Foreign Minister Ivanov. As we embrace this opportunity we now have to build a stronger relationship with Russia, we do so without compromising our principles and commitments to promote peace and the strengthening of human rights in Chechnya.

Colin Powell,20020926,Press Briefing Aboard Aircraft En Route To Shanghai,"SECRETARY POWELL: Who wants first?
QUESTION: (Inaudible.)
SECRETARY POWELL: I have been talking with my staff back in Washington and they have been in touch with both sides. The Palestinian Authority put out a strong statement condemning the assassination. At the time they put it out it was still an assassination attempt because the minister hadnt died but he has subsequently died. So, it is a very serious situation and Ill make additional calls when I land. Our Consul General in Jerusalem is in direct touch as well as Ambassador Kurtzer. My staff is following it in Washington. I have been in touch with some foreign leaders already  Minister Fischer. Ill be doing more calls when I get on the ground.
QUESTION: (Inaudible.)
SECRETARY POWELL: Well, Ill wait and see. Ill get on the ground and get recommendations from my staff, get the state of play and then Ill make my judgments.
QUESTION: Are you hoping to close a deal with the Russians on this trip on ABM amendments so that it can get done before the two presidents meet?
SECRETARY POWELL: I think were going to have good discussions and a number of things have been teed up for my conversations with Igor Ivanov tomorrow night and for the presidents conversations with Mr. Putin on Sunday, but I would not expect that we would arrive at closure on the strategic framework issues on this trip. But, certainly, well be moving the ball quite a bit further down the field before approaching Crawford in about three weeks time, I guess or almost a month later. 
QUESTION: Could you say anything about what is teed up? What do you mean by --
SECRETARY POWELL: We have had a number of meetings and exchanges with the Russians on the strategic framework and the issues within the strategic framework. I dont have anything that I want to announce tonight or say tonight with respect to what they may be talking about on Sunday which you will hear from them.
QUESTION: We know that the last meeting with the Chinese was disappointing on proliferation issues. Are you going to be talking with them on this? And, how do you expect to push them on this issue without their going to be a little bit more productive on this ahead of the Presidents visit there?
SECRETARY POWELL: Her question has to do principally with the November agreement of last year, and we have been in discussions with the Chinese ever since my visit. Now what needs to be done to satisfy that agreement, the grandfathering issue, the issue of export controls, and the issue having to do with our ability to waive certain sanctions in order for them to go forward with the satellite purchases. We have not received satisfaction and, in fact, as a result of that we imposed sanctions on one of their companies, as you recall, SEMAC, a few weeks back. There has been no additional progress, and I am sure its something that I will find time to discuss with my Chinese colleagues.
QUESTION: (Inaudible.)
SECRETARY POWELL: We talked about it before and sometimes you just keep working on a problem, keep chipping away and ultimately you hope that you arrive at a solution. So, well keep working on it but we have not abandoned the position that we have taken because we think that the elements in an agreement are important. If they want to move forward with respect to that kind of technology from us those conditions have to be met.
QUESTION: What concrete steps do you hope will come out of tomorrows terrorism roundtable among APEC foreign ministers?
SECRETARY POWELL: I think we will have a good breakfast discussion, and then as you know statements are being prepared for the leaders. I think well come out with a pretty strong joint statement that will reflect the cohesion of the coalition, that it is standing together in this time of crisis. I have detected no weakening in the political commitment that leaders have made. I think that the discussions at APEC both at ministerial and at leaders level will reflect that and will be reflected in the statements that will come out. 
QUESTION: Just to follow up, what will you be looking for in terms of contributions to the campaign against terrorism and also toward a future in Afghanistan?
SECRETARY POWELL: As you know, every nation is making a contribution in a way that is appropriate for them. In some cases it is just diplomatic and political support and in other cases its a contribution of military forces. The Australians made a very strong statement by their commitment of military forces which Prime Minister Howard, I think it was yesterday or today, I cant recall, Im losing what day we are in. 
Most of the arrangements that we make like that are bilateral or within the NATO context. I dont know that we have any specific requests to put before any of the nations that will be here that we have not already put before them. Im not expecting any significant additional announcements of troop contributions or other elements of support that we are not already aware of, but my Pentagon colleagues are hard at work while I have been traveling through south Asia. If something comes up I will be sure to let you know.
QUESTION: Arent these statements already done? So what do you talk about? Similar to OAS and UN, etc?
SECRETARY POWELL: No, you would be surprised. You can get very intense discussions on the statement and whether or not someone wants to make a modification or a change to the statement. Most of the diplomatic conferences Ive gone to involve not the whole statement, but a sentence in the statement or a word in the statement or the shaping of a statement. I think well have a chance to talk.
QUESTION: So youre heading to East Asia. Months ago you were very confident that North Korea would come around, that you would open discussions with them. That was more than four months ago. Do you expect that the issue will come up? And, what do you suppose is going through the North Korean minds these days in four months without a response.
SECRETARY POWELL: I think eventually the North Koreans will respond in a way that will allow us to go forward because I dont think they have any other choice or future. Their economy doesnt get any better. Their agricultural situation doesnt get any better. I cannot predict when they will make that decision and I cannot pretend to get inside the mind of the leadership circle or the mind of Kim Jong Il. So we will have to wait and see. 
I think perhaps the events of the 11th of September have caused them to slow down their decision process. As you know, they are on a list of states that sponsor terrorism and I think things were slowed down by the events of the 11th of September. I will look forward to the discussions that the President will have with President Kim Dae Jung. Maybe we will get some better insight into North Korean thinking. As you know, they have also pulled back on some of the commitments they have made to the South Koreans with respect to travel back and forth. There is something churning going on. 
In dealing with the North Koreans its going to be a long-term, slow process but I think it has to move in a positive direction because of the severe needs that exist within that country.
QUESTION: On a step from A to Z, if A in Afghanistan is this political vacuum that you fear and Z is some sort of functioning parliament, whatever broad-based government you form, Id like to know what youre thinking about how you get from A to Z?
SECRETARY POWELL: We may see a political vacuum immediately or sort of a deteriorating situation that leads to a political vacuum. And I think what you are going to need, as I said before, is some sort of broad-based assemblage of individuals and leaders representing all aspects of Afghan society who will come together with a common purpose and perhaps using the position of the king as a rallying point and, from that, let them come up with some ideas of how they wish to be governed in the future. Then use the United Nations as the facilitating body that will help them go back into the country. Provide a sense of order and have the UN perhaps perform some interim role as they are organizing themselves and gathering their strength and developing the capability they need to govern themselves. 
Its not something that the United States or any other nation is going to be able to dictate. I think its something that we have to help them with, something that we have to help them get organized, support, and use international bodies as has been used in the past in other situations, Cambodia, East Timor, not that those are models. This one is rather unique. The UN has experience in doing this kind of thing and Mr. Brahimi is quite experienced in this regard as well.
QUESTION: On Chechnya, there have been a number of interesting statements, ambivalent developments in the past few weeks. What do you expect you will be saying to Igor Ivanov tomorrow evening about Chechnya?
SECRETARY POWELL: I think we will be encouraging them as we have in the past to seek a political solution, to move aggressively toward a political solution and to not think that it can be solved militarily. Once again to recognize that even though we are anxious to work with them and we recognize that they have to fight terrorist activities in Chechnya, they have to do it in a way that reflects a solid consideration of human rights and accountability for past atrocities that we know took place. Not every Chechen who is in a resistance mode is necessarily a terrorist. We have to make some distinctions and judgments and ultimately the only way it can be sorted out and brought to ground is with a political solution. 
QUESTION: You leave South Asia having wrapped up the framework for opposed help on government. What happens next in specific terms? And, secondly, now can you reflect a little bit on Iran and say that they will be part of the coalition or help you and the fact that you know have all the countries around Afghanistan playing a set role?
SECRETARY POWELL: What was the first question? You know, the military campaign will continue, and we hope that all the pressure that is being brought to bear on the Taliban will produce results as soon as possible. 
QUESTION: Whats next for you to do?
SECRETARY POWELL: For me to do? We are pushing in on all fronts. We are working on the military campaign. Im continuing to work with coalition members to see if there are more things that they can do and to encourage them to remain steadfast and they are doing so. I will be also working with the United Nations with respect to the question asked earlier about how we create a grouping that can come together. I will be spending time on the humanitarian issue because winter is approaching. Ramadan is approaching. Also, thinking not just about humanitarian relief but beyond that, the rebuilding of Afghanistan. Helping these people to reconstruct a life for themselves. This isnt the United States going in and nation-building with troops. This is helping the international community helping the people of Afghanistan to create hopeful conditions within the country so that they are not vulnerable to this kind of a threat again in the future.
QUESTION: What about Iran?
SECRETARY POWELL: Iran has always been hostile toward the Taliban and as you know we have been in touch with them through various channels and we are exchanging some ideas and information. I think you saw an administration spokesman indicate that they have even indicated to us that they would be willing to perform and ready to perform search and rescue missions. I dont think that will become necessary because I cant envision us needing it in that part of the theater but that was an interesting statement on their part. 
When you go from Iran and clockwise around Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Pakistan and come all the way around, they are surrounded with no friends in that surrounding neighborhood as my Indian colleague liked to call it. I think this has been putting incredible pressure on this regime. We are going after their money. It will be hard to find it all but Im sure thats having an effect already. They are being subjected to a military campaign and well just keep squeezing.
QUESTION: Are there examples of what the UN has been able to do in the past?
SECRETARY POWELL: East Timor and Cambodia are examples of what the UN has done in the past but I would not say that is a model that you would say, I would use the Cambodian model or the East Timoran model in Afghanistan. I think it is quite different. It shows, East Timor, Cambodia, or you can go to Bosnia or Kosovo, you can look at all of the previous examples. 
The UN has quite a great deal of experience in going in and helping with this kind of a situation. Cambodia, they went into absolute chaos. They had a king. I dont want to give you the impression that we are going to take the Cambodian model because there was a king there and there is a king here, and therefore thats the model. Im just saying there are examples of the UN having successfully done this kind of thing in the past, and therefore they bring qualifications to this kind of situation to do it again in the future. Im not suggesting that any one of the countries I mentioned is a model for Afghanistan. 
QUESTION: (Inaudible.)
SECRETARY POWELL: I think there probably will be a role for peacekeepers of some kind and that is part of our discussions.

SECRETARY POWELL: Who wants first?

QUESTION: (Inaudible.)

SECRETARY POWELL: I have been talking with my staff back in Washington and they have been in touch with both sides. The Palestinian Authority put out a strong statement condemning the assassination.

When most people think about U.S. foreign policy these days, they think first and sometimes only about aspects of the war on terrorism: the Reconstruction of Iraq and Afghanistan, the troubles of the Middle East, and the terror cells lurking in Southeast Asia, Europe, and even the United States. This preoccupation is natural. International terrorism literally hit home on September 11, 2001, and, for understandable reasons, an outraged American public wants those responsible brought to justice. The American people also want to understand why the attacks happened -- and demand a foreign policy that makes sure such events will never happen again. 
It is also natural that the war on terrorism has become the United States' number one foreign policy priority. It will remain so for as long as necessary, because terrorism -- potentially linked to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) -- now represents the greatest threat to American lives. Defeating terrorism is a priority that drives not only military action to subdue individual terrorists and deter their state supporters but also multilateral cooperation in law enforcement and intelligence sharing. It encompasses efforts both to stigmatize terrorism as a political instrument and to reduce the underlying sources of terrorist motivation and recruitment. 
But the breadth of U.S. strategy transcends the war on terrorism. Indeed, a strategy limited to dealing with immediate threats would in the end fail to defeat them -- just as bailing water out of a boat would not fix a leak. The sharp focus on the front lines of the war against terrorism, however, has made it harder than usual for people to grasp what American strategy is really all about. We all know the old aphorism that you can lead a horse to water but you can't make it drink. These days, it seems that an administration can develop a sound foreign policy strategy, but it can't get some people to acknowledge or understand it. 
President Bush's Vision 
It is an unfailingly effective applause line for critics of any U.S. administration to charge that the president has no vision for the world, that he has no strategy. Every trouble is attributed to this failing, as though the world would otherwise be perfectly accommodating to U.S. purposes. Unfortunately, this criticism has come close to being true in some administrations. But it is not true in the present one. President George W. Bush does have a vision of a better world. And he also has a strategy for translating that vision into reality. I know -- I was present at its creation. 
The president's strategy was first laid out publicly in September 2002, in the National Security Strategy of the United States (NSS). A succinct document of fewer than 40 pages, the NSS defines U.S. policy priorities in eight substantive sections. Together, these parts add up to an integrated strategy that is broad and deep, far ranging and forward looking, attuned as much to opportunities for the United States as to the dangers it faces. 
Of course, a public strategy document cannot be entirely frank about all the choices that U.S. leaders make; we do ourselves and our allies no favors by telling our adversaries everything that we think and plan. Nonetheless, this administration's public pronouncements have been remarkably candid. They reflect the personality of the president himself, a man who, with great consistency, says what he means and means what he says. 
It is somewhat odd, therefore, to discover that our foreign policy strategy is so often misunderstood by both domestic and foreign observers. U.S. strategy is widely accused of being unilateralist by design. It isn't. It is often accused of being imbalanced in favor of military methods. It isn't. It is frequently described as being obsessed with terrorism and hence biased toward preemptive war on a global scale. It most certainly is not. 
These distortions are partly explained by context. The NSS made the concept of preemption explicit in the heady aftermath of September 11, and it did so for obvious reasons. One reason was to reassure the American people that the government possessed common sense. As President Bush has said -- and as any sensible person understands -- if you recognize a clear and present threat that is undeterrable by the means you have at hand, then you must deal with it. You do not wait for it to strike; you do not allow future attacks to happen before you take action. 
A second reason for including the notion of preemption in the NSS was to convey to our adversaries that they were in big trouble. Instilling a certain amount of anxiety in terrorist groups increases the likelihood they will cease activity or make mistakes and be caught. Moreover, some states have been complicit in terrorism not for ideological reasons but for opportunistic ones. It was worth putting the leaders of such countries on notice that the potential costs of their opportunism had just gone way up. 
Sensible as these reasons are, some observers have exaggerated both the scope of preemption in foreign policy and the centrality of preemption in U.S. strategy as a whole. As to preemption's scope, it applies only to undeterrable threats such as those that come from nonstate actors like terrorist groups. It was never meant to displace deterrence, only to supplement it. As to its being central, it isn't. The discussion of preemption in the NSS takes up just two sentences in one of the document's eight sections. 
Some at home have distorted the NSS for partisan reasons, attempting to make the Bush administration look bad by turning fear of preemption into an early twenty-first-century equivalent of the Cold War era's ""rocket rattle."" Some abroad, meanwhile, have distorted U.S. intentions through an apparent exercise in mirror imaging. Using their own mottled political histories as a reference point, they have asked what they would do with the power that the United States possesses and have mistakenly projected their own Hobbesian intentions onto our rather more Lockean sensibilities. 
But however it has happened, the distortion of U.S. foreign policy strategy requires repair. This distortion does a disservice to honest observers trying to understand U.S. policy, and it contributes to irrational partisanship. 
The Primacy of Partnerships 
The United States' National Security Strategy does commit us to preemption under certain limited circumstances. We stand by that judgment, the novelty of which lies less in its substance than in its explicitness. But our strategy is not defined by preemption. Above all, the president's strategy is one of partnerships that strongly affirms the vital role of NATO and other U.S. alliances -- including the un. 
Don't believe it? Perhaps this is because the commentariat widely claimed that the president's recent decision to seek a new UN Security Council resolution on the postwar reconstruction of Iraq was a sharp break with policy. To think this, one would have to ignore the fact that President Bush went before the UN September 12, 2002, to make his case for the un's enforcing its own resolutions (16 of them in total); that Security Council Resolution 1441 -- which warned the Iraqi regime to comply with its own obligations under previous UN resolutions -- passed unanimously in November 2002; that we tried for a further resolution to unite the international community in the months before Operation Iraqi Freedom began; that we went to the UN in May 2003 after Operation Iraqi Freedom to secure Resolution 1483, lifting sanctions against Iraq that had become obsolete; and that we sought and secured Resolution 1500 in August, recognizing the Iraqi Governing Council. 
Had we not done all of these things, month after month, the president's decision to go to the UN Security Council in September 2003 -- and to persevere in his efforts until Resolution 1511 was approved by a 15-0 vote on October 16 -- would have been a significant departure from policy. But the administration did do all of these things. Indeed, it would have been a departure from policy not to go to the UN when, in our judgment, the next phase of Iraqi reconstruction was at hand. If there has been any departure here, it is the commentariat's departure from the basic rules of logic. 
Partnership is the watchword of U.S. strategy in this administration. Partnership is not about deferring to others; it is about working with them. Beyond upholding the partnerships we have inherited, the president seeks new ones to deal with new challenges. Some are global in scope, such as the Global Fund for HIV/AIDS. Others are regional, such as the Middle East Partnership Initiative, which provides assistance for educational, economic, and political reform throughout the Arab world. 
Beyond partnership comes principle. The president's strategy is rooted, above all, in the promotion of freedom and dignity worldwide. ""America must stand firmly,"" the president wrote, ""for the non-negotiable demands of human dignity: the rule of law; limits on the absolute power of the state; free speech; freedom of worship; equal justice; respect for women; religious and ethnic tolerance; and respect for private property."" We stand by these values now and always. They are the values served by the partnerships that we build and nurture. 
Free trade and new American initiatives for economic development also figure prominently in the president's strategy. The Free Trade Area of the Americas, the expanded Africa Growth and Opportunity Act, and especially the Millennium Challenge Account are our policy vanguards in this area. Our efforts to control the proliferation of wmd also form part of the president's strategy. These efforts led to the Proliferation Security Initiative in May 2003, an 11-nation effort to seize materials related to wmd in transit to countries of concern. In September 2003, signatories were able to agree on basic implementation guidelines, and in the president's address to the UN General Assembly on September 24, he called other nations to join. I hope they will heed his invitation. 

President Bush's strategy also demands that we play a role in helping to solve regional conflicts. Not only do such conflicts cause much suffering, but they can also spread to envelop societies now at peace and can stoke the fires of terrorism. Nowhere is the U.S. role in helping to resolve regional conflicts more important than in bringing Israelis and Palestinians to a stable peace settlement. We are obviously not there yet, but this administration's policies have brought peace closer. 
The Bush administration was widely criticized during its first two years in office for not being more active in solving the Arab-Israeli conflict. To many, ""more active"" meant spending presidential and secretarial capital on state visits and photo opportunities, as if nearly a decade of such activity had not already been tried without managing to resolve the conflict. But diplomacy can take other, more appropriate forms. In reality, we have worked hard on advancing peace, if often quietly, making the proper analysis of the situation and determining our tactics accordingly. 
As a result, we created the Quartet -- another partnership -- made up of the United States, the European Union, Russia, and the un. We developed the ""road map"" out of this partnership, and the president went to Aqaba, Jordan, in June 2003 to commit the parties to it. 
Most important, we recognized that there needed to be fundamental reform inside the Palestinian Authority if the forces for peace among Palestinians were to prevail. After it became clear that the United States would not obstruct Israel's efforts to defend itself from Palestinian terrorism, pressures for genuine reform grew within the Palestinian community. This convergence produced the hopeful premiership of Mahmoud Abbas. 
Unfortunately, Abbas' efforts were aborted by Chairman Yasir Arafat, and Abbas' successor, Ahmed Qurei, has been obstructed as well. Chairman Arafat has not been a genuine interlocutor for peace, but he has been an obstacle to it. Although our hopes for progress have been temporarily disappointed, it is now clear to all where the real problem lies. One way or another, we are bound eventually to get past this problem. Moreover, there is now a solid and growing constituency in Israel that supports prominent Palestinian leaders who genuinely seek an honorable and stable peace. Bleak as things often seem in this conflict, this does represent progress. 
Conflicts in other regions have also demanded our attention -- and our compassion. The United States has not turned away from the suffering of the Liberian people, and we have been actively trying to end strife in Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Nor have we forgotten the need for continued progress in the Balkans, in Northern Ireland, and in East Timor. We are making progress in most if not all of these areas, and we are often doing so by supporting other governments that are taking the lead. In other words, we are working as a partner. 
An Age of Cooperation 
Not least among the policy priorities laid out in the NSS is our determination to develop cooperative relations among the world's major powers. It is here, above all, that the key to a successful conclusion to the war against terrorism lies. 
To say that the world has changed is a truism: the world, after all, is always changing. It is not so trivial, however, to specify just how it has changed. As I see it, the critical tipping point of recent years was the evening of November 9, 1989. That date is when the Berlin Wall was first breached, never to be repaired, marking the end of the Cold War and, before long, of the Soviet Union itself. These events, in turn, ended the epoch of intense struggle between liberty and totalitarianism that had shaped most of the twentieth century. 
The president grasps the importance of these momentous events. As he wrote in the NSS, ""today, the international community has the best chance since the rise of the nation-state in the seventeenth century to build a world where great powers compete in peace instead of continually prepare for war. Today, the world's great powers find ourselves on the same side."" 
This development is not just good news; it is revolutionary news. For too many years -- too many centuries -- the imperial habits of great powers squandered untold resources and talent by jousting for land, glory, and gold. The futility of such habits has become evident in the twenty-first century. The possession of vast territory, raw physical resources, and brute power guarantees neither prosperity nor peace. Investment in human capital, social trust, trade, and cooperation within and among nations does. 
The sources of national strength and security for one nation thus need no longer threaten the security of others. An insight of the Enlightenment and a deep belief of the American founders -- that politics need not always be a zero-sum competition -- has at last been adopted by enough people worldwide to promise a qualitative difference in the character of international relations. If, instead of wasting lives and treasure by opposing each other as in the past, today's powers can pull in the same direction to solve problems common to all, we will begin to redeem history from much human folly. 
One of these common problems is, of course, terrorism, and American strategy endeavors to solve it by integrating it into the management of our key international relationships. We do not see the war against terrorism and the nurturing of constructive relationships among the major powers as mutually exclusive tasks. We conduct the war on terrorism with an eye toward great-power cooperation, and we seek enhanced great-power cooperation with an eye toward success in the war on terrorism. 
The logic of this dual approach rests on the fact that terrorism threatens the world order itself -- and thus creates a common interest among all powers that value peace, prosperity, and the rule of law. The civilized world has spent more than a thousand years trying to limit the destructiveness of war. Drawing a distinction between civilians and combatants has been an essential part of this process. But terrorism aims to erase that distinction. We cannot allow this to happen, not because we want to ""make the world safe"" again for major conventional war, but because we must reassure people everywhere that the world has not just traded one kind of danger for another with the end of the Cold War. The victory of freedom will turn hollow if new fears replace old ones. 
The common interest of all major powers in defeating terrorism is one source of a rare and remarkable opportunity: the United States' chance to enjoy excellent relations with all the world's major powers simultaneously. Of course, we have a head start in this, because we are blessed with many enduring friendships. None is more important than those enshrined in NATO. 
Some observers predicted that NATO would wither away after the Cold War, others that the United States and the European Union would even end up on a collision course. Neither prediction has, or will, come true. Not only has NATO survived, but both its membership and its mission have expanded. As for our relations with the EU, never has our common agenda been so large and mutually significant -- from advancing free trade to joint efforts in counterproliferation. 
It is true that we have had differences with some of our oldest and most valued NATO allies. But these are differences among friends. The transatlantic partnership is based so firmly on common interests and values that neither feuding personalities nor occasional divergent perceptions can derail it. We have new friends and old friends alike in Europe. They are all, in the end, best friends, which is why the president continues to talk about partnerships, not polarities, when he speaks about Europe. Some authorities say that we must move to a multipolar world. We do not agree -- not because we do not value competition and diversity, but because there need be no poles among a family of nations that shares basic values. We believe that it is wiser to work at overcoming differences than to polarize them further. 
Embracing Major Powers 
We work hard to have the best relations we can with nations large and small, old and new. But for practical purposes we concentrate on relations with major powers, especially those with whom we have had difficult relationships in the past, notably Russia, India, and China. 
Our relationship with Russia has been dramatically transformed since that November evening in 1989. Americans and Russians no longer point growing arsenals of missiles at each other. Thanks to the leadership of President Bush and President Vladimir Putin, we are now radically reducing our strategic weapons arsenals. Moscow is also a committed partner in fighting terrorism and in combating the global spread of wmd. 
U.S.-Russia commercial relations have also expanded and will expand further to mutual benefit -- not least, we trust, in the energy sector. The new relationship that is developing between Russia and NATO has real substance as well. From sharing intelligence on terrorism to working together to deal with humanitarian crises and peacekeeping, the NATO-Russia Council is operational. That relationship can expand as far as our creativity and mutual effort will let it. We are closer than ever to a Europe whole, free, and at peace. Such a Europe definitely includes Russia, as well as the other new and reborn republics that emerged from the Soviet Union. 
Perhaps most important, U.S. and Russian political and economic philosophies are converging. Today, Russia is more democratic than not. It is also more of a market economy than not. We should be patient as Russia develops its democratic institutions and as the remnants of Soviet-era corruption is rooted out and the rule of law firmly established. 
We do not agree on everything, of course. We had hoped for more Russian support for our Iraq policy, and we still hope Russia will change its attitude toward the Iranian nuclear program. We also differ over aspects of Russian policy in Chechnya. But the relationship as a whole is no longer locked in knee-jerk antagonism. We now have the necessary level of trust to resolve even the most difficult issues between us. 
Whereas Russia is still developing its democracy, India's democracy dates from its independence in 1947. With recent economic reforms setting institutional roots, India is developing into a mature market economy. As Indians themselves are the first to admit, however, their country still faces many challenges. Illiteracy, poverty, environmental degradation, and inadequate infrastructure all hamper progress. We want to help India overcome these challenges, and we want to help ourselves through a closer association with one of the world's venerable cultures. We have therefore worked to deepen our relationship with India. The two largest democracies on earth are no longer estranged. At the same time, we have also been able to advance our relations with Pakistan -- a country with domestic challenges of its own. 
India and Pakistan still dispute who should control Kashmir. During 2002, a major war between them -- perhaps involving nuclear weapons -- seemed distinctly possible. So, working with partners in Europe and Asia, we mobilized to help end the crisis. We have since been trying to turn our parallel improvement of relations with India and Pakistan into a triangle of conflict resolution. We do not impose ourselves as a mediator. But we do try to use the trust we have established with both sides to urge them toward conciliation by peaceful means. 
What the United States has done in South Asia is an example of ""turning adversity into opportunity,"" to quote President Bush. In a different way, we have done the same with China. 
Sino-American relations got off to a bad start in this administration when a certain American airplane made an unscheduled visit to Hainan Island in April 2001. Today, however, U.S. relations with China are the best they have been since President Richard Nixon first visited Beijing more than 30 years ago. This is not just because the September 11 attacks led us to shuffle priorities, nor only because we championed Chinese accession to the World Trade Organization; nor is it the result of the accession of a new generation of Chinese leaders. It is certainly not because we have ignored Chinese human rights abuses, China's still unacceptable weapons proliferation activities, or the reluctance of China's leadership to match political to economic reform. We have never downplayed these difficulties. 
The Sino-American relationship has nonetheless improved for a reason that transcends all these particulars: neither we nor the Chinese believe that there is anything inevitable about our relationship any longer -- either inevitably bad or inevitably good. Instead, we now believe that it is up to us, together, to take responsibility for our common future. The NSS put it directly: ""We welcome the emergence of a strong, peaceful, and prosperous China."" We also seek a constructive relationship. Indeed, we welcome a global role for China, so long as China assumes responsibilities commensurate with that role. China's leaders know all this. Neither false fear about the future nor the overhang of Cold War enmity prevents us from cooperating where our interests coincide. 
A case in point is North Korea. American and Chinese interests on the Korean Peninsula may not overlap completely, but they do so considerably. Neither side wishes to see nuclear weapons developed and deployed there. Neither side enjoys the spectacle of the dilapidated North Korean economy. Neither side wants the refugee crisis on China's border to worsen nor relishes a North Korean regime that smuggles drugs and weapons, counterfeits currencies, and engages in the periodic extortion of its neighbors through brinkmanship. And neither side, to be sure, has any interest in another Korean war. 
Thus we have worked to transform our common interests with China into solid and productive cooperation over the challenges posed by Pyongyang. We are also cooperating with Japan, Russia, and South Korea on the issue. Our agenda is ambitious, but it is succeeding, as attested to by the six-party framework for talks over North Korea's nuclear program. We employed this framework in September 2003, and we will do so again soon. Beijing, as well as Washington, deserves credit for this achievement. 
We still have a long way to go in dealing with North Korea's dangerous nuclear weapons program. As we have told the North Koreans, we have no intention of invading or attacking North Korea. During his trip to Asia in October 2003, President Bush suggested that he was even open to putting this intention in writing. We have stated our policy openly and honestly: we want peace, not war, and we want security, not fear, to envelop the Korean Peninsula and its neighbors. But we will not yield to threats and blackmail; if we did, we would only guarantee more threats and more attempts at blackmail. Nor will we take any options off the table. 
It is now well past time for North Korea to alter its behavior, cease its threats, and end its nuclear weapons program in a verifiable manner. That is what all of North Korea's neighbors desire, which is why, in the end, a diplomatic solution to the problem can be achieved. When this happens, we will have demonstrated that American diplomacy is designed to satisfy not only our own national interests, but also those of international security as a whole. We will show that the equities of other powers can be best advanced along with American ones, not in opposition to them. 
Interests and Responsibilities 
We must not take the present peace among the world's nations for granted. Today's peace will not just take care of itself. We have to work at it with patience, mindful that major war has broken out in the past despite a widespread conviction that it simply could not happen again. 
Of course, we want to promote human dignity and democracy in the world, to help people raise themselves from poverty, and to transform the inadequate system of global public health. We are pursuing these goals right now. But only if the deep peace of our era can be ""preserved, defended, and expanded"" -- to use the president's words -- can we pursue these goals for as long as it will take to achieve them. 
And make no mistake, these are the central goals of American policy in the twenty-first century. We fight terrorism because we must, but we seek a better world because we can -- because it is our desire, and our destiny, to do so. This is why we commit ourselves to democracy, development, global public health, and human rights, as well as to the prerequisite of a solid structure for global peace. These are not high-sounding decorations for our interests. They are our interests, the purposes our power serves. 
Because this is so, the United States' reputation for honesty and compassion will endure. Today, U.S. motives are impugned in some lands. But as we preserve, defend, and expand the peace that free peoples won in the twentieth century, we will see the United States vindicated in the eyes of the world in the twenty-first. 
It would be churlish to claim that the Bush administration's foreign policy has been error-free from the start. We are human beings; we all make mistakes. But we have always pursued the enlightened self-interest of the American people, and in our purposes and our principles there are no mistakes. 
Our enlightened self-interest puts us at odds with terrorists, tyrants, and others who wish us ill. From them we seek no advice or comity, and to them we will give no quarter. But our enlightened self-interest makes us partners with all those who cherish freedom, human dignity, and peace. We know the side on which the human spirit truly abides, and we take encouragement from this as our strategy unfolds. In the end, it is the only encouragement we really need.

It is also natural that the war on terrorism has become the United States' number one foreign policy priority. It will remain so for as long as necessary, because terrorism -- potentially linked to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) -- now represents the greatest threat to American lives. Defeating terrorism is a priority that drives not only military action to subdue individual terrorists and deter their state supporters but also multilateral cooperation in law enforcement and intelligence sharing. It encompasses efforts both to stigmatize terrorism as a political instrument and to reduce the underlying sources of terrorist motivation and recruitment.

But the breadth of U.S. strategy transcends the war on terrorism.

The sharp focus on the front lines of the war against terrorism, however, has made it harder than usual for people to grasp what American strategy is really all about. We all know the old aphorism that you can lead a horse to water but you can't make it drink. These days, it seems that an administration can develop a sound foreign policy strategy, but it can't get some people to acknowledge or understand it.

A succinct document of fewer than 40 pages, the NSS defines U.S. policy priorities in eight substantive sections.

Chairman Arafat has not been a genuine interlocutor for peace, but he has been an obstacle to it. Although our hopes for progress have been temporarily disappointed, it is now clear to all where the real problem lies. One way or another, we are bound eventually to get past this problem. Moreover, there is now a solid and growing constituency in Israel that supports prominent Palestinian leaders who genuinely seek an honorable and stable peace. Bleak as things often seem in this conflict, this does represent progress.

Conflicts in other regions have also demanded our attention -- and our compassion. The United States has not turned away from the suffering of the Liberian people, and we have been actively trying to end strife in Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Nor have we forgotten the need for continued progress in the Balkans, in Northern Ireland, and in East Timor. We are making progress in most if not all of these areas, and we are often doing so by supporting other governments that are taking the lead. In other words, we are working as a partner.



To say that the world has changed is a truism: the world, after all, is always changing. It is not so trivial, however, to specify just how it has changed. As I see it, the critical tipping point of recent years was the evening of November 9, 1989. That date is when the Berlin Wall was first breached, never to be repaired, marking the end of the Cold War and, before long, of the Soviet Union itself. These events, in turn, ended the epoch of intense struggle between liberty and totalitarianism that had shaped most of the twentieth century.

The president grasps the importance of these momentous events. As he wrote in the NSS, ""today, the international community has the best chance since the rise of the nation-state in the seventeenth century to build a world where great powers compete in peace instead of continually prepare for war. Today, the world's great powers find ourselves on the same side.""

This development is not just good news; it is revolutionary news. For too many years -- too many centuries -- the imperial habits of great powers squandered untold resources and talent by jousting for land, glory, and gold. The futility of such habits has become evident in the twenty-first century. The possession of vast territory, raw physical resources, and brute power guarantees neither prosperity nor peace. Investment in human capital, social trust, trade, and cooperation within and among nations does.

The sources of national strength and security for one nation thus need no longer threaten the security of others. An insight of the Enlightenment and a deep belief of the American founders -- that politics need not always be a zero-sum competition -- has at last been adopted by enough people worldwide to promise a qualitative difference in the character of international relations. If, instead of wasting lives and treasure by opposing each other as in the past, today's powers can pull in the same direction to solve problems common to all, we will begin to redeem history from much human folly.

One of these common problems is, of course, terrorism, and American strategy endeavors to solve it by integrating it into the management of our key international relationships. We do not see the war against terrorism and the nurturing of constructive relationships among the major powers as mutually exclusive tasks. We conduct the war on terrorism with an eye toward great-power cooperation, and we seek enhanced great-power cooperation with an eye toward success in the war on terrorism.

The logic of this dual approach rests on the fact that terrorism threatens the world order itself -- and thus creates a common interest among all powers that value peace, prosperity, and the rule of law. The civilized world has spent more than a thousand years trying to limit the destructiveness of war. Drawing a distinction between civilians and combatants has been an essential part of this process. But terrorism aims to erase that distinction. We cannot allow this to happen, not because we want to ""make the world safe"" again for major conventional war, but because we must reassure people everywhere that the world has not just traded one kind of danger for another with the end of the Cold War. The victory of freedom will turn hollow if new fears replace old ones.

The common interest of all major powers in defeating terrorism is one source of a rare and remarkable opportunity: the United States' chance to enjoy excellent relations with all the world's major powers simultaneously. Of course, we have a head start in this, because we are blessed with many enduring friendships. None is more important than those enshrined in NATO.

Some observers predicted that NATO would wither away after the Cold War, others that the United States and the European Union would even end up on a collision course. Neither prediction has, or will, come true. Not only has NATO survived, but both its membership and its mission have expanded. As for our relations with the EU, never has our common agenda been so large and mutually significant -- from advancing free trade to joint efforts in counterproliferation.

It is true that we have had differences with some of our oldest and most valued NATO allies. But these are differences among friends. The transatlantic partnership is based so firmly on common interests and values that neither feuding personalities nor occasional divergent perceptions can derail it. We have new friends and old friends alike in Europe. They are all, in the end, best friends, which is why the president continues to talk about partnerships, not polarities, when he speaks about Europe. Some authorities say that we must move to a multipolar world. We do not agree -- not because we do not value competition and diversity, but because there need be no poles among a family of nations that shares basic values. We believe that it is wiser to work at overcoming differences than to polarize them further.



Our relationship with Russia has been dramatically transformed since that November evening in 1989. Americans and Russians no longer point growing arsenals of missiles at each other. Thanks to the leadership of President Bush and President Vladimir Putin, we are now radically reducing our strategic weapons arsenals. Moscow is also a committed partner in fighting terrorism and in combating the global spread of wmd.

U.S.-Russia commercial relations have also expanded and will expand further to mutual benefit -- not least, we trust, in the energy sector. The new relationship that is developing between Russia and NATO has real substance as well. From sharing intelligence on terrorism to working together to deal with humanitarian crises and peacekeeping, the NATO-Russia Council is operational. That relationship can expand as far as our creativity and mutual effort will let it. We are closer than ever to a Europe whole, free, and at peace. Such a Europe definitely includes Russia, as well as the other new and reborn republics that emerged from the Soviet Union.

Perhaps most important, U.S. and Russian political and economic philosophies are converging. Today, Russia is more democratic than not. It is also more of a market economy than not. We should be patient as Russia develops its democratic institutions and as the remnants of Soviet-era corruption is rooted out and the rule of law firmly established.

We do not agree on everything, of course. We had hoped for more Russian support for our Iraq policy, and we still hope Russia will change its attitude toward the Iranian nuclear program. We also differ over aspects of Russian policy in Chechnya. But the relationship as a whole is no longer locked in knee-jerk antagonism. We now have the necessary level of trust to resolve even the most difficult issues between us.

Whereas Russia is still developing its democracy, India's democracy dates from its independence in 1947. With recent economic reforms setting institutional roots, India is developing into a mature market economy. As Indians themselves are the first to admit, however, their country still faces many challenges. Illiteracy, poverty, environmental degradation, and inadequate infrastructure all hamper progress. We want to help India overcome these challenges, and we want to help ourselves through a closer association with one of the world's venerable cultures. We have therefore worked to deepen our relationship with India. The two largest democracies on earth are no longer estranged. At the same time, we have also been able to advance our relations with Pakistan -- a country with domestic challenges of its own.

India and Pakistan still dispute who should control Kashmir. During 2002, a major war between them -- perhaps involving nuclear weapons -- seemed distinctly possible. So, working with partners in Europe and Asia, we mobilized to help end the crisis. We have since been trying to turn our parallel improvement of relations with India and Pakistan into a triangle of conflict resolution. We do not impose ourselves as a mediator. But we do try to use the trust we have established with both sides to urge them toward conciliation by peaceful means.

What the United States has done in South Asia is an example of ""turning adversity into opportunity,"" to quote President Bush. In a different way, we have done the same with China.

Sino-American relations got off to a bad start in this administration when a certain American airplane made an unscheduled visit to Hainan Island in April 2001. Today, however, U.S. relations with China are the best they have been since President Richard Nixon first visited Beijing more than 30 years ago. This is not just because the September 11 attacks led us to shuffle priorities, nor only because we championed Chinese accession to the World Trade Organization; nor is it the result of the accession of a new generation of Chinese leaders. It is certainly not because we have ignored Chinese human rights abuses, China's still unacceptable weapons proliferation activities, or the reluctance of China's leadership to match political to economic reform. We have never downplayed these difficulties.

The Sino-American relationship has nonetheless improved for a reason that transcends all these particulars: neither we nor the Chinese believe that there is anything inevitable about our relationship any longer -- either inevitably bad or inevitably good. Instead, we now believe that it is up to us, together, to take responsibility for our common future. The NSS put it directly: ""We welcome the emergence of a strong, peaceful, and prosperous China."" We also seek a constructive relationship. Indeed, we welcome a global role for China, so long as China assumes responsibilities commensurate with that role. China's leaders know all this. Neither false fear about the future nor the overhang of Cold War enmity prevents us from cooperating where our interests coincide.

A case in point is North Korea. American and Chinese interests on the Korean Peninsula may not overlap completely, but they do so considerably. Neither side wishes to see nuclear weapons developed and deployed there. Neither side enjoys the spectacle of the dilapidated North Korean economy. Neither side wants the refugee crisis on China's border to worsen nor relishes a North Korean regime that smuggles drugs and weapons, counterfeits currencies, and engages in the periodic extortion of its neighbors through brinkmanship. And neither side, to be sure, has any interest in another Korean war.

Thus we have worked to transform our common interests with China into solid and productive cooperation over the challenges posed by Pyongyang. We are also cooperating with Japan, Russia, and South Korea on the issue. Our agenda is ambitious, but it is succeeding, as attested to by the six-party framework for talks over North Korea's nuclear program. We employed this framework in September 2003, and we will do so again soon. Beijing, as well as Washington, deserves credit for this achievement.

We still have a long way to go in dealing with North Korea's dangerous nuclear weapons program. As we have told the North Koreans, we have no intention of invading or attacking North Korea. During his trip to Asia in October 2003, President Bush suggested that he was even open to putting this intention in writing. We have stated our policy openly and honestly: we want peace, not war, and we want security, not fear, to envelop the Korean Peninsula and its neighbors. But we will not yield to threats and blackmail; if we did, we would only guarantee more threats and more attempts at blackmail. Nor will we take any options off the table.

It is now well past time for North Korea to alter its behavior, cease its threats, and end its nuclear weapons program in a verifiable manner. That is what all of North Korea's neighbors desire, which is why, in the end, a diplomatic solution to the problem can be achieved. When this happens, we will have demonstrated that American diplomacy is designed to satisfy not only our own national interests, but also those of international security as a whole. We will show that the equities of other powers can be best advanced along with American ones, not in opposition to them.



Of course, we want to promote human dignity and democracy in the world, to help people raise themselves from poverty, and to transform the inadequate system of global public health. We are pursuing these goals right now. But only if the deep peace of our era can be ""preserved, defended, and expanded"" -- to use the president's words -- can we pursue these goals for as long as it will take to achieve them.

And make no mistake, these are the central goals of American policy in the twenty-first century. We fight terrorism because we must, but we seek a better world because we can -- because it is our desire, and our destiny, to do so. This is why we commit ourselves to democracy, development, global public health, and human rights, as well as to the prerequisite of a solid structure for global peace. These are not high-sounding decorations for our interests. They are our interests, the purposes our power serves.

Because this is so, the United States' reputation for honesty and compassion will endure. Today, U.S. motives are impugned in some lands. But as we preserve, defend, and expand the peace that free peoples won in the twentieth century, we will see the United States vindicated in the eyes of the world in the twenty-first.

It would be churlish to claim that the Bush administration's foreign policy has been error-free from the start. We are human beings; we all make mistakes. But we have always pursued the enlightened self-interest of the American people, and in our purposes and our principles there are no mistakes.

Our enlightened self-interest puts us at odds with terrorists, tyrants, and others who wish us ill. From them we seek no advice or comity, and to them we will give no quarter. But our enlightened self-interest makes us partners with all those who cherish freedom, human dignity, and peace. We know the side on which the human spirit truly abides, and we take encouragement from this as our strategy unfolds. In the end, it is the only encouragement we really need.

Colin Powell,20031203,Terrorist Designation Under Executive Order 13224,"Secretary of State Colin L. Powell on February 14 designated three Chechen organizations -- the Islamic International Brigade, the Special Purpose Islamic Regiment, and the Riyadus-Salikhin Reconnaissance and Sabotage Battalion of Chechen Martyrs -- as terrorist groups under the Executive Order on terrorist financing. 
The Islamic International Brigade, the Special Purpose Islamic Regiment, and the Riyadus-Salikhin Battalion are violent groups responsible for committing numerous acts of terrorism in Russia, including hostage-taking and assassination, that have threatened the safety of U.S. citizens and U.S. national security or foreign policy interests. All three groups were directly involved in the seizure of over 800 hostages at Moscow's Dubrovka Theater last October, an incident that resulted in the deaths of 129 hostages, including one U.S. citizen.
In making this designation, the United States calls on all Chechen leaders to renounce terrorist acts and cut any ties they may have to these terrorist groups and all who are affiliated with them. And we recognize that there are terrorist elements among those fighting Russian forces in Chechnya. At the same time, we do not consider all Chechen fighters to be terrorists. 
It remains our position that the broader conflict in Chechnya cannot be resolved militarily and requires a political solution. We have made this point repeatedly to the Russians. We urge Russia to pursue a political settlement and to establish meaningful accountability for human rights violations by its armed forces in Chechnya. We also condemn acts of terrorism and other abuses committed by armed Chechen groups.
The United States also underscores its strong support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia, a partner in the war on terrorism. We urge Russia to respect Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity while continuing to cooperate with Georgia and the United States on the issue of Chechen fighters and international terrorists in the Pankisi Gorge.
Executive Order 13224 blocks assets of these groups that are in the United States or held by U.S. persons, wherever located. Among other things, it further has the effect of prohibiting any U.S. persons from making or receiving any contribution of funds, goods, or services for the benefit of these groups. The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) today added the names of these three groups to its website as Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGTs). Section 1(b) of the Order, as amended, authorizes the Secretary of State to designate foreign entities and individuals that he determines -- in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of Homeland Security -- to have committed, or to pose a significant risk of committing, acts of terrorism that threaten the security of U.S. nationals or the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States.
Because these three groups are linked to Al-Qaida, the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom, China and Spain have requested today that the United Nations 1267 Sanctions Committee include the groups on its consolidated list pursuant to UN Security Council Resolutions 1267, 1390 and 1455. France has also indicated it will join the designation. This would be the first time that all five permanent members of the Security Council have joined in submitting names to the 1267 Committee. All UN Member States are obligated to impose arms and travel sanctions on, and to freeze without delay assets of, any individual or entity on the consolidated list, and to prohibit their nationals or persons in their territories from making available any funds or other resources to such entities.

Colin Powell,20030709,"Partnership, Under Construction","What a difference thirty years can make. It was in the winter of 1973 that I first visited the USSR. I entered the country at Khabarovsk, rode the Trans-Siberian railroad to Irkutsk, then flew to Moscow. I stood in Red Square, toured the GUM department store, and took in all I could about the country that I, as a member of the U.S. military establishment, had learned to both respect and fear. 
From that first trip I gathered three strong impressions of Russia. One was of its immensity and beauty. A second was of the common humanity between the Russian and American people that, I believed, would one day triumph over our political differences. My third impression was of the terrifying capacity of the Soviet ruling apparatus to intimidate its own people, to crush the human spirit.
Today, as I return again to Russia, I see that the country is still immense, and still very beautiful. I see that the common humanity of the Russian and the American people has triumphed over old differences. Most important, I see that Soviet terror is gone, enabling both sides to cut away at the thick crust of suspicion that characterized our Cold War relationship. 
Thirty years ago, Russian and American leaders sat in separate rooms, looked at maps, and saw target sets. Today, Russians and Americans often sit in the same room, look together at maps, and see targets of opportunity for cooperation on common problems. 
We do this in our joint efforts to fight terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and as we together fight HIV/AIDS and drug-resistant tuberculosis. We do this in Korea, where our cooperation includes that of China, Japan and South Korea. And we do this in the Russia-NATO Council, where the objects of our cooperation range from the Balkans and Afghanistan to anti-missile defense. 
The United States and Russia cooperate to mutual benefit, in part, because our interests coincide. We both recognize, for example, that terrorism threatens the essential moral order of international life as well as innocent human beings. We can cooperate on developing further Russias energy resources, matching products to markets and diversifying global energy resources, because both sides will prosper from it. 
But our ability to cooperate rests, too, on trust, which President Bush and President Putin have labored tirelessly to build. The knee-jerk antagonism of the past is behind us. We can now deal effectively with even the most difficult issues between us. We are friends now, and we can speak frankly to each other as only true friends can.It is natural that there will be occasions for such frank speaking. Although we share much in common, our histories, cultures, and geographies are different. So we do not agree on all policy questions; but then, no two major nations do.
We must acknowledge the sources of our differences if we are to deal wisely with one another. Beyond interests and trust among leaders, the capacity of any two nations to cooperate rests on a convergence of basic principles shared broadly in society. Here, too, thirty years has proved a long time. Our basic political and economic philosophies are closer today than ever. 
But as democracy is a work in progress even where it is most mature, so it is a work in progress in Russia. We know that the civic institutions of a democratic society take time to develop, that a nation cannot leap all at once out of its history anymore than a person can leap out of his skin. We know that the path to a democratic future is not a straight or an easy one. 
There can be no doubt, however, that Russias future greatness lies in its achieving stable democratic institutions. Political, economic and intellectual freedom form the gateway to prosperity, strength and social development in the 21st century. We welcome such a future for Russia. We do so as an expression of our common humanity, for the whole world will benefit from the flowering of Russias economy, sciences and arts. And we do so because we know that without basic principles shared in common, our relationship will not achieve its potential. This is why certain developments in Russian politics and foreign policy in recent months have given us pause. 
Russias democratic system seems not yet to have found the essential balance among the executive, legislative and judicial branches of government. Political power is not yet fully tethered to law. Key aspects of civil society  free media and political party development, for example  have not yet sustained an independent presence. Certain aspects of internal Russian policy in Chechnya, and toward neighbors that emerged from the former Soviet Union, have concerned us, too. We recognize Russias territorial integrity and its natural interest in lands that abut it. But we recognize no less the sovereign integrity of Russias neighbors and their rights to peaceful and respectful relations across their borders, as well.
Russia has too much to offer the world for us allow the promise of our partnership to go unfulfilled. As we joined thirty years ago to develop the Apollo-Soyuz mission, thirty years from now we can be surveying together the outer reaches of the solar system. Here on earth, our countries scientists can work together with the governments of Central Asia to restore the natural environment there, for example. We can work together to improve the global public health system to meet the challenges of our time. Our leaders can work together for peace, prosperity and freedom worldwide. 
Americas friendship with Russia, and with the Russian people, will not abate. Since our partnership ultimately does not depend on personalities, but on mutual interests and shared values, our hand will be outstretched, our hearts will remain open. As Russia constructs a new democratic political life, so we together will construct a greater U.S.-Russian partnership. 
We hope that Russias path to mature democracy and prosperity is cleared soon of all obstacles. We both have a large stake in that journey, and we trust in its eventual completion. It will take time. But after all, we know what a difference thirty years can make.

Colin Powell,20030709,"Secretary of State Colin L. Powell And The Honorable Alphonso Jackson, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and Head of U.S. Delegation to OSCE Conference on Racism, Xenophobia and Discrimination After Their Meeting","(1:50 p.m. EDT) 
SECRETARY POWELL: Well, good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. As President Bush has said, the United States of America stands for the non-negotiable demands of human dignity. That is why we place such a high importance on the conference and the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe, a conference that will be held on tolerance and the fight against racism, xenophobia and discrimination which the Belgian Government will graciously host in Brussels on September 13th and 14th. You may recall that we also sent a strong delegation to last year's conference under the leadership of former Congressman J.C. Watts. 
We do this because we applaud the OSCE's pioneering work in fighting intolerance, reflected earlier this year in the Berlin Conference on Anti-Semitism which I had the privilege to attend and represent the United States at. 
The upcoming conference in Brussels is an important opportunity to further raise public awareness of the rise in hate crimes and other acts of intolerance that have occurred in Europe and North America this year. The United States is honored that my friend and cabinet colleague, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Alphonso Jackson, will lead a distinguished delegation to the conference. Secretary Jackson has a long history of activism in key areas of civil rights, education and community development. 
Secretary Jackson will be joined by Mr. Robert Woodson, Sr., who is also present with us today, of the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, and Ms. Tamar Jacoby of The Manhattan Institute, who is also with us today, who has championed the plight of migrant workers and has a long and well known career in this field. And I'm pleased to have all three of them with me today. 
I also wish to thank the other members of the delegation who are not here, but who will also be attending: former Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson, William Cardinal Keeler of Baltimore, and Dr. Maha Hussein, and Iraqi-American who will also be part of the delegation. 
The choice of such an expert, high-level delegation testifies to the seriousness with which the American people take the fight against racism and discrimination within our society and worldwide. U.S. leadership at the conference will be key to reaching agreement on recommendations to promote tolerance and respect for diversity. And President Bush and I have every confidence that Secretary Jackson and his outstanding delegation will make lasting contributions to the success of the conference and to the cause of human dignity and equality. 
And now I would invite Secretary Jackson to say a word or two. 
SECRETARY JACKSON: Thank you very much, Secretary Powell. I am honored that President Bush has asked me to lead the U.S. delegation to Brussels. 
Following the conference, we anticipate that the countries of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe will negotiate a new and specific commitment by their government to combat discrimination and promote tolerance. 
It is critical that the governments enforce anti-discrimination laws, train their law enforcement authorities, gather statistics on hate crimes; more importantly, they need to speak out publicly and forcefully when hate crimes occur in their respective countries. 
The conference comes as a direct response to the increase we've seen around the world during the past decade to intolerance and hate crimes. The 55 nations from Europe, Eurasia, North America will come together in Brussels determined to address the increase in hate crimes. We will share ideas of how to combat these crimes. 
As you know, the United States has struggled with its own history of prejudice and intolerance. But we've taken many steps to address those past and failing issues. I look forward to sharing the American experience with my colleagues abroad and learn all that we can from their experience as well as they can learn from ours. 
Thank you so much. 
SECRETARY POWELL: We have time for one or two questions if there are any. 
QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, 
SECRETARY POWELL: Yeah. 
QUESTION: What is your -- we've just heard in the past decade there's been an increase. Do you have a feel for whether racism is on the increase or -- in your last -- in your four years here, what you have seen? I mean around the world, of course. 
SECRETARY POWELL: Yeah. It's hard to measure it that way to say it's increased and decreased. I think what I have seen is that in specific areas there have been increases that should be of concern to us, anti-Semitism in some parts of Europe and anti-Muslim attitudes in some parts of the world. But whether I can tell you, as a worldwide phenomenon, it's gone up or down, I don't know. 
I think there has been increasing signs of tolerance in other parts of the world, where people recognize that diversity should be a source of strength, not a source of weakness. 
QUESTION: Mr. Secretary -- 
SECRETARY POWELL: Somebody I haven't seen in quite a while, Andrea. 
QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, I'd like to get your response, sir, to some comments that were made by the Russian President, Vladimir Putin, responding to the recent actions, the recent terrorist acts in Russia and in the Caucasus. He said that the U.S. policy, the U.S. continuing to push for a political solution in Chechnya, is a double standard. Why, in your estimation, is it not a double standard? 
SECRETARY POWELL: I think that all parties, to include the Russian Federation, have been looking for a political solution to the crisis in Chechnya. I think President Putin is making reference to occasional visits, not one recently, but some time ago, of Chechen personalities to staff members in the State Department as part of our way of keeping informed about the situation in the region. 
Where we are now absolutely united, though, is in condemning this horrible, horrible action that took place in this small town. I went over to the Russian Embassy earlier today to express our deepest condolences. I did it on behalf of President and Mrs. Bush and the American people and to let the people of Russia, the people of Beslan, know that we stand with them. Terrorism of this kind has no place in the world. To take children and to put children at risk and to murder them in this deliberate manner has to be condemned. 
The civilized world condemns it and all other forms of terrorism, and we will work closely with the Russian authorities in any way that we can to deal with this matter. We have provided, as you know, some medical assistance and some other supplies that they needed and we look forward to the results of their investigation to see what it tells us about the perpetrators. 
QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, foreign ministers of India and Pakistan met in Delhi this week, or yesterday, but the problem between the two countries that India is saying that Kashmir should not be the core issue, but Pakistan is saying that Kashmir is the core issue. 
Do you see a solution, sir, for Kashmir? And also, what part are you taking now because it has been going on for 55 years now. How long the childrens of both countries will be suffering and so many people have been killed and will continue killed? 
SECRETARY POWELL: I spoke to both ministers late last week before they had their meeting and I was pleased to learn from both of them that they are entering into this dialogue in a positive way. Both ministers recognize that Kashmir is an issue among many issues that have to be dealt with between the two nations. 
I am pleased that they are actually talking to one another at this level and at any many other levels and that the environment for positive discussions has improved so greatly over the last year and a half, two years. You'll recall less than about two years ago we were concerned about a major conflict between the two nations and now they are in discussions with one another. 
Kashmir is a very difficult issue. It will take time to resolve. Both parties know that it has to be dealt with and it is part of their agenda. 
QUESTION: But, sir, people in both countries, 1.3 billion people -- 
SECRETARY POWELL: Thank you. 
QUESTION: -- people are saying that Kashmir should not be the core issue because there are other issues. 
SECRETARY POWELL: Both parties, as I've said, realize it's an issue on the agenda. They have both acknowledged it. And this is the first meeting between these two ministers, ministers of the two countries in a fairly long period of time. So let's take heart in the reality that they are discussing all issues between the two countries, of which Kashmir is one, and both have acknowledged that. 
QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, on Iran, last week you said that now was the time to take this matter to the UN Security Council. What's your judgment now? Do you have sufficient support for that on the IAEA Board of Governors? And secondly, are you at all inclined toward a reported deal with Iran under which would cease a lot of centrifuge activity that it has already promised a number of times to stop and has then said it will pursue? 
SECRETARY POWELL: As you recall, we thought it should have been referred to the Security Council last November. But other colleagues of mine, particularly, the European Union-3, wanted to engage Iran and find a solution. They have been working on that for the last -- almost a year, and unfortunately, I don't think the response from Iran has been very positive or constructive, either to what the EU-3 commitments were or to the IAEA. 
We believe that we have seen enough that action is warranted, and the IAEA should refer the matter to the Security Council at its upcoming meeting next week. We'll have to see what the overall judgment is among the IAEA members, 35 members on the Board, and I won't prejudge what they will do. But there is another meeting in November, but we believe time is -- time is passing and this is a matter that should go to the Security Council as quickly as possible. 
With respect to reports that Iran is prepared to do something in response to some offer or some kind of bargain, I've seen those reports, but I'd be more interested in seeing Iranian action to stop the steps that they say they are now embarking upon with respect to the production of materials that, in our judgment, leads to a nuclear weapons -- gives evidence of a nuclear weapons program, which one must assume could lead to the development, production of a nuclear weapon, which I think would be very destabilizing. 
QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, how close are you to making a determination on genocide in Sudan, and are you at all encouraged by your conversations with UN Security Council members about a strong resolution on the Government of Sudan? 
SECRETARY POWELL: I think that we need to take a look at what has happened in the region over the last month since the UN resolution was passed. We've seen improvement with respect to humanitarian access, and we need more and more humanitarian organizations to get involved. We need those who have made financial commitments to meet those commitments and put the cash into the system. 
The security situation isn't as improved as we would like it to be, and we hope that the Security Council will be looking at this very, very closely to see what additional action or additional resolutions might be appropriate, and we're looking at language. I'm in touch with all of my principal colleagues in the Security Council on this matter. 
With respect to the issue of what to call it -- genocide or not -- let me begin by saying that genocide, if it is so declared, or an international organization so declares it, does not open any new doors that are not available to us now. So we are deeply engaged in this with both our political and diplomatic efforts with the money we're putting to it. 
The team that we sent over to interview people who have been forced out of their homes has returned. I do have their report, and I'll be studying it in considerable depth over the next day or so, and I'll be testifying on the subject on Thursday before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 
One more. 
QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Israeli helicopters and war planes -- 
SECRETARY POWELL: Don't assume there is something to announce. (Laughter.) What I said was I will make judgments over the next day or two and you will get the results of my judgment when I appear before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. I didn't want to have you go down the wrong road. (Laughter.) 
Yes. 
QUESTION: Thank you. Israeli helicopters and war planes hit a training camp, Hamas training camp in Gaza, killing 14, and now Hamas is promising to retaliate; and also Israel is extending the security wall 30 more kilometers after the Beersheba incident or attack. Do you think this is -- these kinds of actions are helpful, retaliation and hitting? 
SECRETARY POWELL: No, I don't think they're helpful and I don't think the -- the situation is very tragic. There is a way to get out of this. It's called the roadmap. Both sides have obligations that they have to meet under the roadmap. We've got to get it started. We believe that Prime Minister Sharon's plan to begin with the removal of the Gaza settlements and some of the West Bank settlements give us an opportunity. 
We have asked the Palestinian Authority to empower the Prime Minister so that the Prime Minister has control of all of the security organizations of the Palestinian Authority and can use that power and those organizations to crack down on terrorism. Unfortunately, we have not seen that. 
And we are also, of course, in touch with the Israelis with respect to their obligations under the roadmap as well. But until we get this roadmap process going, these kinds of things happen and they're tragic whenever they do happen, and retaliation is not a solution to the problems that we face in the region. 
Thank you.

SECRETARY POWELL: Well, good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. As President Bush has said, the United States of America stands for the non-negotiable demands of human dignity. That is why we place such a high importance on the conference and the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe, a conference that will be held on tolerance and the fight against racism, xenophobia and discrimination which the Belgian Government will graciously host in Brussels on September 13th and 14th. You may recall that we also sent a strong delegation to last year's conference under the leadership of former Congressman J.C. Watts.

We do this because we applaud the OSCE's pioneering work in fighting intolerance, reflected earlier this year in the Berlin Conference on Anti-Semitism which I had the privilege to attend and represent the United States at.

The upcoming conference in Brussels is an important opportunity to further raise public awareness of the rise in hate crimes and other acts of intolerance that have occurred in Europe and North America this year. The United States is honored that my friend and cabinet colleague, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Alphonso Jackson, will lead a distinguished delegation to the conference. Secretary Jackson has a long history of activism in key areas of civil rights, education and community development.

Secretary Jackson will be joined by Mr. Robert Woodson, Sr., who is also present with us today, of the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, and Ms. Tamar Jacoby of The Manhattan Institute, who is also with us today, who has championed the plight of migrant workers and has a long and well known career in this field. And I'm pleased to have all three of them with me today.

I also wish to thank the other members of the delegation who are not here, but who will also be attending: former Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson, William Cardinal Keeler of Baltimore, and Dr. Maha Hussein, and Iraqi-American who will also be part of the delegation.

The choice of such an expert, high-level delegation testifies to the seriousness with which the American people take the fight against racism and discrimination within our society and worldwide. U.S. leadership at the conference will be key to reaching agreement on recommendations to promote tolerance and respect for diversity. And President Bush and I have every confidence that Secretary Jackson and his outstanding delegation will make lasting contributions to the success of the conference and to the cause of human dignity and equality.

And now I would invite Secretary Jackson to say a word or two.

SECRETARY JACKSON: Thank you very much, Secretary Powell. I am honored that President Bush has asked me to lead the U.S. delegation to Brussels.

Following the conference, we anticipate that the countries of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe will negotiate a new and specific commitment by their government to combat discrimination and promote tolerance.

It is critical that the governments enforce anti-discrimination laws, train their law enforcement authorities, gather statistics on hate crimes; more importantly, they need to speak out publicly and forcefully when hate crimes occur in their respective countries.

The conference comes as a direct response to the increase we've seen around the world during the past decade to intolerance and hate crimes. The 55 nations from Europe, Eurasia, North America will come together in Brussels determined to address the increase in hate crimes. We will share ideas of how to combat these crimes.

As you know, the United States has struggled with its own history of prejudice and intolerance. But we've taken many steps to address those past and failing issues. I look forward to sharing the American experience with my colleagues abroad and learn all that we can from their experience as well as they can learn from ours.

Colin Powell,20020822,Remarks with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov (1350 hrs),"[audio] 

SECRETARY POWELL: Well, good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. It was again a great pleasure for me to receive my colleague, Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, here at the State Department. This is our eighth meeting. We have met in Cairo, in Rome, Budapest, Brussels, Hanoi, Washington twice, and I have promised him that our next meeting will be in Moscow, unless we happen to meet in Crawford, Texas, or somewhere -- or in Shanghai. 
So it's part of a long series of discussions and constant phone calls that have allowed us to develop a solid relationship, not only between our two ministries, but between our two countries. And today was no exception. We spoke about terrorism at considerable length. I was very pleased to receive from the Minister expressions of condolence for those who lost their lives at the World Trade Center and at the Pentagon last week. 
Deputy Secretary Armitage called me from Moscow this morning to also tell me what it was like in Moscow to have Russian citizens coming by our embassy to place flowers and candles and otherwise remember those who lost their lives. 
We had a good discussion of potential areas of cooperation as we go after this worldwide threat to civilization, and a comprehensive campaign where all elements of national and international power must be used: law enforcement, military activity, legal actions, financial actions, anything that can be used to get at these terrorist organizations. In the first instance, al-Qaida and Mr. Usama bin Laden, but ultimately terrorism wherever it rears its ugly head. 
We also had a full discussion of regional issues, Iran, Iraq, Macedonia and other areas of interest to us, and we had a good discussion as well of the conversations we have been having between our two sides on a new strategic framework. And I think we are moving in the right direction. We have not solved the problem yet of how we can find a new strategic framework to go forward. But I think in our conversations today and the conversations that Under Secretary Bolton and Assistant Secretary Fife of the Pentagon have had with Russian military officials and Defense Ministry officials and Foreign Affairs Ministry officials, we can begin to see a way ahead that will increase stability and lead us in the direction of a new strategic framework. 
So, once again, Igor, a great pleasure to receive you, sir. 
FOREIGN MINISTER IVANOV: (As translated.) First of all, on behalf of the President of Russia and on behalf of the entire Russian people, I would like to once again express sincere condolences to the people of the United States over the tragedy which occurred on the 11th of September in the United States. There is no doubt that this crime, unprecedented in its scale, goes far beyond the borders of the United States. 
The international terrorism has caused a blatant challenge to all civilized humanity, to all civilized world. This reaffirms once again the urgent necessity to join efforts of the entire international community in the fight against new challenges and threats, including in the first place the threat of international terrorism. 
Russia and the United States have agreed to closely coordinate their actions in these areas. We will be coordinating our efforts within the framework of appropriate agencies as well as within the framework of appropriate working groups that have already been established and that have already been working between the United States and Russia. 
At the same time, we believe that it's high time that we established by joint efforts a global system to counteract global threats and challenges. And we believe that the work on establishing such global system must begin as early as today. 
We also place the main focus of our negotiations today on the preparations for the forthcoming summit meetings between the Presidents of Russia and the United States in Shanghai during the summit of APEC as well as the preparations of the first official visit of Russian President Putin to the United States. 
We are satisfied with the fact that the relations between Russia and the United States are gaining positive dynamics. This has become possible, first of all, thanks to the summit meetings that our Presidents, the Presidents of Russia and the United States, conducted in Ljubljana and Genoa. And we are convinced that the forthcoming meetings between our Presidents will give a further impetus, a further impulse to our relations. 
As the Secretary of State of the United States has just pointed out, we are conducting intensive consultations on the entire scope of issues relating to strategic security. On some of the issues, our positions are becoming closer. On the other issues, we are continuing active consultations. We have agreed to continue these consultations to be able to report the first results during the forthcoming summits of our Presidents. 
We have also discussed regional conflicts. First of all, we expressed some optimism in connection with a decrease of tensions, with some decrease of tension in the Middle East. Both Russia and the United States are in favor of beginning direct dialogue between Peres and Arafat to begin practical implementation of the Mitchell Plan. 
We have discussed also a number of other issues on which we are closely cooperating. I would like to specifically underscore that the negotiations were conducted in an open and constructive atmosphere. And I would like to thank personally for this, Mr. Secretary of State. 
SECRETARY POWELL: Thank you very much. I just might add that earlier today, I spoke to both Chairman Arafat and to Prime Minister Sharon and expressed my satisfaction that the first 24 hours of the arrangement they made yesterday has resulted in a significant decrease in the amount of violence in the region. I encouraged both sides to keep moving in this direction. 
The Prime Minister advised me that he had talked to Mr. Peres earlier with the same message. Prime Minister Sharon noted that, for the first time in many, many months, he has seen quiet since midnight of last night. And let us all hope that we can keep this process now moving forward and it will result in an early meeting between Foreign Minister Peres and Chairman Arafat. 
We have time for just a couple of questions. 
QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, can I ask you -- can I ask both of you -- there is obviously concern, as well as support, among your allies about the scale of any future American military action. Can you offer any reassurance to your allies about what you are planning? 
And Foreign Minister Ivanov, have you had any words of caution to add? 
SECRETARY POWELL: We are approaching this not as a single battle to be fought by the military but as a campaign that will involve all of our elements of national power. And we will be discussing with our friends and allies in the days ahead exactly how we think this campaign should unfold. 
With respect to the military component of such a campaign, I would not of course get into any of the details. But we know that there are some of our friends who are in a position to participate in such operations, and others who really will just provide us other kinds of support, whether it's diplomatic support, political support or working with the international police and intelligence activities. So at this time, I am not prepared to describe what the nature of any of our military planning might be. 
FOREIGN MINISTER IVANOV: (As translated.) As Mr. Secretary of State has already said, we have not discussed concrete issues related to possible reaction of the United States to these events. At the same time, we share common position that we need to strengthen international cooperation in combating international terrorism. All means must be used in the fight against terrorism, beginning from political and legal means and including, when and if necessary, use of force. 
We maintain constant contacts through our specialized services and between our foreign ministries. We have ongoing information exchanges, and we will continue to maintain our constant, close contact on all these issues. 
QUESTION: You mentioned that the United States is willing to fight international terrorism anywhere. Does that include Chechnya? Because Russia faced international terrorism much earlier than September the 11th. 
And a question to the Foreign Minister. (In Russian.) 
SECRETARY POWELL: We have discussed this on many occasions. Russia is facing a difficult challenge in Chechnya and we know it's a challenge they must respond to, and we will do what we can to help. But, at the same time, we have always encouraged our Russian colleagues to work hard to find a political solution to this tragic conflict, and also to defend their interests in a way that are consistent with human rights and other standards. But we recognize the serious challenge faced by Russia in Chechnya. 
FOREIGN MINISTER IVANOV: (As translated.) I have said that, in combating international terrorism, no means can be excluded, including the use of force. At the same time, so far, we have not discussed with the United States any specific, any concrete actions. 
QUESTION: Will you be requiring a UN resolution before joining in any military action? 
SECRETARY POWELL: There is a UN resolution that was passed last week. And as we go forward in the development of this campaign, if we see a need for additional UN resolutions to authorize certain actions, not necessarily military actions but other actions such as with respect to fighting international terrorism or going after financial support of international terrorism, we would certainly bring such proposals to the United Nations. 
FOREIGN MINISTER IVANOV: (As translated.) You know, the United Nations has already passed a large number of documents related to combating international terrorism. If I'm not mistaken, there are as many documents as 12 on this issue. We believe that the United Nations shall continue to play a leading role in joining in concerting the efforts, in combining the efforts of the international community in the fight against international terrorism. 
SECRETARY POWELL: We have time for just one more before the Minister has to go see the President. 
QUESTION: Is the United States going to send troops to Afghanistan? 
SECRETARY POWELL: When we have decided what our entire campaign plan is, to include any military actions we might take, the world will know about it. But I am not prepared to discuss any potential military operations at this time. 
Thank you very much. 
QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, time for one more? 
SECRETARY POWELL: I have to get to the White House. 
QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, did the Russians make any linkages whatsoever, whether it be with Chechnya, national missile defense, with NATO expansion? Were there any requests on their side? 
SECRETARY POWELL: We talked about all of these items, as we always do, missile defense, ABM, Chechnya. But they presented no linkages between that and the current incident. The current tragedy that we are dealing with, they were very forthcoming, they want to be helpful, and they didn't put any specific requests or bills or links on the table. 
Thank you.

This is our eighth meeting. We have met in Cairo, in Rome, Budapest, Brussels, Hanoi, Washington twice, and I have promised him that our next meeting will be in Moscow, unless we happen to meet in Crawford, Texas, or somewhere -- or in Shanghai.

We had a good discussion of potential areas of cooperation as we go after this worldwide threat to civilization, and a comprehensive campaign where all elements of national and international power must be used: law enforcement, military activity, legal actions, financial actions, anything that can be used to get at these terrorist organizations. In the first instance, al-Qaida and Mr. Usama bin Laden, but ultimately terrorism wherever it rears its ugly head.

We also had a full discussion of regional issues, Iran, Iraq, Macedonia and other areas of interest to us, and we had a good discussion as well of the conversations we have been having between our two sides on a new strategic framework. And I think we are moving in the right direction. We have not solved the problem yet of how we can find a new strategic framework to go forward. But I think in our conversations today and the conversations that Under Secretary Bolton and Assistant Secretary Fife of the Pentagon have had with Russian military officials and Defense Ministry officials and Foreign Affairs Ministry officials, we can begin to see a way ahead that will increase stability and lead us in the direction of a new strategic framework.

So, once again, Igor, a great pleasure to receive you, sir.

FOREIGN MINISTER IVANOV: (As translated.) First of all, on behalf of the President of Russia and on behalf of the entire Russian people, I would like to once again express sincere condolences to the people of the United States over the tragedy which occurred on the 11th of September in the United States. There is no doubt that this crime, unprecedented in its scale, goes far beyond the borders of the United States.

The international terrorism has caused a blatant challenge to all civilized humanity, to all civilized world. This reaffirms once again the urgent necessity to join efforts of the entire international community in the fight against new challenges and threats, including in the first place the threat of international terrorism.

Russia and the United States have agreed to closely coordinate their actions in these areas. We will be coordinating our efforts within the framework of appropriate agencies as well as within the framework of appropriate working groups that have already been established and that have already been working between the United States and Russia.

At the same time, we believe that it's high time that we established by joint efforts a global system to counteract global threats and challenges. And we believe that the work on establishing such global system must begin as early as today.

We also place the main focus of our negotiations today on the preparations for the forthcoming summit meetings between the Presidents of Russia and the United States in Shanghai during the summit of APEC as well as the preparations of the first official visit of Russian President Putin to the United States.

We are satisfied with the fact that the relations between Russia and the United States are gaining positive dynamics. This has become possible, first of all, thanks to the summit meetings that our Presidents, the Presidents of Russia and the United States, conducted in Ljubljana and Genoa. And we are convinced that the forthcoming meetings between our Presidents will give a further impetus, a further impulse to our relations.

As the Secretary of State of the United States has just pointed out, we are conducting intensive consultations on the entire scope of issues relating to strategic security. On some of the issues, our positions are becoming closer. On the other issues, we are continuing active consultations. We have agreed to continue these consultations to be able to report the first results during the forthcoming summits of our Presidents.

We have also discussed regional conflicts. First of all, we expressed some optimism in connection with a decrease of tensions, with some decrease of tension in the Middle East. Both Russia and the United States are in favor of beginning direct dialogue between Peres and Arafat to begin practical implementation of the Mitchell Plan.

We have discussed also a number of other issues on which we are closely cooperating. I would like to specifically underscore that the negotiations were conducted in an open and constructive atmosphere. And I would like to thank personally for this, Mr. Secretary of State.

SECRETARY POWELL: Thank you very much. I just might add that earlier today, I spoke to both Chairman Arafat and to Prime Minister Sharon and expressed my satisfaction that the first 24 hours of the arrangement they made yesterday has resulted in a significant decrease in the amount of violence in the region. I encouraged both sides to keep moving in this direction.

The Prime Minister advised me that he had talked to Mr. Peres earlier with the same message. Prime Minister Sharon noted that, for the first time in many, many months, he has seen quiet since midnight of last night. And let us all hope that we can keep this process now moving forward and it will result in an early meeting between Foreign Minister Peres and Chairman Arafat.

We have time for just a couple of questions.

QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, can I ask you -- can I ask both of you -- there is obviously concern, as well as support, among your allies about the scale of any future American military action. Can you offer any reassurance to your allies about what you are planning?

And Foreign Minister Ivanov, have you had any words of caution to add?

SECRETARY POWELL: We are approaching this not as a single battle to be fought by the military but as a campaign that will involve all of our elements of national power. And we will be discussing with our friends and allies in the days ahead exactly how we think this campaign should unfold.

With respect to the military component of such a campaign, I would not of course get into any of the details. But we know that there are some of our friends who are in a position to participate in such operations, and others who really will just provide us other kinds of support, whether it's diplomatic support, political support or working with the international police and intelligence activities. So at this time, I am not prepared to describe what the nature of any of our military planning might be.

FOREIGN MINISTER IVANOV: (As translated.) As Mr. Secretary of State has already said, we have not discussed concrete issues related to possible reaction of the United States to these events. At the same time, we share common position that we need to strengthen international cooperation in combating international terrorism. All means must be used in the fight against terrorism, beginning from political and legal means and including, when and if necessary, use of force.

We maintain constant contacts through our specialized services and between our foreign ministries. We have ongoing information exchanges, and we will continue to maintain our constant, close contact on all these issues.

QUESTION: You mentioned that the United States is willing to fight international terrorism anywhere. Does that include Chechnya? Because Russia faced international terrorism much earlier than September the 11th.

And a question to the Foreign Minister. (In Russian.)

SECRETARY POWELL: We have discussed this on many occasions. Russia is facing a difficult challenge in Chechnya and we know it's a challenge they must respond to, and we will do what we can to help. But, at the same time, we have always encouraged our Russian colleagues to work hard to find a political solution to this tragic conflict, and also to defend their interests in a way that are consistent with human rights and other standards. But we recognize the serious challenge faced by Russia in Chechnya.

FOREIGN MINISTER IVANOV: (As translated.) I have said that, in combating international terrorism, no means can be excluded, including the use of force. At the same time, so far, we have not discussed with the United States any specific, any concrete actions.

QUESTION: Will you be requiring a UN resolution before joining in any military action?

SECRETARY POWELL: There is a UN resolution that was passed last week. And as we go forward in the development of this campaign, if we see a need for additional UN resolutions to authorize certain actions, not necessarily military actions but other actions such as with respect to fighting international terrorism or going after financial support of international terrorism, we would certainly bring such proposals to the United Nations.

FOREIGN MINISTER IVANOV: (As translated.) You know, the United Nations has already passed a large number of documents related to combating international terrorism. If I'm not mistaken, there are as many documents as 12 on this issue. We believe that the United Nations shall continue to play a leading role in joining in concerting the efforts, in combining the efforts of the international community in the fight against international terrorism.

SECRETARY POWELL: We have time for just one more before the Minister has to go see the President.

QUESTION: Is the United States going to send troops to Afghanistan?

SECRETARY POWELL: When we have decided what our entire campaign plan is, to include any military actions we might take, the world will know about it. But I am not prepared to discuss any potential military operations at this time.

Thank you very much.

QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, time for one more?

SECRETARY POWELL: I have to get to the White House.

QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, did the Russians make any linkages whatsoever, whether it be with Chechnya, national missile defense, with NATO expansion? Were there any requests on their side?

SECRETARY POWELL: We talked about all of these items, as we always do, missile defense, ABM, Chechnya. But they presented no linkages between that and the current incident. The current tragedy that we are dealing with, they were very forthcoming, they want to be helpful, and they didn't put any specific requests or bills or links on the table.

Thank you.

Colin Powell,20030821,Remarks at The Elliott School of International Affairs,"[DSL/Cable] [dial-up] [audio]

[DSL/Cable]

Thank you all very much, and thank you for that wonderful GW welcome. It's great to be back on campus on this very, very special occasion. And, Emily, I thank you for that most touching and gracious introduction. Madame Marshal, Chairman Harding, the distinguished gynecologist Dr. Trachtenberg -- (laughter and applause) -- President Elliott, members of the faculty, other members of the GW family who are here, Mrs. Trachtenberg, Mrs. Elliott, it really is a great delight to be with you and a great delight especially to be with the young people, the students who are here to learn, here to prepare themselves for positions of leadership in this great country of ours.

I can't tell you what a privilege it was for me a few moments ago to dedicate a new building to serve the Elliott School of International Affairs of the wonderful George Washington University.

Public buildings such as the new building are not just simply concrete and glass, not just building materials. An architect gives a building its design, and those who first labor in it raise up its spirit. That design and that spirit together give character to the life of the building, and the building in turn influences those who inhabit its halls, its rooms.



We have just come from 1957 E Street, where the new building stands. I pray that those who will pass though its portals over the many years to come will be shaped by wisdom and by a dedication to serve society. We are now assembled here at Lisner Auditorium, and that's fine, and really it's quite appropriate because our business today transcends more than just a single new building. As Dean Harding noted, this month we also celebrate the Elliott School's 15th anniversary, and the 105th anniversary of GW's International Affairs program. And so my congratulations to the entire George Washington University family on these outstanding achievements.

And I am so proud to be a member of that GW family. I am at home here. I received, as you heard, an honorary doctorate in February of 1990, when I was Dr. Trachtenberg's first commencement speaker. It's hard to believe, Steve, that 13 years have passed between that occasion and this. But I do believe that you have used those years well. It shows in many achievements, large and small, the construction that we see all over this part of town, the improvements that have been made in the curriculum, the thriving nature of the academic community that you have built here.

And so, Steve, I want to take this opportunity to thank you and Mrs. Trachtenberg for the dedication that you have given to this school, to your community, and to this wonderful city of ours. Thank you, Steve. (Applause.)



The honorary doctorate was easy. The MBA was a little more difficult. (Laughter.) And as you heard mentioned earlier, I received my letter of acceptance on June 15th, 1969, while I was in Vietnam.



Earlier that day I had been out at a landing zone -- not far from a place called Duc Pho, watching a rifle company return from patrol in the Vietnamese jungle. I was already in some ways in a kind of graduate school, the graduate school of war, a school, a place, where people were shooting at you.

On that day, I only had three weeks left to my second Vietnam tour and, of course, I was anxious to return home, return to my family. And thanks to that letter from GW, I now knew where I was headed. I was happy for that, but the first semester here was not easy-going for me. I was the oldest student in our program, seeking an MBA in data processing, a subject I knew nothing about. The Army said we had to learn about these newfangled things called computers -- and, Powell, you're going to learn about it, and if we throw you out later you will have a second skill that you can take into civilian life. (Laughter.) But I lacked much of the background one needed for such a program. I didn't have the economics or the math, the statistics. I was bewildered, and worried that the university had somehow made a mistake in admitting me. And after they took a look at my undergraduate record from the City College of New York, they were also contemplating whether they had made a mistake in admitting me. (Laughter.)



To make matters worse, I was a career Army guy now in civilian drag on campus at the height of the Vietnam war movement.

But things turned around, as they usually did. I had a great two years here. It was an important period in my life. My third child was born while I was a student here. I saw turmoil in my country. I watched riots in the city. I saw tear gas float across this campus. I've often told people that those early years of the '70s were perhaps the darkest periods in my life with respect to how my country was doing and going. But things turned around for me in a personal way at GW, and a few years later, with changes in government and with President Ford coming in, we got through that terrible period. It proves again that bleak evenings almost always, in our wonderful land with our wonderful system, bleak evenings can always give way to bright mornings. So I worked hard here, kept faith, left with a pretty good record, and was even encouraged to pursue a doctoral degree, and perhaps join the faculty. But I decided I better go back to that which I really knew something about, and that was soldiering.

Now why have I lingered on this? Why have I spoken about Vietnam, about my shaky early experience? Am I trying to ingratiate myself with you on the cheap? Yeah, sure I am. (Laughter.) But there are serious points that I want you to take away from this experience, points that may apply to our country as well as to our individual lives. Perhaps the most important is that it really does take all kinds to make a world, and Steve touched on this earlier -- scholars, soldiers, policymakers. Not all of us are cut out to be scholars or a soldier or policymaker.

And that's fine, because American freedom, American democracy, requires all sorts of people, all sorts of partnerships, between policymakers and universities, between scholars and soldiers. Our different talents unite to form our nation's strength.

This is a truth that also applies to the affairs of state. Making American foreign policy involves a mix of perspectives and experiences, as well. On the Bush Administration national security team, the diversity of our talents, I believe, forms our strength. We are a strong team, and the President is the leader of that team. It is his foreign policy, driven by his vision of a better world, a better world that we can help shape. It is a vision that is firmly rooted in the values, hopes and principles of the electorate, the people, the American people who brought him to high office.

But a vision isn't enough. The President needs a strategy to design and execute foreign policy. And by strategy, I don't mean 19th century ""grand strategy,"" that classical kind of strategy that used to be characteristic of an imperial sense of the world. And the reason I don't mean that is because the United States does not seek a territorial empire. We have never been imperialists. We seek a world in which liberty, prosperity and peace can become the heritage of all peoples, and not just the exclusive privilege of a few.

And by strategy here, I do mean the translation of the President's vision into policies, policies that are coherent and that will appeal to the needs of the world, the desires of people in need throughout the world. And the translation requires the establishment of priorities, and that's critical because it is through priorities that a foreign policy strategy transforms vision into reality. President Bush has a vision. He has established priorities. His policies are unified by a strategy -- which was laid out publicly about a year ago in a document called the National Security Strategy of the United States.

The National Security Strategy gained attention in the aftermath of 9/11 because it made explicit the concept of preemption -- and it made it explicit for obvious reasons. As the President says, and as anyone can understand, if you can see a clear and present threat, a danger coming at you, you do not wait for it to arrive. You deal with it. You preempt. You don't wait for it to strike. It is not a new concept, but it took on new meaning in light of the changed world we faced after 9/11.

But the President's National Security Strategy covers far more than just preemption.

Above all, the President's strategy is a strategy of partnerships. It strongly affirms the vital role of the partnerships that we have throughout the world -- our partnership with NATO, our partnership with the United Nations and with so many other precious alliances that we have created over the last 50 years.

And the President's strategy doesn't rest on old alliances. It calls for new partnerships, new alliances, to meet new challenges.

Some new partnerships are global in scope, and quite different from the old-fashioned security kinds of partnerships. I have in mind here the Global Trust Fund that we helped set up with the United Nations to fight the scourge of HIV/AIDS around the world. HIV/AIDS: the greatest killer on the face of the Earth today, the greatest weapon of mass destruction on the face of the Earth today. And the President has made this a centerpiece of his foreign policy strategy.

Other new things we are doing are regional, such as our Middle East Partnership Initiative, which provides assistance for educational, economic and political reform throughout the Arab world, so that we can say to the Arab people of the world and Muslims throughout the world that there is no reason you cannot transform your society in a way consistent with your religion, with your beliefs, but also founded on the individual rights of men and women, founded on democracy and free market concepts.

Free trade and new American initiatives for economic development also figure prominently in the President's strategy. Just the day before yesterday I stood with the President in the White House as we celebrated the completion of work on free trade agreements with Chile and Singapore, and he signed the legislation bringing them into effect. The Free Trade Area of the Americas, the expanded Africa Growth and Opportunity Act, and especially the Millennium Challenge Account, which provides billions of dollars of new development assistance to those nations most in need, those nations who are committed to democracy and openness and the individual rights of their citizens -- all of these are important initiatives in the President's approach to the world and his strategy for executing the vision that he has for a world that is better, a world that is freer, a world that has something for every one of God's children.



The President's strategy is rooted, above all, in the promotion of freedom and dignity throughout the world. ""America must stand firmly,"" the President wrote, ""for the non-negotiable demands of human dignity: the rule of law, limits to the absolute power of the state, free speech, freedom of worship, equal justice, respect for women and ethnic tolerance, and respect for private property."" Simple values so well known to us. We stand by these values. We share these values with the world, not for the purpose of imposing them on the world, but for the purpose of letting the light of our values shine before us so that others can see and learn from them.



Our efforts to control the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction are also an essential part of the President's strategy. These efforts led this past May to the Proliferation Security Initiative, an 11-nation effort, 11 nations coming together, and more will join, coming together to seize weapons of mass destruction-related materials that are in transit to countries of concern.

President Bush's strategy also demands that we play a role in helping to solve regional conflicts, that we not just sit back behind our oceans and not take note of problems that are out there that we can play a leadership role in solving. Not only do such conflicts cause so much suffering, they can spread. They can spread to envelop societies that are now at peace -- and they can stoke the fires of terrorism, as well. And nowhere is the American role in helping to resolve regional conflicts more important than in bringing Israelis and Palestinians to a stable peace settlement.

We have a plan. It's called the roadmap, and we stand by that roadmap. That roadmap has been agreed to by the Israelis and the Palestinians. It has been endorsed by an organization that we created, a new partnership we created, called the Quartet -- the United States, the United Nations, European Union, the Russian Federation. Also, Arab nations joining in support of the roadmap. Since the President brought the parties together at Aqaba, where they all came together to endorse the roadmap, we have made some progress down the road the peace. But not enough, and we need to redouble our efforts. We need to keep the pressure on both sides to do everything they can to get to that point where Israelis and Palestinians can live side by side in peace, Israelis in the state of Israel and Palestinians in a state of their own called Palestine.

It has not been an easy journey so far, and it will not be easy as we move ahead. Many problems remain. We support Palestinian Prime Minister Abbas' efforts to consolidate security forces all under his authority so he could go after those terrorist organizations within the Palestinian community who are destroying the dreams of the Palestinian people. We support Prime Minister Abbas' efforts to make sure that all financial authority and all financial resources are under his office so they can be used to benefit the Palestinian people and not be diverted to other purposes.

This is the way to stop, once and for all, Palestinian terrorist organizations like Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad from making peace itself a hostage to their hateful ambitions. This is the way to rebuild the Palestinian society and the Palestinian economy on a sound basis to benefit all Palestinians. This is the way to a Palestinian state.

Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad and similar organizations must be isolated. The entire international community must come together to isolate them, brand them as terrorists, and do everything we can to cut off all of the funding that has been going to these organizations over the years. Unfortunately, Chairman Yasser Arafat has not been playing a helpful role. He has not been an interlocutor for peace over the years. His actions do not move the parties farther down the road to peace.

Also unfortunate is the fact that while it takes two to make peace, it takes only one to prevent peace. If either of the parties turns away from its obligations under the roadmap, both will slide into a ditch or tumble over a cliff. Neither the Palestinians nor the Israelis like everything about the roadmap, but neither has an alternative that is both available and better.

The roadmap is sound, we stand by it, and we know the travelers will get to their common destination -- to peace -- if they follow that map.

Conflicts in other regions have also demanded our attention, and our compassion. The United States is engaged in so many places in the world to try to achieve solutions to regional conflicts. Whether it's in the Sudan or the Republic of Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo, we are hard at work. Most recently, we helped our friends in Africa bring the situation in Liberia under control. We supported ECOWAS, an African organization, West African states coming together. They came up with a political solution, they provided the troops to go in. We provided the support, the supplies, and a limited number of American troops to show our commitment, to show our dedication to this peacekeeping mission.

Now with our African friends, and with the United Nations and with the Liberians themselves, we are helping them to create a new government, a responsible government, to care for the needs of a desperate people.



But despite the breadth of our strategy, despite our policy concerns and the accomplishments that I think we've achieved, it is natural that the recent focus of U.S. foreign policy has centered on the global war against terrorism. Terrorism is a problem that has been there for years, but it hit home here on September 11th, 2001, whose second anniversary we will solemnly mark next Thursday. An outraged American people understandably wanted those responsible brought to justice.

And the President set us on the task not just to get the killers of 9/11, but to instead lead a global campaign against all terrorism, against all terrorists. He did this because he understood that terrorism is not just America's problem; it is everyone's problem, it is a problem for the civilized world, and the civilized world had to come together under his leadership to deal with it. Just in recent months, terrorist attacks have made far too many headlines, in far too many places. In a resort in Bali. In a bus full of children in Jerusalem. In a Bombay marketplace. At the United Nations headquarters in Baghdad. In front of a sacred mosque in Najaf, Iraq.

Our grief knows no borders. Neither does our determination to put an end to such outrages against innocent people. The war on terrorism is our number one priority, and it will remain so for as long as is necessary.

We are succeeding in the global war on terrorism. We are making progress. The victories of our armed forces in Afghanistan and Iraq form part of that success. So do quieter diplomatic victories that you may not hear about, or intelligence victories or legal victories, law enforcement victories, as we go about the world, go around the world, to go every country and encourage them to participate in shutting down funding of terrorists, making sure that we share intelligence and law enforcement information, so we can get to them, root them out, and make sure that they do not have the opportunity to conduct new terrorist attacks.

Our reconstruction and humanitarian efforts translate military victory into lasting political accomplishments, and we are doing that in Afghanistan and Iraq. Our efforts will not cease. They will not falter. We will not fail. Military victory is only part of the solution. It's the reconstruction that comes afterward that leaves us with a lasting peaceful situation.

In Afghanistan, both the political reach and governing capacities of President Karzai's administration are expanding. Roads and schools are being built. Dangerous land-mines are being cleared away. A national army and police force are coming into being. A state is being rebuilt before our eyes from the ashes of war and chaos.

We know that Afghanistan's challenges are too great to be overcome overnight. So the United States is determined to help for as long as it takes to overcome them, and we are asking other nations to join us in this effort. We will be accelerating in the next several weeks our support for Afghan development, and others around the world will be generously adding to their original contributions -- and not just with money. As you know, NATO assumed responsibility for security in Kabul just last month. One of our great partners, NATO, realized that even though NATO is a European-North Atlantic organization, it now has new responsibilities it must meet in parts of the world that could never have been contemplated NATO would have to participate in when the organization was formed so many years ago.

Afghanistan remains a dangerous and an unsettled place. But the remnants of the Taliban regime and of al-Qaida will be rooted out. And, together with our allies and the Afghan people themselves, Afghanistan will be rebuilt.

In Iraq, too, it is impossible to overcome in only a few months obstacles that have been decades in the making. Every day makes clearer how horribly the Iraqi people suffered under Saddam Hussein and the Baath Party. Their national resources were diverted. The oil treasure that they had was wasted as the regime spent the money on weapons, participated in the mass production of fear, repression, and the perverse luxuries of its insatiable elite. The mass graves that are now being opened up for the whole world to see bear witness to Saddam Hussein's brutality. Let there be no doubt in anyone's mind that we did the right thing, that the world is better off without this despotic regime.

And now the remnants who have been left behind are still acting in character, still acting in a despotic manner, trying to destroy the hopes of the Iraqi people, and destroying water and oil pipelines. They are attacking humanitarian workers in the international community that has come there to help the Iraqi people. They are trying to deny the Iraqi people the fruits of their liberation. But they will fail.

Some foreign terrorists, too, are coming to Iraq to help Iraq's own dead-enders with their destructive work. They will fail, too. Coalition forces are ready for them. We will find them. We will isolate them. And then they will be destroyed.



The forces of destruction, the forces of the tragic past, will not stop us. Together with our allies and, most of all, together with the Iraqi people, we are undoing the disasters of Saddam Hussein's misrule.

Electrical power is returning. On August 27, generating capacity reached 3,700 megawatts and will soon go over 4,000 megawatts, which was the amount of electricity that was there before the war.

All of Iraq's universities are open and most of its secondary schools are now open as well. Since the end of July, all of Iraq's major hospitals have been up and running, as have 95 percent of local clinics. Stocks of medicine and medical technology are being rapidly replenished.

The oil industry is getting back on its feet. Oil is now flowing out, money is flowing in. Crude oil production now averages between 1.4 and 1.7 million barrels a day.

Banks are making loans in Baghdad, employment is picking up, a free press bustles with energy and advertising. Of the country's 400 courts, 300 have now reopen. Approximately 46,000 police have been hired, and another 28,000 new police will be trained over the next 18 months.

Progress is being made, and because the Coalition is making such progress, far more Iraqis worry about our leaving too soon than about our staying too long. They need not worry, for we will neither leave too soon, nor stay too long.

As you have been reading in your newspapers for the last several days, we have begun consultations with our Security Council colleagues on a new UN resolution concerning Iraq. In this resolution we will invite the Iraqi Governing Council to submit a plan and a timetable for them to write a constitution, develop political institutions, and conduct free elections. All of this leading to their resumption of sovereignty over their country, over their own people.

This is our single goal, our only goal, to allow the Iraqi people to regain sovereignty, but sovereignty based on democracy, sovereignty based on freedom, sovereignty based on peaceful existence with one's neighbors. This has been the President's goal from the very beginning, and this new resolution will move us further along toward that goal.

There are some of my Security Council colleagues who would like to move faster, some who say be a little more careful. We will listen to all of the comments that will be coming in, and we will try to adjust and adapt to those comments, as long as it is consistent with what I have just described as our overall goal.

The resolution would also authorize a United Nations multilateral force, with a U.S. commander. There's nothing unusual about this. With a force this size and with the majority of that force coming from one country, that country is the provider of the commander. And we have seen this model work on many occasions in the past and we are confident it will work now -- keeping in mind there are already 30 nations standing side by side with us in Iraq, and we hope with this new resolution more nations will be encouraged to become a part of this noble effort.



The resolution would also permit the United Nations to play a more comprehensive and active role in the transition back to Iraqi sovereignty. We are receiving suggestions, as I said, and I look forward to working with our 14 partners on the Security Council to produce a new resolution as quickly as possible.

But we are doing more than that. We are looking, at an Iraq donors' conference in Madrid in October to further mobilize international efforts to help the Iraqi people reconstruct their country and rebuild their lives.

Our efforts will augment and encourage the most important kind of progress that is being made in Iraq, which is political progress. Iraqis are organizing themselves in so many ways now for self-government. Many municipal and village councils are operating according to representative principles. The Iraqi Governing Council recently named a 25-man cabinet, which was sworn in on Wednesday. It is already beginning to govern.

Behind every statistic and every political accomplishment is something that is even more important: the end of fear, and a new spirit of freedom being born. That spirit is spreading far and wide. In the end, it will prove unstoppable. In the end, democracy will come to Iraq. In the end, those who are trying to stop -- those who are conducting these terrorist attacks, those who don't realize that there is a new wave sweeping over that part of the world, they will be dealt with.

And democracy will come to Iraq. And when it does, all those in the Middle East who are in thrall to their own fears of change will be faced with a choice. They can move forward with the rest of the world, or stagnate in their own insecurities. Those imprisoned, not by Islam, certainly, but by a lack of confidence in their societies' ability to embrace a better future, will no longer be able to intimidate others into joining their cabals of the closed-minded.

That is a day to which the many lovers of liberty in the Middle East look forward to. And I hope that as long as we remain engaged, as we lead an international coalition, they will not be disappointed.

That will be a great day, indeed. But our efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq are not without cost. I know that the President is deeply grateful, as are we all, for the outstanding service and the painful sacrifices that American men and women in uniform are making in Iraq and in Afghanistan. We are grateful, too, for the service and sacrifices being made by the soldiers of dozens of other nations who are also contributing to the effort.



Every loss of life, every wound, is a tragedy. But not a loss in vain. Not to face up to and fight the hatred that is at the core of all terrorism, is to be complicit in hatred's consequences. That we will never be. Every loss that we suffer becomes a stone in the citadel we are building against terrorism, and against hatred. None of these lives have been lost in vain. As the Secretary of State, as an American citizen and as a former solider, I am so enormously proud of those wonderful young men and women that you see out there doing their job every day on behalf of the Iraqi people, on behalf of the cause of freedom and in the global war against terrorism. I hope you are as proud of them as I am. (Applause.)

Afghanistan, Iraq and the Arab-Israeli conflict have absorbed much of our energy in recent months. But by no means all. Less well appreciated and less visible in the daily headlines is the other work that we are at, other work that we are succeeding at, in other important domains of U.S. foreign policy. Not least among these is the focus we have placed on better relations with the world's major powers.

The world is much changed since I was a soldier in Germany, Vietnam and later in Korea, or even when I was a soldier here at GW. The world changed profoundly in November of 1989, when the Berlin Wall was breached, never to be repaired. That date marked the end of the Cold War and, before long, of the Soviet Union itself.

Those events ended the epoch of intense and dangerous struggle between liberty and totalitarianism that had shaped most of the 20th century. For most of the 20th century, it was fascism versus democracy, communism versus democracy. The potential of more world wars, in addition to the two world wars that we saw.

All that has changed. All that is complete different. The President fully understands the essence of what this means. As he wrote in his National Security Strategy, ""Today the international community has the best chance since the rise of the nation-state in the seventeenth century to build a world where great powers compete in peace instead of continually prepare for war. Today, the world's great powers find themselves on the same side.""

This is good news. For too many years, too many centuries, the imperial habits of great powers squandered untold resources and talent and lives jousting for real estate, glory and gold. Instead of wasting lives and treasure opposing each other as in the past, today's powers can pull in the same direction to solve problems common to all. If we do pull together, we will begin to redeem history from so much human folly.

One of those common problems, of course, is terrorism. We do not see the war against terrorism and the nurturing of constructive relations with the major powers as competing tasks. They are complementary. We conduct the war on terrorism with an eye toward greater major power cooperation. And we seek enhanced great power cooperation with an eye turned toward success in the war on terrorism.

The logic of this approach rests in the fact that terrorism threatens world order itself. But by so doing, it creates a common interest in defeating terrorism among all the powers of the world that value peace, prosperity and respect the rule of law. That common interest is one source of a rare and remarkable opportunity: America's chance to enjoy for the first time in a hundred years excellent relations with all the world's major powers simultaneously.

Of course, we have a head start in this, for America is blessed with many enduring great power friendships. None of these are more important than those great power relationships represented in NATO.

Some observers predicted when I was here as a student that NATO would wither after the Cold War, and that the United States and the European Union would end up on a collision course. It has not been so, and will not be so. I remember when I was Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on my last occasion here, people were saying, well, you know, ""Why do we still need a NATO?"" Some of my Russian general friends were saying, ""Look, if the Warsaw Pact goes away,"" they were saying in the early '90s, ""why do you still need NATO? No Warsaw Pact, no Soviet Union, no NATO."" And my answer was, ""It's hard to close a club where people are still asking for membership applications."" (Laughter.)

And so rather than withering, NATO has thrived. It's grown, gone from 16 to 19, now to 26 nations this coming year. And as for our relations with the European Union, never has our common agenda been so large and mutually beneficial -- from advancing free trade to counter-proliferation efforts.

And so let there be no doubt that the partnership we have with our European friends is a strong partnership. Yes, it is true that we have differences with some of our oldest and most valued NATO allies. But these are differences among friends. The Transatlantic partnership is based so firmly on common interests and values that neither feuding personalities nor divergent perceptions can derail it. We have new friends and old friends alike in Europe. They are all, in the end, friends, best friends.

That is why the President continues to talk about partnerships, not about polarities. Some authorities suggest that we must move to a multipolar world. But there need be no poles among nations that share basic values. We have no desire to create such poles, either. Indeed, we must work to overcome differences, not to polarize them.

We work hard to have the best relations with nations large and small, old and new. But it is important that we concentrate on those major powers, and especially on those with which we have had different and difficult relations over the years.

Our relationship with Russia and China and India fall into this category. And just look at where we are now. Our relationship with Russia has been dramatically transformed -- for the better -- since that November evening in 1989. Americans and Russians no longer point growing arsenals of strategic missiles at one another. Indeed, thanks to President Bush and President Putin's leadership, we are now radically reducing our strategic weapons' arsenals. In Moscow, we have a committed partner in fighting terrorism and in combating the spread of weapons of mass destruction worldwide.

U.S.-Russian commercial relations, too, have expanded, and will expand further to mutual benefit -- not least in the energy sector.

The new relationship that is developing between Russia and NATO, too, has real substance. From sharing intelligence on terrorism to working together to deal with humanitarian crises and peacekeeping tasks, the NATO-Russia Council is operational and working -- something that would have been absolutely unthinkable just 15 or so short years ago.

And that relationship with Russia can expand as far as our creativity and mutual effort will let it. We are closer than ever, with this new relationship with Russia and the other former republics of the Soviet Union, we are closer than ever to a Europe whole, free and at peace -- a Europe that definitely includes Russia, a Europe that will not in this century face the kinds of challenges that was faced in the century past.

Perhaps most important, American and Russian political and economic philosophies are converging. Russia today is more democratic than not. It is also more a market economy than not. We should be patient as Russia develops its democratic institutions, and as the painful hangover of Soviet-era corruption is rooted out and the rule of law firmly established.

We do not agree on everything. Earlier this year, we had hoped for a more supportive Russian attitude toward our Iraq policy. We still hope for more change in Russia's attitude toward the Iranian nuclear program. And we differ over aspects of Russian policy in Chechnya. But the relationship as a whole is no longer locked in knee-jerk antagonism. That's what is important. We now have the necessary level of trust required to solve even the most difficult issues that exist between us.

While Russia is still developing its democracy, India's democracy dates from its independence in 1947. And with recent economic reforms setting institutional roots, India is developing into a mature market economy. As Indians themselves are the first to admit, however, their country still faces many challenges. Illiteracy, poverty, many others, which hamper their progress.

We want to work with India. We want to help India overcome its challenges, and we want to help ourselves through a closer association with one of the world's richest and most ancient cultures. We have therefore worked very hard to deepen our relationship with India. The two largest democracies on earth are no longer estranged, as they had been for many years. At the same time, we have done this in a way that also allowed us to improve our relationship with Pakistan, a country with domestic challenges of its own.

Aside from their domestic challenges, India and Pakistan live with the legacy of their dispute over Kashmir. About 15 months ago, you will all recall, we were fearful of a major war breaking out on the subcontinent, possibly a nuclear war. A distinct possibility. So, once again, with our partners, we came together, and working with India and Pakistan we defused that crisis, and now we see the situation improving as they reach out to one another. And we look forward to helping them in every way that we can.

What the United States has done in South Asia is an example of ""turning adversity into opportunity"" -- to quote President Bush. In a different way, we have done the same thing with the other major power I'd like to touch on, China.

Sino-American relations didn't get off on the best foot in this administration. You will remember in April of 2001 there was an incident where we lost one of our airplanes in a collision with a Chinese plane and it landed on the island. We had a crisis on our hands. We got through that crisis in a two-week period, and every since then our relationship has been on the upswing, constantly going up. And today, I would submit U.S. relations with China are the best they have been since President Nixon's first visit.

This is not just because the 9/11 attacks led us to shuffle priorities. It's not just because we championed Chinese accession to the World Trade Organization. It's not just because a new generation of leadership is taking the Chinese ship of state in hand. It is certainly not because we've ignored basic differences we have with China on their human rights practices or their proliferation activities or the reluctance of China's leadership to match political reform to economic reform. We have not ignored these differences.

The relationship has improved for a reason that transcends all these particulars. It is that neither we nor the Chinese leadership anymore believe that there is anything inevitable about our relationship -- either inevitably bad or inevitably good.

We believe that it is up to us, together, to take responsibility for our common future. And we do not conceive that future in zero-sum terms. The National Security Strategy puts it directly: ""We welcome the emergence of a strong, peaceful and prosperous China."" And we seek a constructive relationship with that China. Indeed, we welcome a global role for China, so long as China assumes the responsibilities commensurate with that role.

Chinese leaders know all this. Neither false fear about the future nor the overhang of Cold War enmity prevents us from cooperating where our interests coincide. And a case in point concerns the Korean Peninsula.



American and Chinese interests in Korea may not overlap completely, but they do so considerably. Neither side wishes to see nuclear weapons developed and deployed by the North Koreans on the Peninsula. Neither side enjoys the specter of the chronicled debacle that is the North Korean economy. Neither side has any interest in a worsening refugee crisis on China's border. Neither side relishes a North Korean regime that runs drugs and weapons, and that counterfeits currencies, or that engages in the periodic extortion of its neighbors though brinksmanship military conduct. Neither side, to be sure, has any interest in another Korean war.

We have worked to transform our common interests with China into solid and productive cooperation over the challenges posed by North Korea. We are doing so, as well, in conjunction with Japan, Russia, and South Korea.

Our agenda is ambitious, but it is succeeding. The fact that we now have a six-party framework for talks over North Korea's nuclear program stands as testimony. Once again, we worked with partners. We found nations with like interests to ours with respect to Korea to come together and form this six-party grouping with includes the North Koreans. A very multilateral approach to diplomacy. And we very much appreciate the leadership role that the Chinese have played in trying to find a solution to this problem.

We still have a long way to go before we achieve success in dealing with North Korea's dangerous nuclear weapons program. We have no intention of invading or attacking North Korea, and we have told our partners and the North Koreans that. We have stated our intentions, openly and honestly: we want peace, not war; we want security, not fear, to envelop Korea and its neighbors. But we will not yield to threats and blackmail. We will not take any options off the table. Now is the time for North Korea to alter its behavior, to end its nuclear program in a verifiable manner.

I believe strongly that a diplomatic solution can be achieved, and when it has been achieved, we will have demonstrated that American diplomacy is designed to satisfy not only American national interests, but the interests of international security as well. We will show that the equities of other powers can be best advanced along with American ones, not in opposition to them.

And so we have a National Security Strategy that is based on a vision, a vision that includes strong partnerships, not unilateralism, but strong partnerships with our traditional allies and our new friends in the world stage. It includes a concern for the well-being of mankind throughout the world. We're investing in HIV/AIDS programs. We're doing everything we can with respect to economic development of developing nations, with respect to poverty elimination. It is a broad, broad, comprehensive strategy.

Ladies and gentlemen, our relations among the major nations of the world will remain a key structural element that will shape the future of international security. We must not take the present peace among the major powers for granted. That peace will not just take care of itself as time passes. We have to work at it, and we will. We will remain engaged.

Yes, of course we want to promote democracy in the world now. We want to help people raise themselves from poverty now. We want to transform the inadequate system of global public health now. We are in pursuit of these goals, too, now. But only if the deep peace of our era can be ""preserved, defended and expanded,"" can our long-term goals be achieved.

And make no mistake, these are the central goals of American foreign policy in the 21st century. We fight terrorism because we must. We seek a better world because we can, because it is our desire, it is our destiny to do so. That is why we devote ourselves to democracy, development, global public health, human rights -- as well as to the structure of global peace that enables us to pursue our vision for a better world.

These are not mere high-sounding decorations for our interests. They are our interests. They are the purposes that our power serves.

Because this is so, I know that America's reputation for honesty and compassion will endure. Today America's motives are impugned in some lands. But as we ""preserve, defend, and expand"" the peace that free peoples won in the 21st century, I believe we will see America vindicated in the eyes of the world, speedily in our time, in the 21st century.

That vindication will not come not only because of one man or one administration. It will come to America, to its true friends and allies, and to all of us -- including the scholars and students of the Elliott School, as we work together in partnership, the kind of partnership that your chairman and dean and your president has spoken about.

And friends, I would be remiss in this presentation if I did not close it with a personal note.

This university opened up a world for me, a new world. I first came here as an Infantry Lieutenant Colonel having spent, at that time, something like 12 years in uniform in solid infantry work. And I came to GW and found my horizon widened, my mind opened. I learned so much here that was so tremendously useful to me as I went on to different assignments.

I returned as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to receive an honorary degree from my alma mater. I learned more here than data processing and business technique. I learned about real management and genuine leadership. Most of all, as each and every one of the students here is learning now, I learned about my own potential. I discovered a part of myself I didn't know for sure was even there. And that's a lot to learn and I have an undying gratitude to the faculty of GW and to all who worked to make this institution so great.

I wish all of the students here the same opportunity for learning that I received here. I know that you will take advantage of the opportunity that is here.

I am so happy, so very happy to be here today to dedicate your new building, a building that will be serving noble purposes, the noble purposes for which it has been constructed. And I am so pleased to be a neighbor across the street. Now that you have put up the new building, now that you have shaped it, my young friends, may it shape you as you go from strength to strength. As you prepare yourself to become the new leaders of this great nation in the 21st century, GW will prepare you for that in an absolutely outstanding way. Of this, I am sure.

Thank you very much.

(Applause.)
