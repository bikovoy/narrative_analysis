Igor Ivanov,02-12-2003,MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION IGOR IVANOV ANSWERS A QUESTION FROM ITAR-TASS NEWS AGENCY REGARDING THE CROSSING BY CHECHEN GUNMEN AND TERRORISTS OF THE RUSSIAN-GEORGIAN BORDER,"The visit of President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin to India is a major event in relations between our countries.
It is the second time that the head of the Russian state is visiting India, with which we are traditionally tied by close bonds of friendship and cooperation, which have in recent years attained the level of a genuine strategic partnership. One can state with satisfaction that the agreements recorded in the Declaration on the Strategic Partnership, signed in October 2000, are being successfully implemented. Along with the regular meetings of the leaders of the two countries, ties have expanded between the parliaments, between the highest judicial bodies, between the security councils and between various ministries and departments.
Russia and India are united by the commonality of approaches to key international problems of today. Our countries stand for the formation of a democratic multipolar system of international relations in which the security and sustainable development interests of all states would be reliably ensured. That mutual understanding is particularly important in the conditions when the world community is faced with new global challenges and threats, which can only be countered by combined efforts, through mechanisms of multilateral and bilateral cooperation.
In the first place this applies to the struggle against terrorism, which has now moved into the category of major international priorities. The recent terrorist acts in Moscow, Indonesia, Kenya and a number of other countries of the world have once again revealed the global character of this threat. They confirm that the world community has a tough and long struggle against terrorism ahead, in which it is necessary to use the broadest set of measures.
For Russia and India, international terrorism has never been an abstract theoretical notion. Long before the tragic events of September 11, 2001, in the United States, our countries had sought to attract attention to this problem and were pointing out the international character of terrorist organizations.
Today ties between the terrorists operating in Chechnya, Afghanistan, Kashmir, the Philippines and other parts of the world have become a generally accepted fact. It is well known that they have undergone training in the same camps and are using similar crime tactics and methods. Enough to recall the apartment houses explosions in Moscow and Volgodonsk, the blast at the Jammu and Kashmir legislative assembly in Srinagar, the attacks on the Indian parliament in December 2001 and the Hindu temple in the Indian state of Gujarat this September or the recent hostage-taking by Chechen terrorists in Moscow.
The basic principles of Russian-Indian cooperation are reflected in the Moscow Declaration on International Terrorism of November 6, 2001. Russia and India presume that the central role in combating the terrorist threat must belong to the United Nations. We are for the adoption on the basis of the principles and rules of international law, primarily the United Nations Charter, of drastic measures against terrorists and the states which support, harbor, finance, instigate, train or assist terrorists in any other way. At the same time we see the full danger and counterproductiveness of an oversimplified approach to the problem of terrorism and of attempts to identify it with individual ethnic groups or religious denominations.
Neither can we help but be concerned by the striving of individual countries to employ the slogans of combating terrorism for solving opportunistic foreign and internal policy tasks.
The problem of terrorism and possible joint actions in the fight against this evil are being actively discussed between various ministries and departments of our countries, including between the foreign and interior ministries, between the Security Councils within the framework of the Working Group on Countering Terrorism, and so on.
Russia and India actively helped the liquidation of the dangerous hotbed of instability in Afghanistan. A continual confidential dialogue on Afghan problems is being conducted between us.
An important role in it belongs to the Russian-Indian Working Group on Afghanistan, established in 2000. Our views on a post-conflict arrangement in the country fully concur. An undoubted priority now is economic reconstruction and the ensuring of security. Seriously worrying are the incoming reports about the growth of drug production on the territory of Afghanistan. It is well known that the proceeds from illicit drug trafficking constitute one of the main sources of financing for the internal conflict in the country, as well as for international terrorist organizations.
Cross-border terrorism is an acute problem for many countries. An essential precondition for the effective struggle against this threat is the close cooperation of neighboring states. In particular, for the security of Russia a grave threat is posed by the presence of Chechen terrorists and foreign mercenaries in the Pankisi Gorge on the territory of Georgia. In this connection we give special emphasis to the speediest possible implementation of the agreements of the Russian and Georgian presidents on reinforcing security in the Russian-Georgian border area, reached in the course of their recent meeting in Chisinau at the CIS summit.
For the same reasons Russia treats with understanding the concern of India over the penetration of groups of militants through the Line of Control into the state of Jammu and Kashmir. It shares the opinion about the need for the fulfillment by Pakistan of the obligations assumed to liquidate the terrorist infrastructure on the territory under its control.
Russia and India have always been advocating broad international cooperation in the struggle against the terrorist threat. They were among the first to actively support the creation of the international antiterrorist coalition. Favorable prerequisites are currently taking shape for getting down on the basis of this coalition to the formation under UN auspices of a global system of counteraction against new threats and challenges. Within the framework of this system practical measures can be worked out for the suppression by the international community of any manifestations of terrorism and for cutting off the channels for its financing and removing the socioeconomic causes engendering it. Important steps in this direction would, undoubtedly, be the adoption of a Comprehensive Convention Against International Terrorism and a Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism, as well as the consistent implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1373, primarily through the Counter-Terrorism Committee, specially established for reliable control over compliance with it. All these measures would contribute to strengthening the legal basis for combating terrorism, which is an essential precondition for its effectiveness.
It is the profound conviction that the struggle against terrorism must be waged in the legal field that makes our countries seriously worry about the developments around Iraq. They presume that the Iraqi crisis needs to be resolved by politico-diplomatic methods, on the basis of relevant UN Security Council resolutions.
It is perfectly clear that unilateral military action may lead to the origination of a dangerous crisis which can create a breeding ground for a new spiral of terrorist activity both in the region and throughout the world.
Russia has been invariably pursuing a line toward the development of constructive bilateral cooperation with India in all fields.
It is deeply interested in the further coordination of the efforts of our countries in the struggle against international terrorism. We are convinced that Russian-Indian cooperation in this field serves as a weighty contribution to bolstering international security and stability and is conducive to the establishment of an equitable world order meeting the aspirations of all peoples.",https://mid.ru/en/foreign_policy/international_safety/1618725/
Igor Ivanov,23-01-2003,"INTERVIEW WITH RUSSIAN FOREIGN MINISTER IGOR IVANOV GRANTED TO THE NEWSPAPER TRUD-7 PUBLISHED UNDER THE HEADLINE ""IGOR IVANOV: WE HAVE COME TO THINK IN A MORE PRAGMATIC FASHION"" ON JANUARY 23, 2003","The two-hour talk with Igor Ivanov at our editorial office sped by although the topic of the conversation was anything but a light-hearted chat. This owes much to the personality of our interlocutor whose professional and human standing in the Russian political elite precludes any speculations. Today we publish extracts from the conversation.

Question: Igor Sergeyevich, could you formulate the most pressing foreign policy tasks facing Russia, those that give the minister and the nation headaches?

Answer: Some tasks are of a strategic character and we have to work on them constantly. They are linked with the country's security, in the broad sense of the word, but there are also concrete areas, above all the fight against terrorism.

The second task is creating favorable external conditions for the solution of internal problems. Obviously, if the atmosphere and the climate around Russia improve, domestic problems are easier to solve.

An equally important task is to secure and protect the interests of Russian citizens and our fellow-countrymen abroad.

Regional crises remain a priority area for everyone.

It is necessary to strengthen the legal framework of the counter-terrorist activities, and to effectively interact both at the bilateral level and in multilateral forums such as the mechanisms of the CIS and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, contacts with the European Union and NATO. But I stress that it should be under the aegis of the United Nations, on strictly agreed legal principles so that counteraction to this global threat is not supplanted in some cases by interference in the internal affairs of sovereign states.

Question: What is the real extent of the threat to Russia on the part of the terrorist international? Some experts say that Russia will soon become the main target of terror.

Answer: Russia was probably among the first countries to have been confronted with an open challenge on the part of international terrorism -- in the North Caucasus. This was something that not everyone was willing to admit even after the terrorist acts of September 11, 2001. To this day the militants operating in Chechnya who are linked with extremist entities in other countries, including al-Qaeda, as has been proven by many facts, have not been put in the category of international terrorists. But we are assiduously explaining this point to our partners in counter-terrorist struggle.

I recently had talks with the Macedonian foreign minister and we saw completely eye-to-eye on this: if the situation around Iraq grows worse, if the military scenario goes ahead, the blast will roll not only over the Middle East, but will cover the Balkans and provoke a surge of activity among extremist forces in the Muslin population. And then the fragile balance existing now will be upset.

Naturally, the principled and firm stand that the President and Government of Russia take with regard to international terrorism provokes a corresponding reaction on the part of radical groups and organizations. So, let us call a spade a spade: international terrorism is a threat to our country.

Question: Do you have confirmation that the terrorists are directed from a single guiding center and that bin Laden and Saddam Hussein are birds of a feather and that the same methods should be used with regard to both of them?

Answer: One can hardly talk about a headquarters of the terrorist international but there is undoubtedly an established system of interaction between its elements. But having said that, we disagree that the failure to apprehend bin Laden should be compensated for by exposing Iraq as the chief evil on the planet. We say that in Iraq the international community has clearly formulated goals and tasks: the liquidation of mass destruction weapons, if such weapons are indeed found there. That task flows from all the resolutions of the UN Security Council. These documents never in any way mention a change of regime in Iraq. It is not within the competence of the United Nations to determine what regime should exist in what country.

If, upon the expiry of the fixed time period, the inspectors confirm that Iraq has no mass destruction weapons or that it has been discovered and then liquidated, then the logical followup will be to raise the issue of lifting the sanctions against Iraq.

Question: Some reports say that Moscow is trying to persuade Saddam Hussein to quit of his own accord and to go into exile.

Answer: We have never done that. These rumors are from time to time launched in the mass media of some countries in order to cast aspersions on our foreign policy. We have never stopped our contacts with Baghdad in order to know what the genuine sentiments and thoughts of Iraq's leadership are. We are discussing with them issues connected with the implementation of Security Council Resolution 1441. But talk about the withdrawal of Saddam Hussein which Russian diplomats are allegedly conducting in Baghdad is pure invention. Because if it had been true, it would have amounted to interference in the internal affairs of Iraq.

Question: What do you take into account in considering various scenarios for the settlement of the crisis in Iraq?

Answer: Nobody would presume to know the exact consequences of a military action against Iraq. We are examining different variants, including the aspects connected with the energy sector and how they may affect the interests of Russia. World oil prices do matter for us. We have economic interests in Iraq. But it would be wrong to say that these are the only and the decisive factors in the development of our positions. Our long-term interests involve the maintenance of global stability, the future of the United Nations, and, in a broad way, our interests in the Middle East and in the Persian Gulf. And one should not entertain any illusions that somebody could sacrifice his own interests putting Russian interests first. That is naive. One should look at things realistically.

Question: What is the biggest obstacle to finding an accommodation with our partners in the West and East? One of our students of Japan claims that it has much to do with the difference of mentalities. For example, the Japanese think in a different set of categories: new line of car design, conservation of bioresources, the development of the microchip. And they say that Russia is still in thrall to its great power past.

Answer: Even in the West they have recently talked less and less about our thinking in great power terms. I think we now think in down-to-earth categories and act pragmatically. Take the creation of the Russia-NATO Council. Is it a great power approach if we are engaged in a multilateral conversation not according to the formula of 19 NATO countries plus Russia, but in the format ""at twenty"" where all are equal and the decisions are taken by common agreement?

I can cite the example of our relations with the United States. Washington has availed itself of its right and withdrew from the ABM Treaty unilaterally. We could not prevent it doing so. So, there were two options open. Either to slam the door and quarrel and face confrontation. Or, to try and continue the dialogue and to reach an agreement, that would, if partly, compensate for the absence of the ABM Treaty and enable us to move forward toward reducing strategic offensive potentials. We chose the latter path. During George Bush's visit to Moscow we signed a document that addresses the strategic security interests of Russia.

Take the Middle East. If we stuck to our former positions, we would have continued to support one of the parties to the conflict or would have tried to act alone in order to underline our special position in the region. Instead, we have contributed to the creation of a ""Middle East Quartet"" where we proceed within the framework of agreed approaches together with the UN, the European Union and the US. We are not overemphasizing our contribution to the settlement of the crisis, but are steadily seeking to broaden the platform of cooperation.

Question: Could we elicit a more coherent reaction of the European Union on the visa problem around the Kaliningrad region?

Answer: For some reason, if a small country or a medium-sized country protects its legitimate interests, nobody accuses it of imperial ambitions and if this is done by the large Russia we are promptly accused of infringing upon somebody's sovereignty. It was not our intent to infringe on anyone's sovereignty in the negotiations on Kaliningrad. I might as well tell you that during the course of the negotiations, especially at the initial stage, no one could provide a coherent answer to our arguments which were clear, simple and legitimate. A person moves from one point to another inside his own country. Now there is a territory that has to be crossed by way of transit without stopping.

The Kaliningrad topic was in general excessively politicized. A public and largely futile discussion was initiated as to who had conceded more. And can more be achieved? Of course, we wanted more, and I am not hiding the fact. But I believe that all things considered we have achieved an optimal solution.

It's important to understand that the better our relations with the European Union, the easier it would be to move forward on the issue. We are currently negotiating with Lithuania an agreement on readmission, that is, the obligation to accept illegal emigrants back. The European Union countries have a concern about it, although we believe that Kaliningrad is not a point through which streams of illegal refugees flow. They come to Europe from the south, and not from the north. Even so, if a concern exists a legal basis should be worked out and interaction should be broadened between the ministries of the interior and the border services and then in future, I am sure, we can agree an even more simple procedure of transit from Kaliningrad and to Kaliningrad.

Question: How would you comment on the words of the US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld to the effect that ""with a GDP of Holland Russia should be very circumspect in its relations with the rogue states because by being too close with them it can scare off Western investments that Russia is seeking""?

Answer: We are not flirting with anyone. We proceed on the basis that the isolation of any state closes and not opens paths to the solution of problems. But dialogue with the leadership of North Korea, for example, has resulted in its missile and nuclear programs being frozen. But all sides must comply with agreements. Under the 1994 agreement, the US was to build two nuclear reactors in the DPRK, and pending their introduction to meet the country's needs for fuel by delivering mazut. They have not met their end of the bargain.

What should be the most reasonable tactics for the neighbors of the DPRK, and these include Russia which has every ground for being concerned about the current development of the situation around the Korean Peninsula? We can follow the path of threats, sanctions and blockade. The result may be a hardening of the positions of the sides. We offered dialogue from the outset and today we have the backing of Beijing, Seoul and Tokyo.

Question: You are well aware of the Western style of work between government agencies and the press. The impression is that there is still a shortage of openness as there have been attempts to avoid contacts not only with foreign but also with domestic media, and dodge explanations and commentaries on current events.

Answer: I understand that as a newspaper you want to be the first to ""fire away"" news with the Foreign Ministry's authoritative explanations. But there is one circumstance that must be taken into account: when an official of some ministry speaks, the Foreign Ministry can always ""correct"" him if there is some inaccuracy. When the Foreign Ministry assesses some event, it reflects the position of the state. Only the President may correct us. Hence the necessary additional time to analyze information and to coordinate with other agencies, if need be, and only then do we determine our position.

We have an interest in responding to events promptly because, as I very well understand, if we are not the first to respond and express our attitude, someone else will do that for us. Time will be wasted. Sometimes every hour counts: we have to make a statement and announce our position before people in America wake up.

Question: The Commonwealth of Independent States. Has it become a phantom body with no future?

Answer: There can hardly be a person who is satisfied with the present status of integration processes in the CIS. But for the sake of objectivity I must say that we have gone through different stages. After the disintegration of the Soviet Union we had quite influential political forces that thought we should take a different path, but Russia is a self-sufficient, strong and rich country and it will develop itself. Unfortunately, at the initial stage everybody took his own path. Over the past 10 years we had become very different countries. We realized what we were losing. We were losing economic ties that had been created over decades, and we were losing markets. The understanding dawned upon us that there was no reasonable alternative to integration within the framework of the CIS and other structures.

Question: What tools does the Foreign Ministry use in solving economic problems that face the country?

Answer: Our goal is to attract foreign investments and assist our companies in entering international markets. What does this depend on? First, it's the predictability of our foreign policy. It is important for our country to be perceived as a reliable partner. This will make it more important and attractive as an economic partner.

Second, it's the image of the country. Today the image of Russia has changed due to an active and constructive foreign policy. I remember my first tip to New York after appointment as foreign minister. Mainly I had to explain that we were not connected with the New York bank scandal. Finally I went to the New York Times office and said to them, If you accuse us of allowing so many billions to be taken out of the country, let's team up and you will help us return the money from American banks. But I did not see much enthusiasm on their part.

And third. As far as all the negotiations conducted by the President and the Government, including our ministry, are concerned, I can say that about half of the time is devoted to economic cooperation and to the political lobbying for the interests of Russian business, in the very good sense of this word.

Question: The Foreign Ministry has an elite staff that must be valued. There is a question of social protection and social support of Foreign Ministry employees. You can hardly be satisfied with the fact that many of your employees have a salary of 3,000 to 4,000 rubles and less.

Answer: First of all, the outflow of personnel in the ministry is not bigger than that in any other organization. We hired 109 institute graduates in 2000, 131 in 2001, and 169 in 2002. In other words, we have taken on more than 400 institute graduates in three years, and we have only 3,500 people working in the central office. These are graduates of 15 institutes, not only the Institute of International Relations and not only from Moscow. We select them on a competitive basis while they are still in school. But we have a certain shortage of personnel who left in the early 1990s. And we do feel this shortage.

Now the second side -- the salary. Young people are hired with a salary of 1,500 to 2,000 rubles. They know at least two foreign languages and they have a specialized education, be it law, economics and journalism. But this is not a question of the Foreign Ministry. They join public service, they are public servants like those in other ministries.

Following the latest decisions, the situation abroad has improved. We have introduced new UN wage categories and given up the old ones that were put in place in the 1930s and offered a standard basket that included felt boots and a fur collar, even though one worked in Africa. The government supported us. I cannot say that our salaries can compare with the salaries of diplomats in major countries, but it allows one to live decently and fulfill his mission. However the problem will remain until the quality of life improves in the country as a whole.

Question: Your predecessor sang a duet with Madeleine Albright as in traditional Foreign Ministry unofficial jamborees. Who of your colleagues from the informal ministerial club has been the easiest to deal with over these years?

Answer: We have only the ASEAN Regional Forum where such jamborees take place after the annual ministerial meeting and each delegation performs its own number. But we have an arrangement not to make this public. I can only say that our numbers performed in English are always a success, or so everybody says.

From the professional and human point of view, I feel most comfortable perhaps with Colin Powell. Although we haven't communicated much, I like the way he conducts negotiations and presents his thoughts that allows you to evaluate not only the situation but also possible allowances that can be made in the talks.

Question: How do you spend free time, if you have any, given your position and your workload? Do you have time to read a book, to watch a popular film or to leaf through a magazine?

Answer: Last year (according to a memo that has been prepared) I spent 112 days in foreign trips, during which I visited 31 countries and flew for 434 hours -- which is about 20 days. Frankly speaking, I don't go to theaters or movies, I read only when I have time and mostly things that are related to my work. When I have time I try to write. My third book has just been published and I am about to start writing another one. And when I fly, I work too.

I have many friends among culture people: Mstislav Rostropovich, Vladimir Spivakov and many others. Oleg Tabakov regularly invites me to his theater. But I have to disappoint all of them because shows begin at 7 o'clock in the evening when it is a morning in Washington and New York. At this time a report is usually prepared for the UN Security Council meeting or something else. This is the busiest time when positions have to be coordinated and telephone calls answered. You know, even my foreign trips have changed. There used to be a cultural program before. Now a visit lasts only several hours. Last Sunday, January 19, I flew to a Security Council meeting. It took place in the morning of January 20 and I immediately flew back because I had to be in Moscow for a meeting of the State Council on January 21.

Question: A few words about your family.

Answer: I am lucky because my wife is from a family of diplomats. I find complete understanding on her part. As for our daughter, she is married and she has her own life. My wife and I worked at the Institute of the World Economy and International Relations when I began as an aide to Nikolai Inozemtsev. That's where we met and got married. Then I was invited to work at the Foreign Ministry. She hasn't been working since then. I also have a sister. That's it.

Question: Diplomats are indeed a special category of people. I suppose most of your friends are also your colleagues?

Answer: Of course. But I still have many friends from the Suvorov Military School, from my childhood, and I maintain close relationships with them.

Question: Do you regret that you haven't made a military career?

Answer: My father was a military officer and my mother was too. This is why they sent me to the Suvorov Military School. I finished it but I did not continue the military career. I was rejected by a medical commission and I chose the Institute of Foreign Languages. What is there to regret if everything happened the way it happened?

Question: The Foreign Ministry celebrated its 200th anniversary last year. Everything began with the first Russian minister of foreign affairs, Count Vorontsov.

Answer: We have restored a small chapel and his family burial ground in the Vladimir region. We have also restored the tombs of many other ministers where we could. We will continue this work, including at the Novodevichy Monastery where five or six of our ministers are buried. But this is a sentimental side of the issue, although a very important one. A hundred years ago, in 1902, the History of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was published. We have republished it and, jointly with the Academy of Sciences, have put out a three-volume collection devoted to our 200th anniversary. Upon our presentation, in December 2002, the President endorsed Day of Diplomatic Workers that we had never had before. Now February 10 is our professional holiday.

Question: Why February 10?

Answer: On this day 450 years ago the Ambassadorial Office was created.

Igor Ivanov,23-01-2004,"TRANSCRIPT OF RUSSIAN FOREIGN MINISTER IGOR IVANOV'S REMARKS AND REPLIES TO MEDIA QUESTIONS AT PRESS CONFERENCE FOLLOWING TALKS WITH FRENCH MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS DOMINIQUE DE VILLEPIN, MOSCOW, JANUARY 23, 2004","Foreign Minister Ivanov:

I am very pleased to once again welcome the Minister of Foreign Affairs of France, Mr. Dominique de Villepin, to Moscow.

We are maintaining continual contact, but still - a visit is always a good opportunity to exchange views on a broad range of questions of a bilateral and an international character alike. This is particularly important now, when there exist many problems in the world that the international community has to solve, and the role of Russia and France as two United Nations Security Council permanent members, as two major players not only in the European, but also in the international arena is very great.

This morning Mr. de Villepin delivered at the Russian Foreign Ministry MGIMO(U) a very thorough report on France's position on key international problems. Once again I want to stress that the positions of our two countries are very close or coincide, both in approach towards global international problems and with regard to individual questions of a regional character.

In recent years relations between Russia and France have seriously advanced in virtually all fields, primarily thanks to the efforts of the presidents of the two countries. We are pleased with the fact that Russian-French relations are an important factor in the European area and in international relations as a whole. Moscow and Paris both have a firm intention to continue the course towards the development of bilateral cooperation and the construction of a new democratic, just and secure world order that exists in the interests of all the states and peoples.

Question: Mr. de Villepin has declared that an open war has been conducted in Chechnya for several years now. It is known that France supports the political process which is beginning in the Chechen Republic, but, on the other hand, France has made quite a few critical remarks. Could you also comment on the statements of a number of non-governmental organizations and, in particular, the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture, which draws attention to obvious human rights violations in Chechnya.

Foreign Minister Ivanov (speaking after de Villepin): First of all, I cannot agree with the formulation of the question, in particular, with the allegation that a war is going on in Chechnya. There is no war in Chechnya. A struggle is being carried out there against international terrorism. Moreover, if you want to see that for yourself, I am ready to help you organize a trip to the Chechen Republic so that you can assess the true state of affairs yourself. In the Chechen Republic there goes the very complex process of political settlement against the background of the fight against international terrorism.

An important symbolic event took place yesterday. Together with the Deputy Assistant Director General of UNESCO in the presence of the President of the Chechen Republic, the President of the Republic of Ingushetia and many other representatives of Chechen society and with the participation of the diplomatic corps we present a UNESCO plan for restoring the education system in the Chechen Republic. The plan had been prepared for two years. It is a comprehensive program aimed at ensuring that the young generation in the Chechen Republic is getting ready for a peaceful life. Today, when Mr. de Villepin was interested to know my evaluations of the developments in the situation in the Chechen Republic, I said expressly that the process of political settlement, however complex it may be, bears an irreversible character. First of all, this confidence arises from the concrete aspirations of the Chechen people for a peaceful life, as was demonstrated in the course of the elections and referendum held in the Republic. We are interested in Europe having an objective perception of the processes that are developing in Chechnya. I repeat to you my offer to organize your trip to the region.

Question: Were any specific steps discussed during the talks concerning the implementation of the Road Map?

Foreign Minister Ivanov: First of all, I want to say that the positions of Russia and France on Middle East settlement coincide. We consider that the Road Map is today the concrete plan that has been endorsed by the international community and which needs to be realized in practice. Its implementation must lead to the existence of two states in the conditions of security and peace. Unfortunately, now the translation of this plan into practice has reached an impasse. It is the common task not only of Russia and France, but also of the international community as a whole to ensure that this plan begins to be implemented. We are therefore engaged in intensive consultations both with the parties in conflict and with other members of the international community in order to achieve the start of progress in carrying out this plan. From Russia's point of view, it is crucial to reach a cease-fire agreement or understanding between the parties and to start a direct dialogue between Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and PNA Prime Minister Ahmed Qurei on specific steps towards implementation of the Road Map. In the course of my talks with the PNA Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Nabil Shaath, he expressed the Palestinian side's readiness for that. We also will be holding a dialogue with the Israeli side to induce it to arrive at such accords.

Question: Russia still has not ratified the Kyoto Protocol and the International Court Treaty. This question is at the center of the concept of France and the European Union regarding collective responsibility. What can you say in this connection?

Foreign Minister Ivanov: Russia has been advocating the strengthening of multilateral mechanisms in all fields. It is within multilateral mechanisms, above all, within the UN that basic issues of today should be dealt with.

As to the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, this questions continues to be in the stage of study of the various aspects, including likely implications of the signing of the Protocol for Russia's economic growth rates. This is not a question of relations between Russia and the European Union; it is a question which bears a broader character. I think it would be incorrect to say that the key to launching the Kyoto Protocol lies in the hands of Russia. There are a whole variety of other countries which have not ratified this protocol for some reasons or other. At the same time, I want to stress once more that in taking a decision concerning ratification we will primarily proceed from our own national interests, while at the same time taking into account the opinion of our partners and, above all, the European Union.

The International Court question also is so far in the stage of intra-agency consideration.

Question: Did you the discuss the question of the situation in Iraq? Was it about sending French and Russian troops to Iraq? Is it possible to take part in political and economic decisions in Iraq before the transfer of power to the Iraqis?

Foreign Minister Ivanov (speaks after de Vileppin): Russia is ready to participate actively in the process of resolving the situation in Iraq. But to do so, naturally, appropriate conditions must first be created. Over and above anything else, it is a complete restoration of the sovereignty of Iraq and the formation in the country of an independent democratic government. It is necessary in the first place to use the potential of the United Nations and there should be more active international participation in the process of settlement. And from this point of view we think holding an international conference would be very important that would make it possible to consider all the aspects of the resolution of the situation in Iraq, to draw up an appropriate program which would receive necessary international support and also to consider the questions of regional stability in broader terms.

Question: How do you regard the latest statements of US Secretary of State Colin Powell concerning Syria?

Foreign Minister Ivanov: Mr. Powell will be in Moscow on Monday. After this we shall hold a press conference and answer this question.",https://mid.ru/en/foreign_policy/news/1596482/
Igor Ivanov,27-02-2003,"REPLIES BY RUSSIAN MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS IGOR IVANOV TO READERS' QUESTIONS DURING AN ONLINE CONFERENCE ON THE RENMIN RIBAO WEBSITE, BEIJING, FEBRUARY 27, 2003","The live broadcast of the online conference of Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Igor Ivanov begins.

Renmin Ribao: How do you do, dear Internet users. I am Jiang Yaping, a correspondent of the newspaper. For us it is a great honor to invite Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Igor Ivanov. We all know that Mr. Minister is a very well-known person in China. Just now our leaders met with Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Igor Ivanov, and all our Internet visitors have already seen him on television. Mr. Minister kindly agreed to hold an online conference and I think that, apart from Chinese visitors, both Russian visitors and visitors from other countries will be together with us on the Internet. I want to express to you, Mr. Minister, big thanks for your visit.

Question: We know that a mechanism of regular meetings between leaders at various levels has already been created between China and Russia. There is the Treaty on Good-Neighborliness, Friendship and Cooperation, which was already signed more than a year ago. Just now the Minister met with our leaders. I well remember that in honor of the visit of Russian President Vladimir Putin to China Mr. Ivanov especially wrote an article in which he compared Sino-Russian relations with those between pine and bamboo. This article was published in Renmin Ribao and attracted everybody's attention. Therefore we would like to ask Mr. Minister to give us an assessment of Sino-Russian relations, of their state and development prospects.

Foreign Minister Ivanov: In the last few years relations between Russia and China have reached a qualitatively new level of strategic partnership. The Treaty on Good-Neighborliness, Friendship and Cooperation, signed in 2001 between Russian President Vladimir Putin and PRC President Jiang Zemin, has created a solid legal basis for the development of these relations in the most diverse fields for the near term. We have a rich history and tradition of friendship between our peoples. We've got the political will to develop relations between our two countries. There is the solid legal basis for developing such relations. So we are looking into the future with optimism. Now our principal task is to fill Russian-Chinese relations with concrete content in all fields. Of special importance are the regular meetings of the leaders of our two countries, and such meetings are being planned also in 2003. In the future, of course, there is a great deal to be done for the development of trade-and-economic ties, and cooperation in the scientific-technical and other fields of mutual interest. But the main thing is that we perceive a clear perspective. Therefore I think that we have the right to compare relations between Russia and China with the pine and bamboo growing together, which do not interfere with each other but help and support each other.

Question: Since the signing of the Treaty on Good-Neighborliness, Friendship and Cooperation between the People's Republic of China and the Russian Federation more than a year has already passed. How do you assess the role of this Treaty in the development of bilateral relations in the context of the present international situation?

Foreign Minister Ivanov: Russia and China are two great world powers. We today have all the necessary conditions to energetically build on bilateral cooperation and to uphold effectively our interests on the international stage. The Treaty serves just this aim. It laid a solid foundation for the development of the Russian-Chinese strategic partnership for the long term. This partnership is not directed against anybody but is called upon to serve the interests of international peace and stability. We note with satisfaction the growing dynamics in our political dialogue at the highest and high levels, the substantial growth of trade-and-economic ties, and the strengthening of the coordination of our efforts on the international stage. All of this has become possible to a significant extent thanks to the signing of the Treaty.

Question: How, in your opinion, should the Shanghai Cooperation Organization show its special role in the international struggle against terrorism?

Foreign Minister Ivanov: The Shanghai Cooperation Organization is becoming an important factor in the maintenance of peace, security and stability in the region, and in the long term can play the role of one of the major pillars of a multipolar world pattern. As to cooperation in the struggle against terrorism, it constitutes one of the main lines of activity of the Organization. Under SCO auspices, the Shanghai Convention on the Combating of Terrorism, Separatism and Extremism has been developed and the Agreement on the Regional Antiterrorist Structure (RATS), which will have its headquarters in Bishkek, has been signed. Measures are being taken to suppress drugs contraband and other forms of transnational crime. A major practical task at this stage is the start of the work of the Executive Secretariat of the SCO in Beijing and of the Regional Antiterrorist Structure headquarters in Bishkek. This will help unfold fully the potential of the SCO in the struggle against terrorism. Thus, the SCO from its regional corner seriously bolsters the efforts of the UN and of the global antiterrorist coalition towards eliminating the terrorist danger in the world. We highly appreciate the role of China and other SCO member states in building on the antiterrorist dimension of the activities of this organization. Russia will continue to do everything possible to strengthen this direction of SCO cooperation.

Question: Please tell us about the significance of China-Russia cooperation in solving major international issues, in particular, the ""Korean nuclear problem"" and the Iraq problem.

Foreign Minister Ivanov: The coordinated stand of Russia and China on key international problems is an important factor of security and stability in the world. Following my talks with PRC Minister of Foreign Affairs Tang Jiaxuan two Russian-Chinese joint statements on the Iraq problem and on the situation in the Korean Peninsula have been published. They set forth the approaches of our countries to these immensely complex and as of now the most acute international crises. It is well-considered approaches, well-argued, correct from the viewpoint of international law and suggesting concrete steps for a resolution of those problems. Russia and China are staunch supporters of a resolution of the Iraq problem by politico-diplomatic means in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 1441 and of continued international inspections in Iraq. Most states of the world share that approach. And one simply cannot but agree with this. With regard to the situation in the Korean Peninsula, Russia and China proceed in their assessments from common principles. We favor a denuclearized status for the Korean Peninsula and the preservation of the regime of nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction here. Our countries regard the establishment of a constructive and equal dialogue between the USA and the DPRK in order to resolve the ""North Korean nuclear problem"" and to provide security guarantees for the DPRK as a priority. In a word, our countries stand adamantly for a politico-diplomatic solution of international problems, including such complicated ones as the Iraq and Korean issues, on the basis of strict respect for the Charter of the United Nations and international law. And the voice of such authoritative, influential powers as Russia and China cannot fail to be heeded.

Question: A Draft Constitution of Chechnya will be submitted to a nationwide referendum next month. Mr. Minister, please tell us about the current state of, and prospects for the counter-terrorist struggle in Chechnya.

Foreign Minister Ivanov: Indeed, on March 23, this year, the draft of a new Constitution and bills on presidential and parliamentary elections will be submitted to a referendum in the Chechen Republic.

This referendum, as well as the elections for President and Parliament of the Chechen Republic will constitute major stages on the road leading to a political resolution of the situation in the republic. The Russian leadership presumes that this process has already assumed an irreversible character and assists its development in every possible way. In so doing we act with maximum transparency, we are open for cooperation with international organizations. Thus, observers from the OSCE and the Council of Europe have been invited to the referendum in Chechnya. There will also be observers from the CIS. Of course, such developments are not to the liking of the terrorists who have entrenched themselves in Chechnya and of their backers abroad.

Even though individual attacks by gangs of bandits still persist, they are being suppressed and will continue to be suppressed by security agencies. However it can safely be said that it is not terrorists who set the tone in Chechnya at present. The Chechen people want a peaceful life, and they are receiving the opportunity to say so loud and clear at the referendum.

Question: How will you comment on the question of the East Turkestan movement?

Foreign Minister Ivanov: In our firm conviction, there must be no place for ""double standards"" in the fight against terrorism. Like Chechen bandits, fighters of the movement for the creation of a so-called state of East Turkestan should be regarded as international terrorists and in no way otherwise. Both represent interconnected cells of the common ""terrorist International,"" with which an uncompromising struggle has to be waged.

We welcomed and actively backed the decision of the UN Security Council to include the East Turkestan Islamic Movement terrorist organization in the List of the UN Committee on Anti-Taliban Sanctions. We hope that soon there will be added to this list the structures incorporating Chechen terrorists. The exchange of information and mutual support in these questions meet the interests of Russia and China and of the world community as a whole.

Question: Do you think the moment will arrive when a military resolution of the Iraq question becomes unavoidable? What is the latest position of Russia on the use of force against Iraq?

Foreign Minister Ivanov: The situation around Iraq continues to grow tense. It is no secret that different countries evaluate differently the conclusions of UNMOVIC and IAEA, drawn from the results of the two and a half months of inspection and monitoring activity in Iraq with regard to the extent of fulfillment by Baghdad of its obligations arising from UN Security Council Resolution 1441. We hold that the Iraqis have established constructive relations with the inspectors, are providing the conditions that generally contribute to the effective carrying out of checks, and are taking definite steps to make their cooperation with UNMOVIC and IAEA more proactive. We expect that this will in the end help remove the questions still outstanding on Iraq's WMD potential.

Therefore at this moment Russia sees no grounds for raising the question of applying measures of force-based influence against Iraq. Our position is also shared by other members of the UN Security Council, among which your country, France, the FRG, Syria and others. In this connection we consider it necessary to continue to make energetic efforts, directed to carrying on the process of Iraqi settlement on a politico-diplomatic plane.

Question: Nearly all the CIS countries have joined the NATO Partnership for Peace program, and many of them are anxious to enter NATO. What is your assessment of this situation?

Foreign Minister Ivanov: The situation in the world has been rapidly changing, especially in the last few years. The international community is now faced with new challenges, which are seriously threatening general security. Based on the new tasks, the UN and other international organizations are determining their priorities and adapting themselves to the present-day realities in order to enhance the effectiveness of their activities.

The Partnership for Peace program in the form in which it was created can hardly help solve such urgent problems for all the member states as fighting terrorism, checking the spread of WMDs, and counter other threats. This being so, the program will have to be substantially transformed, or it is unlikely to have any serious future.

On the other hand - it is the sovereign right of any state to participate in some or other organizations if it considers that this meets its national interests.

Question: How do you assess the US military presence in Central Asia?

Foreign Minister Ivanov: We view the US military presence in Central Asia through the prism of the efforts by the antiterrorist coalition to eliminate the illegal Taliban regime that existed in Afghanistan, which had turned that country into a bridgehead of international terrorism. We presume that the duration of the stationing of the forces of nonregional countries on the territories of Central Asian states has to be synchronized with the presence in Afghanistan of the international security force, the timeframe for which will be established by the United Nations Security Council.

Question: What specific measures will Russia be taking for the further strengthening of comprehensive cooperation with China, especially in the field of the economy and trade?

Foreign Minister Ivanov: We note with satisfaction that positive changes are currently occurring in bilateral trade-and-economic relations. The volume of trade has reached a record level of almost 12 billion dollars, and prospects exist for its further growth. Important contracts have been concluded and are being implemented in the fields of nuclear energy and civilian aviation equipment and in the fuel and energy sector. The activities of several technoparks in China and Russia are unfolding that specialize in the use of Russian technologies. Cooperation has begun in the telecommunications sphere and in the aluminum industry.

The energy sector is coming to the fore in economic cooperation with China. Gazprom will participate in the construction of the trans-China West-East Gas Pipeline, as well as in the related projects for gas production and the creation of a gas distribution system in China. Chinese companies are exploring the possibility of participation in the development of oil fields on Russian territory. A number of large bilateral and multilateral export projects involving China are being worked at, which will be implemented with regard to the integrated Russian program of utilizing the oil and gas resources of Siberia and Russia's Far East.

Recently Chinese business circles have come to show an enhanced interest in the possibilities of investing in the Russian economy in such areas as the assembly of household electric appliances and high technologies. At present several pilot Chinese investment projects are expected to be selected, to which the necessary assistance will be rendered at all levels.

It is important that the sides are beginning to regard each other as strategically important markets, and that there grows the interest of companies of the two countries for work respectively in Russia and China. In a word, trade-and-economic cooperation between our two countries is coming onto the road of sustainable and dynamic development, thus strengthening the material base of the entire range of bilateral relations and imparting to them a long-term and stable character.

Yet it should be realized that we can achieve considerably more, for China's share of Russian foreign trade amounts to a mere 5 percent, and the share of our country in Chinese foreign trade is even less - 2 percent.

The main lines of further advancement of bilateral trade-and-economic cooperation, apparently, should incorporate the stabilization of supplies of traditional commodities, which now form the basis of the bilateral trade turnover (chemical fertilizers, ferrous and nonferrous metals, agricultural products, consumer goods), as well as a substantial increase of the portion of engineering and high tech products and the expansion of investment cooperation. Consistent work is necessary to consolidate and develop the emergent network of economic relations between Russia and China and to impart to our cooperative effort a more comprehensive and balanced character.

Igor Ivanov,07-08-2002,MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION IGOR IVANOV ANSWERS A QUESTION FROM ITAR-TASS NEWS AGENCY REGARDING THE CROSSING BY CHECHEN GUNMEN AND TERRORISTS OF THE RUSSIAN-GEORGIAN BORDER,"Question: The Russian side officially invited Tbilisi jointly to investigate the facts of the illegal crossing by gunmen and terrorists of the Russian-Georgian border on August 3 and 5 and ensure their extradition. How did the situation develop afterwards?

Answer: Moscow promptly reacted to the statement by the Georgian President of readiness to consider positively the question of the extradition to the Russian side of the terrorists detained on the Russian-Georgian border. In accordance with the instruction of President Vladimir Putin the Prosecutor General, Vladimir Ustinov, flew urgently to Tbilisi. But Georgian authorities under a formal pretext refused to extradite the criminals. Once again the words of the Georgian leadership had conflicted with their deeds. Such an inconsistent stand of Tbilisi arouses bewilderment and concern. The question again arises - Do they in Georgia intend seriously to fight terrorism? This problem can't be solved with loud policy statements and half-hearted measures. And to what tragic consequences the policy of flirting with terrorists leads is well known.

Russia together with the overwhelming majority of states of the world is waging an irreconcilable struggle against international terrorism. We reiterate our willingness to lend Georgia all the necessary assistance to do away with the den of terrorism in the Pankisi Gorge. The extradition of the terrorists detained on the Russian-Georgian border must actually demonstrate how seriously Tbilisi is disposed toward such joint actions with Russia.",https://mid.ru/en/foreign_policy/international_safety/1618725/
