Madeleine Albright,20010203,"12/10/99 Albright interview on CBS's ""The Early Show""","







MR. GUMBEL:  The two countries have exchanged heated words over Russia's military action in the breakaway republic of Chechnya.

Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is in Washington.  Madame Secretary, good morning.

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Good morning to you, Bryant.

MR. GUMBEL:  Let me start with this listening device that was found.  It was found in a sensitive area, it was extremely sophisticated, it was professionally introduced, it was very well hidden.  Does all that pretty much guarantee that this spy, Gusev, had inside help inside your Department?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  I have no idea about that and I can't comment on that.  The investigations are going forward.  It is an investigation that first had to require counter-intelligence activity and now the other investigative part of this is going on.  And may I say that we have the most exemplary kind of cooperation now between the FBI and my Diplomatic Security Service and we are, obviously, deeply troubled by this.

But let me clarify something that you said.  It is in sensitive areas of the State Department.  We operate in a sensitive business.  But not in my office or in the offices where the highest level State Department officials operate.  And so we are concerned, we are investigating it.  I was told about this several months ago and we have followed a very, very careful procedure.

MR. GUMBEL: Let me move on to Russia, if I could.  I just characterized the relationship as icy.  What adjectives would you use?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  It's pretty chilly.  But let me just say this, it is very easy to have a chilly relationship with a country with whom we were at odds for 50 years.  The challenge here is how to manage a very complicated relationship with your former adversary and sort out where we have to be very tough, as we must now, on Chechnya because of the really unacceptable toll this is taking on civilians.  On the other hand, we have a lot of business to do with Russia in the arms control arena as well as in trying to deal with various issues around the world.

I talk to Foreign Minister Ivanov on a practically daily basis and we know that we have many points of conflict but we also have many points where we cooperate.

MR. GUMBEL:  The fact is, Russia has essentially consolidated its hold over Chechnya, surrounded the city, the capital city of Grozny.  Are we powerless to stop them?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  We are in physical terms.  But what has happened is that we have, and the Europeans, have made very clear that this is unacceptable behavior.

The other thing that we are telling them is that this is leading them down the wrong path.  What is necessary is to have a political dialogue and what's called the Chairman in Office, Foreign Minister Knut Vollebaek of Norway, of the OSCE is going on a mission now, next week, to Chechnya  to be able to help in some way to get a political dialogue started.

MR. GUMBEL:  The final area I want to talk about, and it is in part congratulating you because you recently succeeded in getting the Syrians and Israelis back to the bargaining table.  What kind of US assurances did you have to give them to get that done?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Basically, what they are interested in is an American role as an honest broker.  Both parties, both the Syrians and the Israelis, trust the United States and, particularly, President Clinton for his ability to be able to be an honest broker.  And so the talks are going to begin in the United States next week.  President Clinton and I are going to be intimately involved in it.

And the whole point here is that what we managed to do was to have them stop negotiating about negotiations and begin to talk about the substance.  But it's going to be tough slogging, I can assure you of that, Bryant.

MR. GUMBEL:  Were there no promises of US forces being used, being deployed to patrol borders?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  No promises have been made, no.  What we have said is that we consider having a comprehensive peace very important.  Obviously, we have played a part in the Israeli-Egyptian peace and the Israeli-Jordanian one and we have a role, as an honest broker.  And then we try to help as we can afterwards.

MR. GUMBEL:  Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.  Always a pleasure.

I assume I won't see you in the next two weeks so enjoy the holidays.

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Nice to see you, Bryant.  You, too.

Madeleine Albright,20010203,12/17/99 Albright press remarks following G-8 Foreign Ministers Meeting,"







SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Good afternoon, I think you have heard a great deal from my colleagues and Foreign Minister Fischer was able to give you a full account of the meetings that took place here.  As you know I did not arrive until this morning and so I just want to briefly tell you that the parts of the discussion that I participated in obviously involved Chechnya and I listened to the report from Foreign Minister Vollebaek about his trip to the region, discussion about Kosovo.

Then in terms of picking up on some of the discussions on conflict prevention, I specifically focused on our interest in limiting the spread of small arms, on the importance of developing a more robust and quickly acting civilian police, on the problems associated with the illegitimate trade of diamonds, in terms of perpetuating or creating the possibility for conflicts, general problems to do with terrorism and organized crime.

I also briefed my colleagues, in a general way, on the Middle East peace talks as President Clinton and I conducted them in Washington, between the Syrians and Israelis in the last couple of days.  So that is what we have done in the last few hours and I'd be very pleased to answer  your questions.

QUESTION:  There has been a lot of talk about conflict prevention by Foreign Minister  Fischer before you came in.  We have reports of some serious fighting in Grozny.  I was wondering if you would have any more to say than you said before about your position as regards international funding to Russia in this context?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: First of all, let me say clearly the issue of Chechnya and the fighting in Grozny did occupy some time this morning and I think that the vividness with which Foreign Minister Vollebaeck described the situation, made clear to all of us that there continued to be a great need for humanitarian assistance, better coordination, the ability of humanitarian assistance to get in there and the need for further political dialogue.

I think that it is very important for us to do everything we can to aid the humanitarian effort and I think that generally we, the international community and the United States also, have had an impact in terms of the humanitarian situation, pushing in order to have borders open, corridors created.  I think, frankly, we have had a marginal affect on the political aspect of this conflict.  I think there has been a recognition by the Russians of the importance for political dialogue and some contacts between the government in Moscow and various representatives of the rebel groups and President Maskhadov, and obviously  some recognition of the fact that the OSCE mission had an appropriate role and might in fact have a longer-term role there.  I think we have had no impact militarily, however, and that has been of concern, I think, to everyone.

What has been evident at this meeting, frankly, is that the Russians through their actions are self-isolating from the rest of the international community.  That was clear today.  And that to a great extent their lack of ability to face squarely what is going on and  extending the time for when there might be a solution, that they are losing credibility and international standing.   As we look at policy options I think the important point here is to try to keep explaining to the Russians what they could and should be doing and at the same time making sure that, in the case of the United States, that we continue to pursue our national interest, which is to have a functioning relationship with Russia.  I think we have to keep remembering that that is very much a part of our short, medium and long-term goal.

QUESTION: You said it was important to impress upon the Russians the need for a political solution.  If beyond the Duma elections there is no progress and they continue with their offensive against the Chechen rebels, would you see a point when it would be necessary to consider sanctions or other punitive measures in order to reinforce the message that you are sending today?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  I don't think it is useful to speculate on specific measures such as that.  All I am saying, and I think it is very important for people to understand this, is that this kind of action that the Russians are taking is isolating them -- as I said was evident in today's meeting.  Where in the past I think there have been G-8 meetings where we were all trying to solve something together, at this one there was a different mood because after Knut Vollebaek's report, the Russians were trying to explain -- I believe not sufficiently -- their actions.

I do think though that there is no question that continued action like this does have a serious affect even on our bilateral relationship, but at the same time, I would like to make very clear, as I just did, is that it is in our national interest to maintain a relationship with Russia.  It is a very important country with which we have a lot of business and that we have worked very hard to bring closer to all of us in the last years.

QUESTION:  (in French) Excuse me, I do not speak English very well.

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: (In French)  I speak French.

QUESTION:  (In French) Thank you.  After 500 years torture is a tradition in Turkey.  How much longer will this be possible? After 500 years we expect of Turkey -- and Turkey calls itself Europe or American -- can torture in Turkey be stopped or not? After 28 years Nelson Mandela is no longer a terrorist.  The question is President Nelson Mandela is not a terrorist.  Mr. Ocalan and after 28 years is not a terrorist, the president of Turkey or Kurdistan. Thank you.

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: (In French) I am not entirely sure I understood your question, but I have to say that the definition of a terrorist is someone who commits actions against civilians who have not done anything -- against innocent people.  I know there is a difficulty -- there are people for whom someone is a freedom fighter and for others he is described as a terrorist-- but for me it is not difficult if someone takes the lives of innocent people and what is happening now is that there is a lot of terrorism in the world where there are people who have no respect for the lives of innocent people.  Because I have not entirely understood what you said, I hope that this answer will be sufficient for you.

QUESTION:  During the first Chechen war the West did succeed in getting President Yeltsin to stop bombing the citizens of Grozny.  That hasn't happened this time.  I wanted to ask you why you thought that was true?  Why is Russia more self-isolating this time?  Is it the example, misused however it may be, of Kosovo?  Is it the coming elections or do you think the Russian military is less under the control of Russian politicians?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Well, first of all, it is very hard for me to give you a definitive or even speculative answer on this.  I do not accept the similarity between this and Kosovo.  What happened that Milosevic did was to have government-directed ethnic cleansing on a large scale and a wholly different approach to how this was being carried out.  So I don't accept that analogy.

I believe that from listening to Foreign Minister Ivanov, is that they basically see this as a threat to the territorial integrity and existence of the Russian Federation and that for them it is an important goal to be able to rid themselves of terrorists.  That is their explanation.  I think because they feel that they were not able to accomplish that earlier, they now can.

That does not mean that it is an explanation that the United States accepts or that the other members of the G-8 accepted this morning.  There is definitely the feeling among the rest of us, that while there may be legitimate problems with terrorists that there is no legitimate military solution to the Chechen conflict and that the only way to accomplish what the Russians legitimately want -- which is to keep their territorial integrity -- is through a political dialogue with those representatives of the rebel groups that can engage in such a dialogue, and that there needs to be the greatest care taken for the civilians who are caught in a terrible humanitarian debacle.

QUESTION: In that respect, Mr. Fischer stated that many of the G-8, I'm quoting him now, ""are demanding an immediate ceasefire.""  Do you support that demand?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT :  Yes, we are demanding an immediate and long-term ceasefire.  We are not looking for some short-term ceasefire that just would allow people to leave --  though we believe people ought to be allowed to leave --  but there needs to be a long-term ceasefire and a political dialogue.  Yes, we did agree.

The other thing that we did all agree on and were concerned about, was the spill-over on the rest of the region from the kind of fighting that is going on in Chechnya and [there was] discussion about the affect it might have on the neighboring countries, very great concern about that.

QUESTION: Beyond intense jawboning that we've heard in the last few days and weeks, isn't there anything that the West can do that would perhaps make the Russians hurt a little bit?  There is some talk about perhaps withholding EXIM Bank funds and other loans of that sort.

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: We are all very concerned, obviously, about the fact that this continues and that is why we have been proposing a ceasefire and the protection of the civilians and the importance of a political dialogue.  There were not specific discussions about taking any other actions beyond what the Chairman of the G-8 stated.   I think what is important here is that we are all united in making clear to the Russians that this is unacceptable.   It is creating for them a situation where they are being systematically excluded from the kinds of international dialogue that we have had with them for the last ten years. Whereas for the last ten years we have been trying to bring them into things that [now] they are isolating themselves and all of a sudden being outside and that this will have an effect.  I think there are number of actions that can be taken, but at this stage what we believe is important is to keep making the case to them that there should be a long-term ceasefire, that the civilians need to be protected and that the only way to reach an appropriate end is through a political dialogue.

QUESTION:  I understand you have been seeing members of the Serbian Opposition today.  Can you say anything about that meeting?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:   I will be seeing them later. I have met them before.  We all met in Istanbul and one of the things we established, there which we will be doing this afternoon, is to have a U.S.-EU-Yugoslav Opposition dialogue in order to try to strengthen the possibilities of democracy actually at some stage coming to Serbia.  We have all made very clear that our fight has not been with the Serb people. The problems are with Milosevic, an indicted war criminal. And that there are forces, within Serbia, democratic forces that should be allowed to come to power through free elections.  That is the purpose of the discussion is to really hear from them, what they are doing and to be supportive in terms of the desire of those of us who were part of the Kosovo war to help assure the victory and really make sure that the people of the Balkans and especially of the former Yugoslavia -- have an ability to live freely and choose people of their own choice.

Thank you very much.

Madeleine Albright,20010121,2/8/00 Albright interview on CNN,"







MR. SHAW:  Joining us now to discuss this latest Middle East peace setback and other issues is United States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.

Madame Secretary, if all parties don't exercise the ""maximum restraint"" that the State Department has called for, what do you foresee?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Well, first of all, I think that it's very important that we don't get involved here -- or they -- in a cycle of violence.  The peace process is one that obviously goes through ups and downs.  It is very difficult, and we have arrived at a stage where the parties themselves have to make some very fateful decisions.  The fact that it has taken this many years to get this all done is a sign of the very many difficult decisions that they have to make.  The fact that this all started -- the Hizballah, in fact, do not have a stake in peace.  This is one of the things that happens as you begin to have some success in the peace process, that those who do not have a stake in it try to take action.  We hope very much and are encouraging restraint.

I had a conversation the last couple of days several times with Foreign Minister Shara of Syria and urged them to do what they can to control the activities of the Hizballah, and hope very much that there is not an escalation.  There is a Monitoring Group that was set up in '96 in order to try to prevent escalation here.  That Monitoring Group we believe should be meeting and should deal with this in a way that it does not escalate further.

MS. WOODRUFF:  Madame Secretary, this is Judy Woodruff.  My question to you is:  Have the Israelis overreacted here?  There are those who are saying they have escalated; not only that, they're saying they're going to ignore this four-year-old agreement not to involve civilians.

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  First of all, let me do the last point first.  They have actually not said that they were going to ignore the agreement.  I believe that the reason that they took this step is that they have been taking casualties, and they want to make very clear to the Hizballah that they will not put up with taking casualties -- but they are not ignoring the '96 understandings.  The Monitoring Group needs to meet in order to deal with the problems.

MS. WOODRUFF:  So reports to the contrary are in error?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Yes.  I think that that is not a -- to my understanding, that is not a correct assessment of what the Israelis said.

MR. SHAW:  Barry Schweid,  the Associated Press' diplomatic correspondent has moved the story, saying that Lebanon's ambassador has accused the Israelis of targeting civilians, and the ambassador has called on the Clinton Administration to stop the Israeli attacks.

Your reaction?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  First of all, I think that as I said I think the Israelis have hit infrastructure and the power plants.  I don't think that they are going after civilians, but they did want to send a very strong signal.  A number of their military have died as a result of attacks by the Hizballah that have been launched out of villages, which is something that is not part of the understandings of '96.

MS. WOODRUFF:  Madame Secretary, the United States has clearly been deeply involved in the region.  President Clinton has made numerous phone calls since the latest round and even previous rounds of negotiations were underway.  Has he been involved in the last 48 hours making phone calls here?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  The President -- we have kept him fully informed in this.  I have been making a lot of the phone calls.  We all have.  The President is obviously very concerned.  He has invested a great deal of time in this and will continue to do so.

MR. SHAW:  At the beginning of this interview you underscored, in your words, the need to avoid getting into a cycle of violence.  In a word, without -- well, I'll just ask you.  Tell us where, exactly where, are the Syrians and the Israelis on a peace agreement and the Israelis and the Palestinians?  How close are they, Madame Secretary?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  As I said, they have decisions to make, all the parties on both the tracks.  The talks that we had on the Syrian track here, first at Blair House and at Shepherdstown, I think that the process was able to move forward.  As you remember from the time there had not been meetings of this high level in a number of years, and the fact that they were together and we were actually discussing the issues that are central to the Syrian track -- withdrawal, security, water, and the timing of all this -- I think was very important.

I think progress was made, but there is an awful lot left to do and we can expect to continue to try to move this process forward.  But as I said, they have to make the decisions.

On the Palestinian track, they've had a lot of ups and downs, back and forth.  They are still working out the interim agreements, the Sharm el Sheik agreement.  I believe that after some discussion and difficulties we'll get it back on track.  I have gotten, I have to say, kind of used to the ups and downs in this, and we are not the ones that can make the decisions.  They have to make the decisions, and the U.S. is always prepared to be as helpful as we can.

Ambassador Ross was in the region last week.  He's going back again, and we're just going to keep at it.  What we do not want is to have it be disrupted by a cycle of violence.

MS. WOODRUFF:  Madame Secretary, just one last very quick question about Chechnya.  You told the Senate today that you believe the war in Chechnya will go on even though the Russians have pretty much overrun the capital city of Grozny.  Are you saying that you think the rebels there still have considerable strength?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  I'm concerned about the fact, and this is what we have been telling the Russians, that while they may have control of Grozny, that the rebels have withdrawn to the south and the west into the mountains.  These are guerrilla fighters who I believe do have resources in order to keep coming back.  And, therefore, we have said -- I said it to Acting President Putin -- that we don't see a military solution to Chechnya; there has to be political dialogue and a way for ultimately the status of Chechnya to be resolved within the Russian Federation through political dialogue.

MS. WOODRUFF:  All right, Madame Secretary.  Madeleine Albright, Secretary of State for the United States, we thank you very much for joining us.

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Good to be with you Judy and Bernie.

MS. WOODRUFF:  Thank you.



MR. SHAW:  Thank you.

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Thanks.

[End CNN Interview.  Followed by press stakeout outside CNN studios.]

MR. RUBIN:  They have a few questions for you.

QUESTION:  What the Lebanese Ambassador said:  he said Israel is violating the '96 agreement in intentionally targeting civilians, and Hizballah is fighting fair.  He doesn't say they're not attacking soldiers, but they're not using civilians as cover.

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  First of all, I think as I stated, that basically what the Israelis have done is to send a very strong signal about the fact that they don't want this escalating.  The Hizballah is -- if one is talking about the '96 understandings -- they are launching some of their attacks out of villages.  That is not a part of the '96 understandings.

The Israelis, in contrast to what has been reported, have not said that they will not abide by the '96 understandings, and we believe that the Monitoring Group, which was set up in '96, needs to meet to deal with this so that there is not an escalation.

QUESTION:  They said the Israelis are hitting power stations.  You know, they say that they're hitting the civilian infrastructure -- I mean, the Ambassador says.

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Well, they are hitting power stations, and I think that they are sending a very strong signal.  They have, however, lost a number of their military and they want to make sure that the message is received.  There is no question about that.

But what we would like to avoid is an escalation here and a cycle of violence, and we think that the Monitoring Group needs to deal with this.  I have spoken to Foreign Minister Shara to see what the Syrians can do more to control the Hizballah.

QUESTION:  And what was their response?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Well, they basically say that they're doing what they can, but I think the problem here is that the Hizballah -- I mean, this is not so unlikely as we move towards progress and peace -- this happens in many places, that those extreme groups, terrorists who have no interest in peace, take their various actions.  It's up to those who can have some control over them to make it clear that this is not the way to solve the problem.

QUESTION:  The White House guidance, the prescription, their answer, was:  Go the Monitoring Group.  Is that what you're suggesting?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Well, that's what I'm saying:  it was set up to do this.  They have been able to defuse a number of situations that are not dissimilar, and these '96 understandings have worked.  What I would really like to see is not to have a cycle of violence; the Monitoring Group work; and for us to be able to continue the kind of preparing the ground on the Syrian track with the Israelis in order to be able to move the process forward.

QUESTION:  Is Ambassador Ross going back to work on this problem or to work the peace problem, or are they the same problem?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Well, he is a multifaceted negotiator.

QUESTION:  He used to do Russia, too.

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Well, he's not going to do that this time but he is tuned in to all parts of this problem, obviously, and will do what he can.

QUESTION:  When is he going?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Next week.

QUESTION:  Are the Syrians correct when they say that both you and Foreign Minister Shara are calling for this urgent, immediate meeting of the Monitoring Group?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Well, yes.  I mean, we are calling for it.  The Israelis I think have said that they also -- I don't have their exact words, but it's my understanding that the Monitoring Group --

QUESTION:  But it's not a joint call, is it?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Well, no.

QUESTION:  The US is calling for it?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Yes.

QUESTION:  You don't need Syria to --

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  No.

QUESTION:  -- hold your hand, join hands with you?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  No.

Madeleine Albright,20010407,2/2/00 Albright remarks following meeting with Min. Putin,"







SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: I have just had a 2 hour 45 minute meeting with Acting President Putin and we covered a lot of the most important issues in the U.S.-Russian relationship.  We talked about arms control, non-proliferation, the economy, civil society, Chechnya and regional conflict.  And as I said in the speech that I gave this morning, clearly there are areas of cooperation and areas in which we disagree.  And that was evident in our discussions.  What was interesting was that Acting President Putin did say that, for them, U.S.-Russian relations are of over-riding importance and I agreed with that.  And, so we had a very, I thought, a very substantive and very useful meeting.  And I'd be very glad to answer your questions.

QUESTION:  Thank you.  In your speech, you dwelled on the problem of proliferation and you said they'd made a good start with the new regime but that you needed more action. What you did mention, at least North Korea and Iran are specific areas of concern, did you take this up with him in specific terms, and did you get anything in the way of assurances that something they're doing, they will stop doing, and if so, what is it, please?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: Well, on proliferation we committed ourselves to work together on it and that he expressed agreement with the approach that we are taking and I talked about the need for strong enforcement of Russia's export controls.  And that a process we've established to deal with that will be carried on.  He did understand the importance of what was going on.  We talked about North Korea and Iran and problems created by them in a variety of places.

QUESTION:  Madam Secretary, one of the reasons that you came here was to try to build some new trust and confidence in the bilateral relationship.  You mentioned this morning that they were going -- U.S.-Russian relations -- were going through a kind of strange period.  Do you leave with a sense that the relationship is better than when you arrived?  And what actually did you accomplish on that broader front?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: Well, first of all I think that we did several things while I was here.  And I do think that the fact that we had successful multilateral track talks was actually not a foregone conclusion. I think that the fact that it worked and that we accomplished setting up the committees has a lot to do with the fact that we worked very closely with the Russians and as an example of one of the areas in which our cooperation serves us well.

I think, though, this visit and the number of times that I've met with Foreign Minister Ivanov, and in addition to this morning's meeting with Acting President Putin, I had a sense that we are very clear about the importance of the U.S.-Russian relationship, that we have a number of areas that we have [where] agreement must be worked on.  I was impressed with the kind of can-do approach that Acting President Putin put forward in terms of issues -- those issues that I discussed.  A certain amount of problem-solving approach.  I did not feel that we had dogmatic discussions.  We had practical discussions between leaders -- him, not me, (inaudible) leader -- of countries that know that they have an essential relationship and that we have to deal with problems.

Now, on the whole, the discussion was one in which it was a can-do approach.  We didn't mince words however, either of us, on the issue of Chechnya, where we clearly continue to have disagreements.  So Tyler, I think that basically to say -- from my perspective I think it was a good trip because we are able to have an event that showed the importance of acting together .  I had many discussions in which I was able to outline our approach to issues and hear theirs.  And I think it was a good way of having a longer meeting with Acting President Putin.  It's the third time I've met him.  I was with the President when he met him in Auckland and Oslo, but, obviously, having a chance to have an almost three-hour meeting with him gave me a chance to have a better sense of, what his interests were and how he might act.

QUESTION:  Thank you.  Two questions Madam Secretary.  I know that you were saying before you got here that you wanted to deliver the message that Russia was continuing to isolate itself with the war in Chechnya.  But what was President Putin's direct response to you, if in fact you delivered that exact message, and secondly you said you met with him for almost three hours.  Before you arrived you described him as having two strands to his personality.  Did you get a better sense about which direction he's going in?  Did he share anything with you that would help you to clarify your position or his position on it?

SECRETARY ALBIGHT: First, let me say, I did in fact say what I had said I was going to say: that they were isolating themselves.  I think that -- and I'm just telling you my sense of what his sense about this is -- that to them, what they're doing in Chechnya is essential for the future of Russia.  That is the way they see it.

They see themselves as fighting terrorists and those who would like to undermine Russia.  So for them, he feels this is essential.  And, I think that, basically, while he heard what I had to say on the isolation, self-isolation issue, I don't think that it was  it's not dispositive for him given their view of how they see this.  I obviously disagreed.

I also said to him what I've said publicly.  Which is that he's riding a tiger and that we do not see a military solution to this and that there had to be a political solution to it.  We -- either while he restated theirs and talked about what he considered terrorists were doing in Chechnya and the instability that it was posing for the region, I put a number of suggestions on the table.  And in response I had proposed that there be a humanitarian needs assessment team that could go into Chechnya; something that has not been possible since the beginning of the war.  And he seemed receptive to that idea and asked that Foreign Minister Ivanov and I discuss it further, which we obviously will.

I also said to him that there was a real problem in terms of people -- that we were operating off of different facts, somehow, and therefore, that it was necessary for him to let accredited journalists go in and for there to be greater transparency.  And he seemed to take that onboard.  And, we'll see.  But, you know as I said, neither of us minced words on Chechnya, but I did put some of these ideas forward. And he seemed, you know, at least was willing to talk about them.

I don't think that we're any closer to a solution -- political solution -- on Chechnya, but I was interested in his saying that he was for greater  for some kind of stable relationship, greater autonomy for Cechnya and social and economic reconstruction there.  But I didn't hear how he intended to get from here to there.  I found him a very well-informed person and a very good interlocutor.  He was obviously on top of all the issues that we talked about.  He's obviously a Russian patriot and also someone who seeks a normal position for Russia within the West.  And he struck me as a problem solver.

QUESTION:  I don't know if there's anything more you can tell us about his manner and his demeanor with you; your sense of him as a person.  And also I wanted to ask about the ABM thing.  In your speech you said we would urge the Russians not to just say ""Nyet"" to changes in the ABM and I wondered if that was also a restatement in positions.

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: Let me take it from the bottom.  I was encouraged by the discussion on arms control and some seeming flexibility on deep cuts.  He seemed to have a common, I don't know whether we'd have the common view, but an understanding of new threats and how to deal with them while preserving the fundamental principles of the ABM Treaty.  And we talked about the importance of getting START II ratified.  So, I found him knowledgeable on the subject and, again, encouraged by flexibility.  But on all of these issues and all the discussions I had I think  -- and this also has to do with the second part of your question, is whatever impression I might have is neither here nor there.  What is important is whether there are facts that actually happen.  And how he carries out the various things that he is proposing and the actions, I think, and while I think everybody has been engaged in psychobabble about him, I think that what is important now is to watch what he does.  And that's the judgement that we ought to make.

In terms of what he's like, we had a very intensive but pleasant discussion.  I mean, we both spoke very openly about what we thought and as I said he's a very interesting interlocutor and patient, I'd have to say.  I don't think he was planning to spend almost three hours.  And there are those who say that this is probably the longest meeting that a Secretary of State has had on a first meeting with a Russian leader.  You'll have to check history for that, however.

QUESTION:  Just one follow-on to that. Did he refer at all to notes, or did he simply speak extemporaneously.

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: He was actually quite funny about that.  He held up a stack of cards and said that those had been prepared for him, but he didn't use them.  He took notes.  I also showed my cards that had been prepared for me.  And so I think that in that regard, we had a fairly -- how these things go -- informal discussion.  I've been in a number of meetings with lots of different people all over the world, where sometimes you could just exchange your cards.  But, this was one of those where I think that we had a genuine discussion.

QUESTION:  You mentioned that he seemed to show some flexibility on numbers and deeper cuts.  Can you tell us whether you discussed START III and numbers below 2,500 or 2000?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: I never said that he was flexible on numbers.  I said that, overall, I was encouraged by his flexibility and that he did talk about deep cuts.  But we never talked about numbers or any details of START III.  But, we were talking about general aspects of how to move forward and obviously again these are negotiations that are going to be carried out  -- discussions and negotiations at other levels.  At Strobe Talbot (inaudible) , as well as Foreign Minister Ivanov and I are going to be. But we did not discuss any numbers, Jane.

QUESTION:  Madam Secretary, during your discussion with Vladimir Putin today did you, at any stage, hear any indication that he intends to open any negotiations with anyone in Chechnya?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: I think that, as I said, I didn't think they were closer to a political dialogue and he talked about the difficulty of finding an interlocutor.

QUESTION: Do you think that this conflict ends with the taking of Grozny, as the Russians seemed to suggest at different points?  And the second part of my question would be, did you have any discussion about a possible summit -- a Presidential summit?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: I have said that I think it's very difficult to see a military solution to this.  And I said that to him.  And the fact that the Chechen fighters are different kinds of fighters and it's a little hard to say that having occupied Grozny is how it would end.  And, basically, one of the reasons that we've been saying to them that we don't see a military solution is that it's hard to see it ending simply by that, by taking Grozny.  He and I did not discuss a summit, though it has been part of a discussion that I've had in a general way with Foreign Minister Ivanov.

QUESTION:  Did he make the familiar promise to push for START ratification that we've heard?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: I asked him and he said he would.  Yes.

Madeleine Albright,20010407,"3/26/00 Albright on CNN's ""Late Edition""","







QUESTION: First of all, give us please your assessment of Vladimir Putin.

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: Well, he's obviously a very complicated man who has several strands to his background but, as we see him now, he is being very pragmatic. He is dealing with Russia's problems and we are going to have to watch his actions very closely and carefully.

He is showing that he's interested in some serious economic reforms. He has been open to discussion about arms control and nonproliferation issues, which are of major importance to us, but we continue to be very concerned about the campaign in Chechnya. He speaks about it a lot in terms of the problems of terrorism, which obviously every country has to deal with, but we are concerned about the displaced people and some of the terrible humanitarian consequences of the Chechnya campaign.

QUESTION: Is it your sense, though, that this is a leader of Russia that the Clinton Administration, the United States Government, can work with?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: First of all, let me say that we work with leaders of various countries that have been selected by their people. That is the job of any government, and we will not only work with him but obviously work with other members of the Russian Government and then various other people throughout the system.

When I met with Vladimir Putin as Acting President, I found him pragmatic, smart, on top of his brief, somebody who is a Russian nationalist but someone I think that we can and must work with.

QUESTION: There has been a lot of attention focused on his KGB background, the fact that he was a KGB agent in Germany during the height of the Cold War. Is that an element that Americans and others in the West should be concerned about, that he was overly influenced perhaps by that KGB background?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: I said at one point that we have to kind of stop with the psychobabble about him. He clearly has a background with the KGB, but we have to watch his actions. The Russian people are calling for order. You're there now and you know that. They feel that they've been through a fairly chaotic situation. In my mind, the question is whether it's order with a small ""o"" or a capital ""O."" I think that we have to obviously watch his actions.

I am somewhat concerned about the fact that there has not been access by the press to Chechnya and some of the issues to do with the media. There are concerns, but I think that, on the whole, what we see here is a leader who wants to be able to organize Russia in such a way that Russia can play its designated role in the international system. We prefer to have a Russia that we can work with, that has a sense of responsibility about how the international system needs to operate and be stabilized.

QUESTION: The New York Times in an editorial today says that there is some question about his commitment to democracy, noting that he is ""ambivalent about press freedoms,"" something that you just raised in the course of your comments. And others here in Moscow are telling me they also wonder how committed Vladimir Putin is to democracy.

In your assessment, how committed is he?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: I think we're going to have to see. He certainly uses all the right vocabulary and talks about the importance of having the support of the people. I think it's a mistake to prejudge him. It looks as though he is going to win this election. It's historic that the Russians are having such an election, that there is a transfer of power in a democratic and constitutional way, that the people have gone to the polls, that they are expressing their views.

I think that it's very important for the United States to be realistic about Putin and about Russia, but I don't think we should prejudge him in the way that some of the comments are. I think we've just got to see what his actions are. His words are okay, but we have to watch his actions.

QUESTION: A lot of Russians say they like Vladimir Putin and that his popularity has increased in recent months because of the crackdown in Chechnya, what many outsiders here see as a brutal campaign, a devastating campaign with an abuse of human rights in Chechnya. How much of an impact does that policy, the Russian military policy in Chechnya -- and we've all seen those devastating pictures of what's been going on over there -- how much of an impact will that have on US-Russian relations?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: I think it will have an impact. I think the people that I've spoken with are concerned about the kinds of things that are happening in Chechnya. You know, I left the President's trip in India in order to come to Geneva to give a speech before the Human Rights Commission, and among the various things that I criticized throughout the world that we felt were not up to snuff in terms of human rights was certainly Chechnya. It is very much on our minds. We believe that there have been excesses.

We have called for the possibility of an international observer presence there. The International Red Cross, the Human Rights Commission and Mary Robinson should be able to go in. There should be investigations and transparency there. So, clearly, Americans are troubled. Europeans are troubled.

I think that while Mr. Putin and many of the Russian people agree with this campaign, we do not believe that there is a military solution to the problem of Chechnya. We hope very much that very quickly now after his election that there will be a political dialogue that will resolve the issues in Chechnya.

QUESTION: Many of Mr. Putin's associates here in Moscow -- I've been here over the past few days -- have raised questions about George W. Bush's statement that the United States, if he were President, would, if necessary, unilaterally abrogate the ABM Treaty, the Antiballistic Missile Treaty, in order to build a defense missile shield in the United States.

They say that would severely rupture US-Russian relations. What do you say about that?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: We believe that the ABM Treaty is central to the arms control regimes that we've had up until now, and we also think that it can be adjusted and amended in a way that if the President should make the decision to deploy the NMD, that the ABM Treaty could be adjusted in a way to make that possible. The ABM Treaty has been amended before, so abrogating it is not something that the Clinton Administration is favoring. What we're favoring is, if the President decides to deploy the NMD, to have an amendment and adjustment of the ABM to be able to suit that.

QUESTION: On an issue that many American officials see as a source of great concern, Russian cooperation with Iran in the development of Iran's nuclear reactors. How serious of a problem is this, and is this a step that could help Iran develop a nuclear bomb?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: We have been very concerned about the transfer of technology to Iran. Nuclear reactor -- the peaceful uses is something else. But we are very concerned generally about the transfer of technology, the proper export controls, and we have been having discussions with the Russians about transfer of technology. That has been a concern, and they have taken some steps which we believe are useful, but more steps are necessary. It has been an issue of concern for us.

QUESTION: And just ahead, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright discusses prospects for peace in the Middle East and more. Late Edition from Moscow will be right back.

(Break.)

QUESTION: -- Madeleine Albright, who joined us from Geneva, Switzerland.

Madame Secretary, on the situation in the Middle East, the two tracks that the Clinton Administration is pursuing in the peace process, one involving the Israelis and the Palestinians; the second -- you're in Geneva today with the President -- involving the Israelis and the Syrians. Which of these two tracks has a greater chance of success during the remaining months of the Clinton Administration?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: Well, I'm not going to make bets on that. We are doing everything we can to get a comprehensive peace. The President and I and others have invested a tremendous amount of time in this. Ambassador Ross has gone back and forth many times, as you know, to work on both tracks, and we also want the track on Lebanon to work. We have been working on a comprehensive peace, and the talks on the Palestinian track at expert level are going on now outside of Washington. We are here in Geneva today because President Clinton believes that it's important to meet with President Assad to assess needs and policies.

We've been talking to Prime Minister Barak many, many times, and so now we've been trying to get the parties to bring their positions closer together on the Israeli-Syrian track, and we will continue to do that. We're going to try, as we can, on all tracks. But as you know, Wolf, it's very hard. The people themselves have to make the decision. We can facilitate and we can ask questions and we can try to make assessments, but the parties themselves have to make the hard decisions.

The President, in a conversation yesterday, said on the Syrian track that, ""The distance is short but the walk is hard.""

QUESTION: When you say ""the walk is hard,"" I was in Geneva in 1994 covering President Clinton's meeting then with President Assad. And as you will remember, there was great disappointment that President Assad at that time did not utter the words that many Administration officials had hoped he would utter. Has there been a shift, a serious substantive shift in Syria's attitude towards peace with Israel, that you think could result in the kind of breakthrough that you've been pushing for?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: Well, again, I don't want -- I think we have to be realistic about this. These two countries have been at odds for a very long time. On the other hand, the Syrians did come to the talks at Blair House and Shepherdstown. In my conversations with President Assad, he has indicated that he would like to find a solution -- and so has Prime Minister Barak. And so what we're doing is trying to see how we can be helpful in bringing them together and trying to reduce the distance between them.

But again, one thing that I've learned, Wolf, is not to predict success on any of these talks. They're very difficult. Each has its own dynamic. The President is putting a lot of effort into this, but there's no guarantees here. And all we can do is really try and see what the attitudes and needs and positions are, which is why the President is meeting with President Assad.

QUESTION: Madame Secretary, another issue that is of great concern to many Americans, namely the price of gasoline. As you know the, OPEC oil ministers are meeting in Vienna tomorrow to discuss whether to increase production, which presumably would result in a decrease in the price of a gallon of gasoline in the United States and elsewhere around the world.

Many Republicans have criticized the Clinton Administration's policy of, in effect they say, begging these oil ministers, friendly oil states, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, to go ahead and increase production. Is it unseemly? Is their criticism justified?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: Definitely it is not justified. I mean, what we've been doing is consulting with the producing countries in order to try to get a way for them to make a decision to stabilize prices that would be suitable for consumers as well as the producers. I think this is the way things are done and they obviously make their own decisions, but it's important to get those prices stabilized.

QUESTION: Do you think they will be stabilized as a result of the OPEC meeting in Vienna?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: Always hopeful, but it's hard to tell. Again, they have their meeting tomorrow. We'll see how it comes out.

QUESTION: All right, and we'll all be watching. Madame Secretary, thanks so much for taking some time from your busy schedule. Good luck in your peace efforts in Geneva and beyond.

Madeleine Albright,20010407,"11/22/99 Albright interview on STV, Bratislava, Slovakia","







[Note:  The interview was conducted in Slovak and Czech]

QUESTION:  Dear Madam Secretary, according to your statement and also according to the statement by President Clinton, Slovakia has made a great deal of progress on its road towards democracy, particularly in the political realm.  But as you have said in your lecture at the Comenius University today, there are still many people here who have problems to survive.  People who have difficulties to make ends meet on their salaries.  In your view, is this caused by objective reasons or are there also any specific subjective errors made by the current government which have caused that.  In terms of economy Slovakia still lags very much behind its political and democratic reforms.

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  First of all, I have to say that things are completely different here in Bratislava, in Slovakia now.  One has to look at what's going on now.  I think that the Slovaks can congratulate themselves on everything that has happened here since the 1998 elections.  Because with the change in the government, changes have also started to be noted in the way people perceive economic reform, what people think about their position in the world, how you're getting ready to become part of Europe.  So, in my view, a lot has happened indeed.  There is a problem, however, in that years have been wasted as you were not an integral part of the development in central Europe.  And now there is a lot of work to be done to make up for these losses.  But I think this government and the Parliament and all the others are working together to make something really important happen so that the economic reforms really help people.  The problem is that some of the decisions are tough and at the beginning it is more difficult for people than what will happen later.  The truth is, however, that such important decisions have to be taken so that it all works well in the end.  I think that Slovakia is on the right track now.

QUESTION:  In the past, Slovakia was often criticized for its approach to the rights of national minorities.  Much has improved in that respect.  The members of the Hungarian minority are also represented in the government and in the (presaedium) of the Parliament.  But the problem which has currently emerged is that of the Roma minority.  Does the United States have any proposal, does the United States see any possibility of how to resolve this problem in an effective manner, be it within Slovakia or in the framework of  the whole central Europe.

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  In the first place, these problems are not only found in Slovakia.  They are present everywhere in Europe and there are problems with minorities everywhere.  But the problem with the Roma indeed is a problem and we discussed it with Prime Minister Dzurinda when he visited America, when he was in New York and also in Washington.  And we reflected upon this issue.   Because it is not only a Slovak problem, and we have to talk about it.  When we were in Istanbul now, it is mentioned in the OSCE charter that more has to be done for the Roma.  And I think that this is an issue where the Slovaks really have made significant progress when they have done something for the Hungarian minority through the law on minority languages.  I think it is very important that something be done everywhere.  The Czechs are having tremendous problems with the Roma.  We know that the Hungarians, the Romanians, and Bulgarians are as well.  So it is not only here and all these things have to be done together.

QUESTION:  The principal foreign policy objective of the Slovak Republic is integration in the European Union, NATO and the OECD.  As regards the European Union, we are now expecting a positive signal to be sent out by the Helsinki summit of the European Union.  But our citizens are certainly also interested in other dates.  Could you give us a (inaudible) as to when Slovakia could become a member of the OECD and NATO?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  In the first place, we hope that Helsinki will bring about steps that will lead to your membership in the European Union.  It is very important and we have seen that to receive a positive report concerning your economic reforms, it's very good, it's very important and we support it.  We also support your entry into the OECD because that means you will be able to be part of the economic world where things happen and that is very important.  Now the situation with NATO is as follows.  You are now a part of the Partnership for Peace, which is very important.  You already cooperate with NATO in Bosnia, Kosovo, Albania and in Slavonia so all this is very important so you really are our partners.  So the decision taken in Washington in spring this year that by the year 2002 at the latest, a decision must be taken on who will be the next parties to join NATO.  At the moment a plan is being worked out.  It is called the Membership Action Plan according to which any nation which wants to join NATO has to look at how to proceed.  It is kind of a road map.  So we cooperate with you in order to show you what has to be done and how things should be broken down in the budget, what things have to be done for the Army so that it will become ready to work together with NATO because the I think, and I said that to the students this morning, one has to view NATO as the biggest alliance, the most important one in the world, both the military and the political one.  So the countries really have to be ready to join it because otherwise NATO would not be NATO because it would be weaker.  What must happen is that any nation which joins NATO must contribute rather than take away.  So now you have time to prepare, we shall work together with you.  People will arrive here, and not only from America, but also from other NATO countries to help you.

QUESTION:  With respect to integration into NATO and particularly in regard to the Kosovo conflict and the NATO campaign, the public opinion of the citizens of the Slovak Republic regarding integration of Slovakia into NATO has dropped considerably.  What argument would you use to convince those people who do not wish Slovakia to join NATO?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  First of all it's very important to understand what has actually happened in Kosovo.  When I was a child, my father was the Czechoslovak Ambassador to Yugoslavia.  So I started my life as a small girl together with my father there and we loved the Serbs.  They were a wonderful nation.  They behaved wonderfully during World War II.  I then studied under Communism and I know very well how Yugoslavia spoke about Communism -- that it should be overcome -- and I know that many Czechs and Slovaks and Poles really loved Yugoslavia and the Serbs.  But the Serbs who were committing the atrocities in Kosovo and before that in Bosnia, are not the ones that we once loved.  These are people who were told by Milosevic what to do and Milosevic is nothing but an ordinary dictator.  Milosevic is an awful man who thinks about nothing else than what he wants.  So what we had to do as NATO was to end that terrible ethnic cleansing which was happening there and I think we have stopped it and therefore I hope the Slovaks will understand what has happened there.   And that NATO works to prevent such horrible things from happening.  And for me, I think, it's very important to be in NATO because it is something like a link which shows how people view the world and political values.

QUESTION:  In regard to the NATO enlargement, the position of Russia is very important and as it is generally known, Russia is categorically opposed to the NATO enlargement.  In your lecture at the university today, you have also said that Russia has no right to veto NATO enlargement.  In spite of that, the role of Russia is important enough not to be overlooked.  So don't you happen to see any potential threat or risks that may bring the international situation to a head or ones that might lead to the emergence of new tensions in the case of further NATO enlargement to the east?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  I don't think so, because we shall continue to point out that NATO is not against Russia.  And once there is a new Russia, and this is what they insist that they are building -- a new Russia, then the new Russia does not have to be afraid of the new NATO.  And I think that we want to cooperate.  I mean there is an organization which brings us together.  We meet them there since the talks about stability started and as I said in my lecture, the Russians do not like it but I think it will be important in the years to come to show that this is not meant to be against Russia.  And if I may refer back to Kosovo and Bosnia, the Russian army is there with us.  They work together with us in Bosnia and Kosovo.  We are working there together.  So in the long run, we envisage the possibility of cooperation between NATO and Russia and things may really evolve in such a way that people who do not have to be afraid that Russia would be angry.  I think that after all this is better for the stability of central and southern Europe.  I think that we can achieve understanding with Russia.

QUESTION:  Another problem which threatens stability in the region, specifically the Caucasus, is the current conflict in Chechnya.  Russia insists that it is an internal matter of Russia.  The United States and the international community are of a different opinion.  What steps can the United States and the international community take in your view to, on the one hand, convince Russia that this is not a mere internal conflict of Russia, because it is a matter of human rights, and what possibilities are there for the international community to mediate or to restore peace in Chechnya?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:   In the first place, when we speak with Russians about what is going on in Chechnya they refer to these events as their fight against terrorists.  They say that tough action must be taken against these terrorists and this is exactly what Mr. Yeltsin has said in Istanbul.  The truth is that we all have problems with terrorists.  But we are concerned with how the Russians pursue this matter now.  They are committing atrocious things against the civilians.  So we are quite worried about humanitarian conditions there.  Mrs. Ogata, of the United Nations, who has recently visited the area, has said that the conditions for the people there are just horrible and that people are fleeing Chechnya.  And when we were in Istanbul there were 54 OSCE-member nations attending the event and 53 of them had something negative to say about how the Russians pursue their campaign with the use of their army.  The best method of how to resolve this issue is through political means.  So there must be some kind of political development in order to bring this to an end.

What has been decided there is that the Chairman of the OSCE, at present it is the Norwegian representative, Mr. Knut Vollebaek, will have to go there and try to find a political solution, a political outcome to this situation.  So we hope this will take place soon because what we hear is not good.  And what we think in particular is that the Russians are pursuing a wrong avenue because when they had the war two or three years ago they lost it because there were terrible things happening there in those days.  After all they cannot go on for years and years being embroiled in conflicts of this nature because they will end up being shot at by different guerillas and they would become dragged into the war even further.  So the best possible solution is some kind of a political settlement.

QUESTION:  Some of the American media, even of the TV station CNN, have presented some speculations to the effect that allegedly a quiet diplomatic agreement exists between Washington and Moscow in that if Moscow shows more understanding and tolerance towards the United States campaign against Iraq, against Saddam Hussein, then the United States might have a more tolerant view of how Russia is tackling the problems in Chechnya.  Is there any justification for these kinds of speculations?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  No there isn't.  Because in the first place it would not come to that at all.  Because we are of the opinion that this is a completely different matter, as can be seen today, Saddam Hussein has said himself they are not going to sell more petroleum and this is a very cynical attitude on his part because in this way it is evident that Saddam Hussein simply prevents his people from having enough food and medicine.  The only thing we want is for them to give up, to relinquish those horrible weapons of mass destruction.  So those speculations that you refer to are unfounded.

QUESTION:  In conclusion Madam Secretary, permit me to come back once again to the relations between the United States and Slovakia.  The American Congress has recently adopted a resolution which has made a very positive assessment of the development in Slovakia.  I'm interested to know what is the specific significance of this resolution?  What is being opened now for Slovakia?  How would relations between the U.S. and Slovakia evolve as a result of this resolution?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Well, first of all, I think that everything indicates that our ties with the new democratic Slovakia are becoming ever closer.  I think that the resolution was meant to demonstrate that we indeed support the current development in Slovakia, the economic reforms, the work performed by the government, led by Mr. Dzurinda, and we all cooperate and we keep in mind that Slovakia should become an integral part of Europe.  And such a resolution is a very clear indication of the fact that there are many members in the Congress who support Slovakia which is important, but the work which has to be done for Slovakia to join NATO, as I have described it already, I think that this will need some more work.  But this is a very clear manifestation of the English word, ""goodwill,"" goodwill toward Slovakia and that's very important.  And that is something that you have got to build upon because such goodwill will not remain if nothing happens, if there is no action.  The truth is that the momentum which has been there since this new government started its current work has to be taken even further.  It is not easy.  We all know it is not easy, but it is necessary to continue to work in order to keep the goodwill alive.

QUESTION:  Madam Secretary, thank you for this interview.

Madeleine Albright,20010407,10/26/99 Albright and Minister Van Aartsen remarks,"







SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Good afternoon.  It is a pleasure to welcome Foreign Minister van Aartsen to Washington today.  America's friendship with the Dutch dates back to the American Revolution.  The ties between our peoples began even earlier when Puritans took refuge in the Netherlands before coming to our shores.

Today, the Netherlands is one of America's most important partners in trade and investment.  It is a NATO ally and a firm friend of democracy and peace in Europe and around the world.

Just last week I had the pleasure of seeing our partnership in action when I reviewed, with a Dutch colleague, a battalion of peacekeeping soldiers from Mali.  The United States provided their training and the Netherlands will fund their deployment to Sierra Leone -- an excellent example of how we can work together to accomplish goals neither could do alone.

Today, the Foreign Minister and I discussed a number of issues facing our NATO alliance including European efforts to develop a separate European defense identity.  The United States welcomes European efforts to develop a common security and defense policy, and to enhance Europe's capability to perform NATO and EU missions.  We ask, and I believe our Dutch partners agree, that such a process be effective and efficient, and that it serve to strengthen the trans-Atlantic link.

We also reviewed progress in the Balkans, where the Netherlands played a key role in ending the fighting and is now a central part of efforts to bring lasting peace.  I thanked the Foreign Minister for his country's generous contributions to the Balkan reconstructions.

We discussed the ominous developments in Chechnya.  Both our nations are deeply concerned by the escalating violence and mounting civilian casualties.  We urge Russia not to repeat the mistakes of the past in Chechnya, and instead to open a dialogue toward a peaceful resolution with legitimate Chechen partners.

The United States and the Netherlands are also close partners on the UN Security Council, where the Dutch are serving a two-year term and doing an outstanding job as chair of the Iraq sanctions committee.  This morning, the Foreign Minister and I discussed the situation in the Persian Gulf, and the next steps we must take to ensure that Saddam Hussein does not again threaten his neighbors in the region.

And, finally, I took the opportunity during the meeting to thank the Foreign Minister for his country's strong support of the UN Mission to East Timor, and the forthcoming UN presence in Sierra Leone.

So in Kosovo or New York, or Africa or NATO, our two nations have a proven record of partnership that serves our interests and promotes our ideals.  And I look forward to working very closely, as we have been, with the Foreign Minister to extend that record, and build our friendship, during the remaining days of this century and into the next.

Foreign Minister.

FOREIGN MINISTER VAN AARTSEN:  Madame Secretary, thank you very much for your kind words.  Today we had a very constructive discussion on several topics.  You mentioned them already.  I completely agree about what you said about Chechnya because a warning towards Russia is necessary, I think, in this respect.

And every time, again, it strikes me how our two nations share the same principles and the same values which are deeply rooted in our societies, and how close in fact both our visions are in world events.

We have discussed the wish of the countries of the European Union to strengthen its common foreign policy by developing a defense and security policy.  The Netherlands Government strongly believes that the development of a European security and defense policy should be fully compatible with NATO.  Full transparency between the EU and NATO is vital; therefore, the Netherlands Government proposes to set up a consultative, or consultative arrangements, between the EU and NATO and to secure the involvement of those NATO members that do not belong to the EU, such as Turkey and Norway.

On Iraq, we confirmed our shared commitments to end the suffering of the Iraqi people, to reach consensus on the current outstanding issues, unconditional implementation of the UN Security Council resolutions on Iraq, and establishing an effective monitoring system.  The Netherlands will work closely together with the other Security Council members to this goal and the Netherlands Government introduced  together with the UK  a draft resolution which has been supported by 11 members of the Security Council up until now.

Secretary of State stressed once again the continued support of the Administration for the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and its entry into force.  In talks I had yesterday with members of Congress I stressed how crucial this treaty is for global nonproliferation and for a safer world.

Thank you.

QUESTION:  Madame Secretary, one of the areas of the world you haven't touched on is India-Pakistan, where India says it has repulsed a Pakistani offensive.  Evidently, four Pakistani soldiers were killed.  It looks like a Kashmir flare-up again, despite assurances on both sides lately.  Could you validate or substantiate there is a problem there, and if you have something to say about it?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  First of all, let me say that Mr. Musharaff when he made his statement had said that he would withdraw forces from the international border and, as far as we know, he has done that.  This, unfortunately, is the time of year when there have been incidents on the line of control and what we would hope very much is that both sides do whatever they can to reduce tensions, and we have made that quite clear.

Obviously, I have not had a detailed report in terms of being able to verify for you the specifics of what you asked, but I think that the point here is that he did say he was going to withdraw them from the international border.  We would also like it done on the line of control.  But the issue, as I've said, this is the time of year, unfortunately, where these kinds of incidents do happen.

QUESTION:  Madame Secretary, the Dutch Government later this week sent an official trade delegation to Cuba headed by the Dutch trade minister.  Did you discuss this topic with Mr. van Aartsen and what do you make of this decision which is not in line, not at all in line, with US policy towards Cuba?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Actually, we didn't have a chance to talk about it, but I must say the following thing, that we believe that it is very important if anyone goes to always make sure that human rights issues are raised and that there is a chance for visits with as many of the dissidents as possible.

We also, in our discussions with Europeans, have always made clear that it is important for there to be support for a transition to democracy and non-investment in any of the expropriated properties.  That is something that we feel very strongly about.

We, ourselves, have been trying very hard to put in a set of measures that would allow there to be space for the Cuban people because the embargo is actually Castro's embargo against the Cuban people.

QUESTION:  So the US doesn't send official trade delegations?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Excuse me?

QUESTION:  The US does not send official trade delegations?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  No, we do not.  But we have ways that we let humanitarian missions or people go in in order to try to make clear our support for human rights.  We believe that it is important if anyone goes -- we obviously prefer that people don't go on trade missions-- but that it be very clear that there is support for democratization and the human rights agenda and that there not be any investment in expropriated properties.

QUESTION:  Yes, Madame Secretary, the Russian officials had some very strong words yesterday on the consequences of proceeding with the National Missile Defense.  I wondered how concerned you are that the whole of the arms control regime is in danger of collapsing?  And do you have any response to what the Russians said on that?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  First of all, I do not think that the whole arms control agenda is in danger of collapsing.  I think, as the Foreign Minister said, the United States has made very clear  the President has made very clear  that we would abide by the moratorium on testing that the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty would bring about, and that we will continue to have a full discussion of the value of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, not only to the United States but to the world, and that we would continue to press aggressively for an arms control agenda.

I must say, though, that I was troubled by the reports today of some statements by the Russian military that I think are an overreaction to our desire to deal with what we believe is a common problem, which is the threat that comes to all our countries from rogue states acquiring weapons of mass destruction and that we have a joint interest  we and the Russians and others  in dealing with that problem.  So I don't want us to -- anybody, whether here or in Russia -- to be reviving old problems.  We should be trying to solve new problems.

QUESTION:  Mr. van Aartsen, you just mentioned the enormous agreement between the United States and the Netherlands on matters of foreign policy.  Now Secretary Albright just showed that on Cuba there is a serious difference of opinion in the approach to Cuba.  Is that a matter of difference of opinion that you just agree to disagree upon or are you still trying to work it out?

FOREIGN MINISTER VAN AARTSEN:  As the Secretary of State has said, we haven't discussed it during our meeting and I don't think there is a serious difference of opinion here.  As the Secretary of State said, it is important when these sort of missions are going to Cuba, that they have a strong human rights element in it.  And as you know, the human rights element of the visit of Mr. Ybema has been strengthened over the last days.

QUESTION:  Madame Secretary, in your meetings tomorrow with Romano Prodi of the EU, I'm wondering what you think the major issues will be.  And also, Mr. Foreign Minister, if you could comment on what US-EU issues you think are important to be discussed.

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  First of all, I think the President is looking forward very much to his meeting with Mr. Prodi.  They have developed a very good relationship previously when Mr. Prodi was prime minister and they  we also believe that there are a whole host of issues to be discussed with the EU.  Some of them will obviously have to do with trade issues; some will have to do with the Balkans and our policies.  I'm sure they will also talk about Chechnya.

I think there will be the full scope of issues and I know from talking with the President that he's looking forward to it.  I have had discussions with Mr. Prodi myself and I think that we are very encouraged by what he has done in terms of putting together a new commission and really working very hard in terms of how he sees the European agenda.

FOREIGN MINISTER VAN AARTSEN:   Well, I think the Secretary of State gave the whole agenda away.  (Laughter).

QUESTION:  Madame Secretary, it sounds very much like the Egyptians are taking a pass on the meeting in Oslo.  If that's true, what do you make of it?  Are you surprised by it?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  First of all, I'm not sure that all the decisions have been made on the attendance at Oslo.  I know that it's a meeting where  the purpose of which is really to honor Prime Minister Rabin and everything that he did to move forward the peace process.  We hope very much that the meetings there again will enable us to continue to push on what is vital to the region and to the United States, which is a continuation of the peace process.  I don't want to make a judgment about something that I haven't heard definitively one way or the other.

Thank you.

Madeleine Albright,20010407,"1/2/2000: Albright on NBC's ""Meet The Press""","







Do you believe that Boris Yeltsin resigning, accepting immunity from criminal prosecution, setting the election date in Russia in March rather than June is undemocratic?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: No. I think that, actually, what has happened is they have done this transfer of power in a democratic, transparent way. We have to remember the great role that President Yeltsin played. I mean, he was the first democratically elected president of Russia. He has abided by a variety of democratic principles and I think that this transfer of power to an acting president is something that we believe has taken place democratically, moving the elections up or things that happen in other societies.

I think what is very important here though is that the democratic aspects of what Yeltsin has done need to be continued. We were quite encouraged by a speech that Acting President Putin made in the last 48 hours in which he talked about the importance of freedom of expression, of association, of press and his dedication to a rule of law. We are going to be watching, obviously, very carefully.

There are kind of two strands, I think, to Acting President Putin. You described the KGB part and Mr. Yakushin did. But also we have to remember that he has been a prime reformer. He was deputy mayor in St. Petersburg under Sobchak and took a lot of steps that indicated his interest in economic reform and we are going to be looking for actions in terms of economic reform and perpetuation of the rule of law.

MR. RUSSERT: His first official visit, as I mentioned, was to Chechnya, giving hunting knives to the Russian military. His popularity in Russia is based largely on his execution of the war in Chechnya. Aren't you concerned about that?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: Well, he's riding a tiger in this. I think there is no question. I mean, he has based a great deal of his style on what is happening in Chechnya and the fact that he went there. But I think we believe that there is a very dangerous aspect to this in terms of quagmire and that he needs to develop some kind of an exit strategy.

We have argued for a long time that the only solution to Chechnya -- and one can't say that the Russians don't have a problem in Chechnya; they clearly do. But that there can only be a political solution to this. There have been some negotiations with a variety of Chechen leaders. We have urged them, as have other European allies, to find a political solution. That is the only way they are going to make this work.

MR. RUSSERT: Do you think the Russian Government has committed atrocities in Chechnya?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: I think what has happened is they have, in fact, taken wanton action against the civilians. We understand that they do have a problem with terrorists and I think that if we had had three apartment buildings blown up in Washington as they did in Moscow, and they do have concerns about terrorists. But what we have criticized them for, as have the Europeans, is action against innocent civilians who have been pushed out of Chechnya and really a lot of them have obviously died.

MR. RUSSERT: Why were we so surprised by Yeltsin's resignation? We never got a heads-up.

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: Well, there were lots of rumors about it and there have been for a long time. But, as Mr. Yakushin said, the Russians themselves were surprised. I think that Yeltsin has always been a man of the bold move and seizing the historic moment. But obviously there have been rumors for some time about it but everybody was surprised, as they've said.

MR. RUSSERT: The fact that Putin is a KGB agent, former, 16 years, uses words like ""dark-skinned people must be annihilated, find them in the latrine and kill them."" How tough of a person is he?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: Well, I also do not know those quotes. But let me just say this: He is a tough person. I have met him with the President. He is somebody that is very determined, action-oriented. I think we are going to have to watch his actions very carefully. But, as I said, there are these kind of two strands to him and I think that actions we will be watching. We believe that it is very important to have this productive relationship with the Russians.

I have spoken to Foreign Minister Ivanov so many times in the last weeks and, basically, we talk about the importance of cooperating on a number of issues that we agree on, we disagree on others. But I think we have got to be really careful here, Tim, not to recreate an enemy. You asked Yakushin about a cold war. We are not expecting that. We have a lot of issues that we have to work in common. The arms control agenda is a huge one.

Nonproliferation is a major issue for us in the 21st century and the Russians need to be a part of that, they need to ratify START II, we need to move on to START III, where there would be reductions. We need to deal with this issue of NMD and the ABM. So we have a large agenda with them and we are going to be working it.

MR. RUSSERT: You just heard any modification of the ABM in order for us to build a missile defense system apparently is not something the Russians are going to go along with.

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: Well, at this stage, they are not eager about that. But we have negotiations going on. My deputy, Strobe Talbott, has been very much involved in that. He will continue to be. I will be. We believe also in the centrality of the ABM treaty.

But we also are looking at new threats and the NMD system is not directed against Russia; it doesn't threaten them. We are concerned about the threats from states that are acquiring weapons of mass destruction.

MR. RUSSERT: We will build it, the missile defense system, with or without Russia's approval?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: Well, the decision hasn't been made. The decision to deploy is something that the President would be making later in the summer. But that decision has not been made. It will be based on whether it works and whether it suits our security needs and whether it is useful to the United States in dealing with the threat.

MR. RUSSERT: Are you comfortable with Vladimir Putin being in charge of Russia's nuclear arsenal?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: I think that he is a competent man and we believe that Russia is running according to a rational system. There are lots of people in the government that we work with and our experience with Acting President Putin so far has been good. But, again, actions are very important and I don't want to recreate an enemy here. I think it is very important.

MR. RUSSERT: Will President Clinton go to Russia to meet with him?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: I think that has not been determined but they have spoken on the telephone and we are all in contact all the time.

MR. RUSSERT: We have to take a quick break. We will come back and talk more on the world's hot spots. And then our political roundtable about Iowa and New Hampshire, Millennium resolutions, a lot more coming up right here on Meet the Press.

(Commercial break.)

MR. RUSSERT: And we're back.

Joining me in the questioning this morning, NBC's Andrea Mitchell.

MS. MITCHELL: Thank you. Good morning. Happy new year, Madame Secretary.

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: Happy new year to you.

MS. MITCHELL: You talked about freedom of expression in Russia. Why are we ignoring the fact in China that China has been rounding up tens of thousands of people because of their religious beliefs?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: We are not ignoring it; we have made many statements about it and continue to say that we cannot have a completely normal relationship with them so long as they have this kind of very bad human rights record and have made very clear that what they are doing with the Falun Gong and other religious leaders and people of conscience is unacceptable.

MS. MITCHELL: But we don't punish them. We don't link trade or economic policies to their human rights abuses. Yet while we continue trading with China, we continue the embargo against Cuba. Why do we continue that embargo when we treat China in this very different fashion?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: Well, first of all, I think it is very important, at the dawn of the 21st century, to understand the importance that China has played and will continue to play as the most populous nation and with huge and important power in Asia. We have a complex relationship with them; we will continue to do that.

We believe it is very important for us to have trading relations with them. Bringing them into the WTO, I think, has been a major accomplishment of the Clinton Administration in this last year. And also dealing with them on issues of proliferation, where their record has, I think, been improving and is very important to us. And, therefore, we have that kind of a relationship with them.

Cuba, the law of the land is an embargo. We believe that it is very important to try to expand the space for the people of Cuba to be able to have some freedom away from the government. That is why we have taken a whole set of measures to try to make sure that more people can travel to Cuba from the United States for humanitarian reasons, that they are able -- more people can send remittances. They are different countries in terms of Cuba being 90 miles off our shore and that the embargo is the law of the land.

But the China issue is so important because they are the growing power of the 21st century and it is essential for us to engage with them on a multitude of levels, not forgetting our own principles.

MS. MITCHELL: One of the big irritants right now between Cuba and the United States is the fate of a six-year-old boy, Elian Gonzalez. When I was in Cuba recently, Fidel Castro told me that he thought Bill Clinton really wants to return this child but is hampered, for the moment at least, by the politics of Florida. Is that the case?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: No. I think that what is happening here is the Immigration, the INS service, is the one that is making the determination and they are in the process of dealing with what is obviously a very hard decision. This child cannot be made a political football and that is where President Clinton, as we all, are.

MS. MITCHELL: If the father can prove that he is the proper parent, the custodial parent, and since our laws do say that biology should -- the biological parent should have the child if he can prove that he is the proper parent -- and, by all accounts down there and by our interviews with him he is -- then should the child be returned if the immigration officials believe that he should be returned?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: I think that we are waiting for a decision from the immigration people and the question is who speaks for the child. That is what they are looking at and this is a decision that INS is making.

MS. MITCHELL: But if they make that decision, that the father should speak for the child, do you believe that the child should go back to Cuba?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: I am not going to state what my personal views on the subject are. But the INS is making the determination and we will do what -- the way they come out on this.

MS. MITCHELL: And do you think that decision will be made soon or will this be allowed to drag on endlessly?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: I have a sense that this decision will be made within the near future. Nobody wants us to drag on. It is clearly a very difficult issue and the child -- I think we do all have to think about the child and that he can't become a political football.

MS. MITCHELL: You are going to be involved in very crucial talks tomorrow on the Middle East. Israel, Syria, a lot at stake. The President has been quoted telling associates that he believes there could be a comprehensive agreement between Israel and Syria in 90 days. Is that really possible?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: First of all, I think we've got to see what's happening tomorrow in context. It really is a remarkable time. For 50 years, we have been dealing with how Israel is recognized within its region. We've had peace with Egypt since the '70s and then with Jordan. And now having an agreement with Syria would really put a very important -- place another keystone or the keystone, I think, in many ways, into this thing as we are dealing also with the Palestinian issue, which is at the core. So this is a very big deal.

But we are all going into this with open eyes. I mean, this is a huge historic opportunity. Talks of this level have never taken place between Syria and Israel. But because there are so many fateful decisions involved in it, I think it will be a very difficult set of negotiations and we are all hopeful and basically Prime Minister Barak would like to see this move. So would the President. But we are not really putting a time frame on it.

MS. MITCHELL: Very briefly, do you think that if you have an agreement that Barak can sell it and have it approved by a referendum, especially with water rights and things like that, that are so crucial?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: I think water rights are clearly an important part. And what this agreement is going to be about are the areas of withdrawal of security, of what the peace looks like, you know, what is the character of it and the time table and water rights. Those are the issues that we are going to be talking about. They are bringing their experts to talk about all of that.

I think that Prime Minister Barak knows what he can do. He clearly has said that he has to sell this at a referendum and I think that he is going to be looking at how to do this. This is why these issues are so difficult: The leaders themselves have to make the decisions. The US can be a facilitator. I am going to be there the whole time in Shepherdstown, the President will be coming in as often as necessary. He will be deeply, deeply involved in this and we hope to be able to take advantage of this historic opportunity.

MR. RUSSERT: You sound reasonably optimistic.

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: I am neither optimistic nor pessimistic. I am clearly very much seized with the idea that we are doing something this historic, that the opportunity is there and that these two -- that President Assad and Prime Minister Barak are prepared to make the fateful decisions. But, Tim, they are very, very hard decisions and therefore I am prepared to roll up my sleeves and work with them and they are, more importantly, prepared to roll up their sleeves and really work on the issues.

I think we have to be very realistic. We don't know how long it is going to take. I think that we will assess where we are at the end of the week and we are just going to keep working it. It is too important not to give it our full attention.

MR. RUSSERT: Another difficult area, Iraq. One year ago, the inspectors were told, ""Get out,"" by Saddam Hussein. Do you believe that Saddam Hussein has more weapons of mass destruction now than he did a year ago?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: Well, we are very obviously concerned about his ability to reconstitute and we are keeping him in his box and the no-fly zones are being monitored and, as you know, we occasionally have to take military action as our planes are illuminated or our pilots are in danger.

We are concerned about the fact that there are not inspectors on the ground and, as you know, we tried at the United Nations to ensure that that would happen. There is a new resolution which requires the inspectors to go in and that is the law, the international law at this stage. Saddam Hussein has turned that down. And we, obviously, have reserved the right that if we see that he has or is reconstituting his weapons of mass destruction, that we can take action on that.

We want to make -- we have set up a regime whereby the inspectors could go in and that is the way that Saddam Hussein could make sure that sanctions might be suspended.

MR. RUSSERT: Let me show you what the President said a year ago and get your sense of it as we look at it today: ""A rather scary threat to regional stability becomes increasingly alarming. Iraq's dictator, Saddam Hussein is successfully staving off attempts at the United Nations to reinstate weapons inspectors in his country.""

One year ago, President Clinton himself summed up the likely consequences of allowing Mr. Hussein to go uninspected for too long. ""Mark my words, he will develop weapons of mass destruction, he will deploy them, he will use them.""

It's been more than a year. Aren't we concerned what Saddam has done this past year?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: We are obviously concerned. As I said, I think that we have been successful in keeping him in his box and in terms of the threat to the region. We worked very hard on this resolution. We think it is unfortunate that Saddam Hussein has not taken advantage of it because it -

MR. RUSSERT: And the Russians, French and Chinese oppose us.

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: Well, they abstained. But what's interesting here, Tim, in their as they call it explanation of vote at the United Nations, they made clear that they believed that Saddam Hussein must abide by what the United Nations -- the resolution is.

MR. RUSSERT: And if he doesn't, what happens?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: I think that we still continue to have the possibilities that we've had before of taking unilateral or multilateral action if we need to. But I think we should -- I can't say that we have accomplished everything we've wanted with Iraq. But we, I think, are on the right track in terms of keeping them, as I've said, in the box, of working with the opposition and working towards regime change, and making quite clear to the neighboring countries and to the rest of the world and our partners at the United Nations that what Saddam Hussein is doing is unacceptable.

MR. RUSSERT: Madam Secretary, we thank you for joining us. Happy new year.

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: Happy new year to you. Thank you.

Madeleine Albright,20010407,12/12/99 Albright interview on Face the Nation,"







QUESTION:  Madame Secretary, welcome.

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Thank you.

QUESTION:  You're here in our studio this morning.  A very troubling thing, it seems to me:  the State Department has now warned all Americans traveling abroad to take extra security precautions between now and the first week in January.  It says there is a possibility or you have information that there may be attacks planned where large gatherings of people are taking place, celebrations and so on.

What can you tell us about this?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Well, basically, we believe we have an obligation to let the American people know when there are potential terrorist threats, and we are concerned about Americans traveling abroad and being in large groups.  And we are suggesting that if they do travel abroad, that they be in touch with the American embassy and the consulate, and take care.

QUESTION:  Well, now, there will be some large gatherings in this country, of course, on New Year's Eve, Times Square, down on the mall here in Washington.  Do you have any security concerns about those gatherings?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  I think we always have to be vigilant, but the one that we put out was for Americans abroad and it is not something that, as we see it, is targeted against Americans here.

QUESTION:  You know, you do this -- the State Department does this from time to time, but this one seems a bit more ominous in some way.

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Well, I think we are concerned, obviously, because there are a lot of activities going on, and I think that there are more specific indications.  But we don't want to discourage people; we want people to be very vigilant and we want people to contact our embassies.  If people want more information, I suggest that they get in touch with our website, which is www.state.gov.

QUESTION:  Let me ask you, this is obviously aimed at -- you're worried about some sort of a terrorist attack.  Could it be Usama bin Ladin?  Is it anything to do with him?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Well, let me say there are a number of groups that we are watching, obviously.  For some time we have been concerned about Usama bin Ladin, but these are -- there are a variety of groups that we have been concerned about and are watching.  And we are concerned -- there is no question about it -- and we have to be vigilant, which is why we put out the warning.

QUESTION:  More than one group?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Probably, yes.

QUESTION:  Madame Secretary, peace talks start next week between Israel and Syria.  We have a wire report this morning that said that Syria's foreign minister is so optimistic that he is confident that a peace deal can be reached with Israel within a few months.

Do you agree with that assessment?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Well, you know, what is great is that this is the first time that we have had this kind of high-level meeting between a Syrian foreign minister and an Israeli prime minister, and I felt when I was on my trip there last week that there was a sense of optimism and a desire by both parties to stop talking about talking and getting down to negotiations.  There clearly are very hard decisions to be made and they are going to be talking about four basic areas; that is, withdrawal from the Golan Heights, the mutual security arrangements, the content or character of the peace, and the timetable.

And what we hope will happen while they're here this week is that they will set out the agenda for -- obviously, there will be more talks.  And I had a sense of optimism after I had my meeting with President Asad, but nobody should underestimate this is going to be tough going, but this is an amazing moment and there is a sense that a historic opportunity is present.

QUESTION:  Do you think this is the closest they've ever come right now?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Well, certainly they've never met at this level and I think that that is very hopeful, but I think there are lots of things that are going to have to be talked about.

QUESTION:  Let me also ask you, we have a wire story that says that this morning Israel signaled that it would look to United States taxpayers to bankroll any pullout from the Golan Heights.  Would we be willing to finance that?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  First of all, I think it's kind of premature to discuss it, but as a matter of record --

QUESTION:  They're saying it.

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Well, but I think that as a matter of record we've seen that after Camp David that the United States Congress and the administration came forward with some assistance after Wye.  And I think we've got to remember that if we manage this, this would be 50 years of work that will have been accomplished for a comprehensive peace that I think everybody will cheer and be happy to contribute to.

QUESTION:  You just called this an ""amazing moment.""  Tell me why it's an amazing moment.  What made it so?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Well, I think on my trip what was interesting was even from the minute that I landed in Saudi Arabia and met with the King and Crown Prince Abdallah, there was a sense there that they wanted -- they also, the Saudis, saw this as a time for moving forward and a time that we had to seize the opportunity.

And when I met with President Asad, I got a sense some 20 minutes into the meeting, that we were going a somewhat different direction, that there was -- again, that people were tired about negotiating about negotiations.  And Prime Minister Barak has had such energy about getting into the peace process issues and obviously has set deadlines for the Palestinian track.  And then when I met with Chairman Arafat, he also wanted to see that track move forward.

And what I have made quite clear is that we can do -- or they can -- we are there as the honest broker; the parties themselves have to make the decisions.  But this is a time when the tracks can move forward on their own speed and we are not going to do one track at the expense of another.

QUESTION:  Would we be interested in participating or leading an international peacekeeping force?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  I think that is a premature question, and I think that we'll see how it develops.  Neither party has asked us to do that, and I think we've got a ways to go before such questions can be answered.

QUESTION:  Madame Secretary, I have to ask you about this thing that happened last week.  We all learned about that somehow or another the Russians apparently put a very sophisticated listening device in a conference room on the very floor of the State Department where your office is.

Do you know yet how it got there or how long it's been there?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Well, first of all, let me say I consider this a very serious matter and we have worked very hard -- the Diplomatic Security Service has worked very hard with the FBI.  I was briefed about this a couple of months ago.  They had been working on this, and we stopped it; we discovered it. And I think that that's very important.

The other point I think is important for your viewers is, while it was on the same floor that I'm on, the State Department is a huge square building and this is on the other side of the square and the most sensitive offices, which are my corridor, none of those have been -- we've swept those and there was nothing there.

QUESTION:  But as yet, you don't know how it got there or how long it's been there?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Well, this is under investigation and I do not know the specifics of that, but I think that we are going about it just the right way.  We are very concerned about how this happened and tightened security, obviously.

QUESTION:  In a broader sense, does this say in some way that perhaps the Russians are stepping up their spy activities now?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  I wouldn't characterize that.  I think the thing that we have to remember is that spying is an old form, that it's always been going on.  It's our responsibility to protect ourselves against it.  We have to do a better job.  I have been consistently tightening security from where I found it.  We have specifically tightened a whole host of policies.

Our problem, to a great extent, is resources because at the same time that we're doing this we've got the problem with trying to make our buildings overseas secure against terrorists.

QUESTION:  Is it possible that there is a mole in the State Department?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  I'm not going to speculate on that.  They are questioning people in terms of trying to find out, you know, witnesses to things, but I'm not going to speculate on something like that.

QUESTION:  But the fact that they're questioning people, it makes you think that this could have been an inside job because they hid this bug in molding and --

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  I can't comment on the details of it, but the questioning is not in terms of questioning suspects; it's mainly trying to find out who saw what and trying to piece the story together.  And what I've done is, my Assistant Secretary for Security is not a diplomat. I can't disparage diplomats, but I now have a 27-year veteran of the Secret Service who is my Assistant Secretary, David Carpenter, and he is going about this in a very, very systematic way.

QUESTION:  Just one more question about this.  Do you know, or is it possible to know, if serious security leaks came out of this?  I mean, were there discussions in this room that we wouldn't have wanted the Russians to know about?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  This is not, as I said, in the most sensitive part of the State Department and, as far as we can tell, a lot of the meetings there were not the kind that would be the most secret or sensitive, as far as we know.

QUESTION:  Let's talk a little bit about this young boy that's become the center of this diplomatic situation between Cuba and the United States.  What's going to happen here, Madame Secretary?  Shouldn't this boy be sent back to his father?  I mean, in any court in this country when there is a father there, wouldn't he have rights over anyone else's rights?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Well, first of all, we have to remember that this is a case where there's a little boy involved in it and then, also, there are various legal provisions.  The Immigration and Naturalization Service is going through processing.  We have sought, or the INS has sought, to interview the boy's father and there has been no response from Cuba on that.  And I think that what we have to do is follow through the legal parts of this, and that is what we're doing.

QUESTION:  Will you return the boy without an interview?  Do you have to have an interview?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  I think that we believe that INS is doing the processing; they are the ones that are in charge of it.  I'm not going to speculate on that, but I think that the boy -- I mean, Bob just said that often the parental rights -- and what has to be established here are the parental rights and the father needs to be interviewed.

QUESTION:  Do you have any message to Fidel Castro on this?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Well, the main thing that I have is just a general message, is to remember that this is a little boy and not a political football.

QUESTION:  Let's talk a little bit about Russia.  Mr. Yeltsin this week said perhaps the United States has forgotten that we are a country with nuclear weapons.  Is that a threat?  Is that something you take seriously?  It sounds kind of scary on first hearing.

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Well, we don't take it as a threat and Prime Minister Putin indicated that it was not.  I think that we clearly are watching a very difficult situation in Russia -- a country that has been a superpower, our major adversary that is going through a very difficult time.

I think that was President Yeltsin was doing was basically reminding the world that Russia counts.  We met with President Yeltsin -- President Clinton and I -- in Istanbul.  He is a fierce defender of Russian national interests and energetic and, at the same time, we have a lot of business to do with Russia.

QUESTION:  Some people say that maybe he was just drunk.

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  I'm not -- you know, I think that he was stating the case that Russia needs to be recognized. And one of the problems, if you think about it, here was a country which for 70 years was out there as a superpower that's going through very, very difficult changes, and I think we have to recognize that.

QUESTION:  Realistically, Madame Secretary, what can we do about Chechnya?  You have a situation where the top Russian commander has said we won't allow these people to survive the winter.  What can you do?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Well, let me just say the Chechnya issue is, again, a very difficult one.  The Russians were concerned about terrorist threats.  They had buildings that were bombed in Moscow.  There was an attack by rebels from Chechnya into Dagestan.  And they were concerned about that.

The international community -- we, as leading it -- have made very clear that while they may have a terrorist problem they can not deal with this by indiscriminate bombing of civilians and that they need to understand that the only solution to this is a political solution.

What has been hopeful in the last day is that Prime Minister Putin has indicated that they are beginning to talk to some of the representatives of the Chechen leader Maskhadov.  There is a mission going from the OSCE in the next couple of days and the international community, the Europeans with us, have been talking about a political solution.  It is very bad -- there is no question -- and we're very concerned about the civilians.

QUESTION:  But you seem to see just a glimmer of maybe good news here?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Perhaps.  I want to be very realistic about this.  They have a goal:  they want to make sure that Chechnya does not keep causing them problems.  On the other hand, I think that they have understood the international pressure to some extent and there is a sense that Russia is becoming isolated.  We're having meetings next week in Europe.  I'm going to be in Berlin where we're meeting with the G-8.  The Russians are the eighth member of that.  And, clearly, this is going to be a topic of discussion and so they know that this is on our minds.

I have talked to Foreign Minister Ivanov practically every day.  We are either talking about resolutions at the UN or about Chechnya or various things, and they know how seriously we take this.

QUESTION:  Madame Secretary, thank you so much.  It's an understatement to say you've got a busy week ahead of you.

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Well, thank you.  It's great to be with you both.
