Marco Rubio, Secretary of State

Washington, D.C.

March 2, 2025

QUESTION:  Mr. Secretary, thank you for joining us this morning.  Has there been any contact with President Zelenskyy since Friday?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, I haven’t had any contact with him since Friday.  We have plenty of contacts with him, though.  Plenty.  I mean, he met – in the last ten days, he’s met with the Secretary of Commerce – he spoke to the President on the phone, met with the Secretary of Commerce, met with me, met with the Vice President, met with our special envoy, and then was invited and came over on – invited.  He wanted to come over on Friday to sign this commercial deal that didn’t happen.  So there’s been plenty of contact with them.  I’ve talked to the foreign minister several times – not since then.  And we’ll see moving forward.

I think the last line in the President’s Truth Social post is the one to focus in on, and that is we’ll be ready to reengage when they’re ready to make peace, which is clearly what the President’s goal is here.  He’s trying to get Russia to the table to bring about – to see if there’s a way to bring about an end to this conflict.  That’s his goal.  That’s his only goal.  That’s his centralized focus.  And hopefully, we’ll get to a point where that’s possible.

QUESTION:  The British prime minister said this morning that the United Kingdom and France are working on a peace plan with Ukraine to present to the U.S.  Do you know where things stand with that plan?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  No.  I mean, I’ve talked to both of the foreign ministers of France and the UK yesterday, and I explained to them sort of the events leading up to what you saw on Friday.

Look, I think what’s really important here is to understand the dynamic.  The President is basically saying there’s this horrible war, it’s been going on for three years, it is a bloody stalemate, a meatgrinder type war, and he wants it to end.  How does it end?  It’s very simple.  The only way it ends is if Vladimir Putin comes to a negotiating table.  And right now, President Trump is the only person on Earth who has any chance whatsoever of bringing him to a table to see what it is he would be willing to end the war on.

Now, maybe their claims or what they want, their demands, will be unreasonable.  We don’t know, but we have to bring them to the table.   You’re not going to bring them to the table if you’re calling them names, if you’re being antagonistic.  That’s just the President’s instincts from years and years and years of putting together deals as someone who’s in business.  And that’s the only goal here is —

QUESTION:  Well, let me just stop you there for one second.  Why is it —

SECRETARY RUBIO:  — to try to bring about an end to – a freer world – a war with no end in sight.

QUESTION:  Why is it okay to call President Zelenskyy —

SECRETARY RUBIO:  All right, I’m sorry.

QUESTION:  Why is it okay to call President Zelenskyy a dictator but not, as you say, call Vladimir Putin names?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  We’ve spent three years calling Vladimir Putin names.  That’s not the point now.  The point that we’re at now is we’re trying to get the man to a table.  The Russians – and I’ve said from the very beginning maybe they don’t want a deal either.  We don’t know.  But we haven’t talked to them in three years, but maybe they do.

The point is do we want to make – I would ask everybody this:  If there are no negotiations, what is the alternative?  Another four years of war, another three years of war, in which the United States and Europe continues to pour billions of dollars into a war in Ukraine?  Is that the alternative?

I’ve asked every foreign minister I meet with, “Tell me your idea of how this turns out.”  Most don’t have a plan.  A few have said, well, let’s give them another year of fighting, a year from now, a year later, after another year of death, another year of destruction, then maybe Putin will be ready to negotiate at that point.  That doesn’t sound like a good plan to me, and it certainly is not a plan the President is on board with.

QUESTION:  It’s not just about getting people to the table.  It’s about keeping agreements that are made.  And that was one of the points that President Zelenskyy was making in the Oval Office on Friday is that Vladimir Putin has not kept the agreements that were made in the past.  Wasn’t he right about that?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  But what is – moving forward is the question, not the past.  No one here is claiming Vladimir Putin is going to get the Nobel Peace Prize this year or that he should be the man of the year of the humanitarian association.  What we’re arguing here is he has a very large country, they’re on full war footing, they’re cranking out weapons now at a war-footing pace, and we need to figure out is there a way to get them to stop the war.  And the only way you’re going to do that is to get Russians engaged in negotiations – something the Europeans haven’t been able to do, the Biden administration wasn’t able to do or didn’t even try.

That’s the goal here.  It’s that simple.  Can we try to sit with them and figure out whether there’s any – what are the Russian demands?  Under what conditions would the Russians be willing to stop this war?  And as I said, we don’t know what those are because we haven’t talked to them in three years.  That’s the singular goal here is to try to bring about an end to this conflict, and it begins by getting them to the table.

Ultimately, like any truce, like any peace agreement anywhere in the world, those things will have to be enforced.  They’ll have to be enduring.  There will have to be safeguards put in place.  Everybody understands that.  But it begins with the first step, and that is engaging them to see if it’s even possible.  Because if it’s not possible, then what we’re looking at is a protracted stalemate with thousands of people dying, billions of dollars pouring in, and more death and destruction.  And that’s not something the President wants to be a part of.  He’s made it very clear.

QUESTION:  Aren’t those talks feasible only if the United States is willing to also provide security guarantees to Ukraine?  That was the point that President Zelenskyy was also making in the Oval Office.

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, the security guarantees – which I actually like to call deterrence – is all contingent upon there being a peace.  Everybody is saying security guarantees to secure the peace.  You first have to have a peace.  We don’t even know if the peace is possible.  And that – this was understood by the Ukrainians.  It was explained to them repeatedly, and that is here’s our strategy, we’re trying to get Putin to a negotiating table.  Don’t – let’s not – everyone knows the history here, the back and forth.  We understand that.  We all understand that.

But the question now is can we get them to a table to negotiate.  That’s our goal.  Don’t do anything to disrupt that.  And that’s what Zelenskyy did, unfortunately, is he found every opportunity to try to Ukraine-splain on every issue, then he confronts the Vice President.  When the Vice President says the goal here is diplomacy, he immediately jumps in and challenges the Vice President – well, what kind of diplomacy?  So we all understand, okay, that Putin is not going to be an easy negotiator in this regard.  We all get that.  But we have to – we have to start the process to see if something is even possible.

And I honestly am puzzled.  I just don’t understand.  The Biden administration berated Benjamin Netanyahu and the Israelis, put all kinds of conditions and pressure on them to try to get a ceasefire.  In this particular case, we’ve been nice by comparison.  And all we’re trying to do here is figure out whether a peace is possible.  All these other things that people keep bringing up, that’ll have to be a part of a negotiation.  Right now there is no negotiation.  Shouldn’t we at least try to see if there is a way to end this war in a way that’s acceptable to both sides and is enduring and sustainable?  How is that a bad thing?  I really am puzzled why anyone thinks that trying to be a peacemaker is a bad thing.  It’s only a bad thing when it’s Donald Trump trying to do it, when it’s President Trump.  It’s absurd to me.

QUESTION:  Well, even some of your Republican allies are puzzled by the steps that President Trump has taken to placate Vladimir Putin.  I want to bring up a post that Lisa Murkowski —

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, which ones?  What steps has the President taken to placate —

QUESTION:  Let me show —

SECRETARY RUBIO:  What steps has he taken?

QUESTION:  Let me show you —

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Are we arming the Russians?

QUESTION:  — what Lisa Murkowski said and your —

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Are we providing economic assistance to the Russians?  Have we given the Russians $180 billion?  What does that mean, “to placate”?

QUESTION:  Let me ask you the question.  This is Lisa Murkowski and here’s what she says:  “This week started with administration officials refusing to acknowledge that Russia started the war in Ukraine.  It ends with a tense and shocking conversation in the Oval Office and whispers from the White House that they may try to end all U.S. support for Ukraine.  I know foreign policy is not for the faint of heart, but right now I am sick to my stomach as the administration appears to be walking away from our allies and embracing Putin – a threat to democracy and U.S. values around the world.”  Those are not my words.  That’s Senator Lisa Murkowski.  What’s your response?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, yeah, we’re a free country.  People have a right to these opinions.  I would just say to you, “What have we done to placate the Russians?”  The only thing we’ve done is say are you guys willing to talk about peace.  I say the same point.  We’re not giving – we haven’t given Russia $180 billion in weapons.  We haven’t given them an Oval Office meeting.

QUESTION:  You voted with North Korea and Russia and – you voted with North Korea and Russia and Belarus in the United Nations and against our Western allies.

SECRETARY RUBIO:  No, let me tell you.  All right, so you know what the – do you know what the United Nations resolution was?  I’ll tell you if you want to hear what it was.  It basically said this has been a horrible war, it’s time for it to end, the job of the UN is to bring about peace in the world.  I thought that’s what the UN was created to do – to stop wars and to prevent them.  And that’s what the resolution did.

Was it antagonistic towards the Russians?  No.  Back to the point.  But it also didn’t praise the Russians.  All it said is this is a bad war, it needs to end.  And by the way, at the Security Council, which has not been widely reported, the first resolution on Ukraine that has passed the Security Council in three years passed this week because of the leadership of President Trump, and it’s a resolution that said bad war, needs to end, let’s bring the two sides together.  That’s what the resolution is.

Again, what is the United Nations for?  Isn’t it not a forum to promote peace in the world?  And shouldn’t our president – shouldn’t we all be happy that we have a president who’s trying to stop wars and prevent them instead of start them?  And I just don’t get it, I really don’t, other than the fact that it’s Donald J. Trump.  If this was a Democrat that was doing this, everyone would be saying, well, he’s on his way to the Nobel Peace Prize.  This is absurd.  We are trying to end a war.  You cannot end a war unless both sides come to the table, starting with the Russians, and that is the point the President has made.  And we have to do whatever we can to try to bring them to the table to see if it’s even possible.

I’m not promising you it’s possible.  I’m not telling you it’s 90 percent likely.  I’m saying it’s 0 percent likely if we don’t get them to a negotiating table.  And the sooner everyone grows up around here and figures out that this is a bad war that’s heading in a bad direction with death and destruction and all kinds of danger surrounding it that could spiral into a broader conflict, the sooner people grow up and realize that, I think the more progress we’re going to be able to make.

But the President is crystal clear.  He campaigned on it and he’s going to govern on it, and that is he is going to be a president that tries to achieve peace.  And he has been very clear this is a war that would have never happened had Donald Trump been in the White House, and it needs to end, and we’re going to do everything we can to end it in an enduring and sustainable and fair way.

QUESTION:  You said in your confirmation hearings that Russia will have to make concessions to get a peace deal.  What concessions do you expect them to make?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, why would I say that on a news broadcast?  That’s what negotiations are about.  That’s the problem here.  Again, everybody is – this is not a messaging exercise, okay?  This is can they get to a table, and then there’s hard work to be done.  You’re absolutely right; I’m not telling you this is an easy peace deal.  The Russians will give you a 30-minute lecture on the history of Ukraine and this, that, and the other.  The Ukrainians have their own point of view.  There’s no doubt about it.

But what peace deal in the history of the world has ever been easy?  That’s the hard work of diplomacy.  That’s exactly what the Vice President was alluding to.  That’s what peace deals involve.  You’ve covered this.  You’ve been around for a long time.  These conflicts are not easy to solve.  We’re getting – but you can’t solve them at all if you don’t even have a process to try to solve it, if you don’t have the parties at the table.

And right now that’s been our goal.  It’s been explained crystal clear to the Ukrainians and the Europeans and everyone else who wants to know for weeks now, for weeks now.  And the only thing they were told was do not do things to derail it.  And sadly, President Zelenskyy couldn’t contain himself in that regard.  I hope this could all be reset.  I hope he comes to the realization that we’re actually trying to help his country here before it suffers thousands of more casualties.  Three million people have already left Ukraine.  Are they ever going to be able to come back?  He’s got Ukrainians being held prisoner, including children, on the Russian side.  All this is – why is any of this good for anybody?  And the argument that we’re going to just keep it going forever, that’s absurd.

So it’s time to bring the Russians to the table if it’s even possible and see if there is a way forward that ends this conflict and makes sure it never happens again.  That’s our goal.  That remains our goal.  That’s the President’s goal.

QUESTION:  Mr. Secretary, thanks for your time this morning.

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Thank you.

Marco Rubio, Secretary of State

February 28, 2025

QUESTION:  And my source tonight is the Secretary of State, who was in that room today, Marco Rubio.  Thank you so much, Secretary Rubio, for being here.  We just heard from President Zelenskyy.  He said he does not think that he owes President Trump an apology for what happened inside the Oval Office today.  Do you feel otherwise?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  I do.  I do.  Because you guys don’t see – you guys only saw the end.  You saw what happened today.  You don’t see all the things that led up to this, so let me explain.  The President’s been very clear; he campaigned on this.  He thinks this war should have never started.  He believes – and I agree – that had he been president it never would have happened.  Now here we are.  He’s trying to bring an end to this conflict.  We’ve explained very clearly what our plan is here, which is we want to get the Russians to a negotiating table.  We want to explore whether peace is possible.  They understand this.  They also understand that this agreement that was supposed to be signed today was supposed to be an agreement that binds America economically to Ukraine, which, to me, as I’ve explained and I think the President alluded to today, is a security guarantee in its own way because we’re involved; it’s now us, it’s our interests.

That was all explained.  That was all understood.  And nonetheless, for the last 10 days in every engagement we’ve had with the Ukrainians there’s been complications in getting that point across, including the public statements that President Zelenskyy has made.  But they insisted on coming to D.C.  This agreement could have been signed five days ago, but they insisted on coming to Washington and there was a very – and should have been a very clear understanding:  Don’t come here and create a scenario where you’re going to start lecturing us about how diplomacy isn’t going to work.  President Zelenskyy took it in that direction and it ended in a predictable outcome as a result.  It’s unfortunate.  That wasn’t supposed to be this way, but that’s the path he chose, and I think, frankly, sends his country backwards in regards to achieving peace, which is what President Trump wants at the end of the day – is for this war to end.  He’s been as consistent as anyone can be about what his objective is here.

QUESTION:  But what specifically do you want to see President Zelenskyy apologize for?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, apologize for turning this thing into the fiasco for him that it became.  There was no need for him to go in there and become antagonistic.  Look, this thing went off the rails.  You were there, I believe.  It went off the rails when he said:  Let me ask you a question – to the Vice President – what kind of diplomacy are you talking about?  Well, these – this is a serious thing.  I mean, thousands of people have been killed – thousands – and he talks about all these horrible things that have happened to prisoners of war and children.  All true, all bad.  This is what we’re dealing with here.  It needs to come to an end.  We are trying to bring it to an end.

The way you bring it to an end is you get Russia to the table to talk, and he understands that.  Attacking Putin, no matter how anyone may feel about him personally, forcing the President into a position where you’re trying to goad him into attacking Putin, calling him names, maximalist demands about Russia having to pay for the reconstruction – all the sorts of things that you talk about in a negotiation.  Well, when you start talking about that aggressively – and the President’s a deal maker, he’s made deals his entire life – you’re not going to get people to the table.  And so you start to perceive that maybe Zelenskyy doesn’t want a peace deal.  He says he does, but maybe he doesn’t.  And that act of open undermining of efforts to bring about peace is deeply frustrating for everyone who’s been involved in communications with them leading up to today.  And I think he should apologize —

QUESTION:  But can I ask you —

SECRETARY RUBIO:  — for wasting our time for a meeting that was going to end the way it did.

QUESTION:  You yourself have said previously that Putin cannot be trusted in negotiations.  That was the point that President Zelenskyy was ultimately making during that conversation, is that there cannot be an agreement without security guarantees, because he was talking about all the ceasefire agreements before or agreements that Putin has just blown past.  I mean, do you still feel that way, that Putin cannot be trusted in these negotiations?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, I was there yesterday when the President said in front of the media that our approach is going to be trust but verify.  Donald Trump has made – President Trump’s made deals his entire life.  He’s not going to get suckered into some deal that’s not a real deal.  We all understand this.  We understand it on our end for certain.  And so the goal here is to get to a place – we have to explore whether peace is possible.  I’ve said this repeatedly.  I don’t know; I think it is based on what they’ve said so far.  But we have to explore that.

How else is this war going to end?  I ask people:  What is the European plan to end this war?  I can tell you what one foreign minister told me, and I’m not going to say who it was but I can tell you what one of them told me, and that is that the war goes on for another year and at that point Russia will feel so weakened that they’ll beg for peace.  That’s another year of killing, another year of dying, another year of destruction, and by the way, not a very realistic plan in my point of view.

So if there’s a chance at peace, even if it’s a 1 percent chance, that needs to be explored – and that’s what President Trump is trying to do here.

QUESTION:  President Trump said just when he was leaving the White House after that meeting that he doesn’t think President Zelenskyy wants peace.  But isn’t that why the Ukrainian leader was in the Oval Office for that meeting today?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, he was in the Oval Office to sign a minerals rights deal.  That’s what he was in the Oval Office to sign today.  But again, when you have comments that deliberately – appear to be deliberately – I mean, after having discussed this repeatedly, deliberately appear to be geared towards making the argument that peace is not possible.  Again, I turn to the – he turns to the Vice President:  What kind of diplomacy are you talking about?  Almost as if to say, these people, you can’t deal with them; we can’t – you can’t have any negotiations with Putin because he can’t be trusted and you’re just wasting your time on negotiations.  Well, he’s directly, basically, undermining everything the President has told him he’s trying to do.

Look, there’s no need for that.  You start to suspect, does he really want an end to this war?  Does he just think that we have to do whatever he says and give him anything he wants without any end game?  That was the Biden strategy.  That was the Biden strategy.  We were funding a stalemate.  We were funding a meatgrinder.  And unfortunately for the Ukrainians, the Russians have more meat to grind, and they don’t care about human life.  We’ve seen it – human waves, the North Koreans, et cetera.  And so this is a very complex thing, it’s very delicate, it’s very costly, it’s very bloody.  It needs to be brought to and end.  But it isn’t going to be brought to an end with public pronouncements and maximalist demands in the public, but in real diplomacy.  The Vice President was right.

QUESTION:  When you say they don’t care about life, you – are you talking about the Russians or the Ukrainians?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, the Russians.  I mean, they’re conscripting by the hundreds of thousands.  They’ve brought in —

QUESTION:  Okay, I just —

SECRETARY RUBIO:  — North Korean troops that were slaughtered in Kursk, and they keep going because they’ve got more people.  That’s the other fact.  Look, and it’s – again, we go back to the same point.  I’m not going to fall into this trap of who’s bad and who’s evil.  People can make those conclusions.  People have seen how this narrative has played out and where we are today and how this all started and so forth.  The point now is it has to end, and the way it ends is you get people to a negotiating table.  And the President, who’s the ultimate deal maker, knows you don’t get people to a negotiating table when you’re calling them names and you’re accusing them of things.  Because at the end of the day this is not a political campaign, okay?  This is high-stakes international diplomacy and an effort to bring about an end to a very, very dangerous war.

QUESTION:  But you yourself, sir, have said before that you believe Putin is a war criminal, that that is a widely accepted fact.  You’ve called him a butcher, and you’ve said that as the Secretary of State you do believe it’s important for someone with such global influence as you have to speak with that kind of moral clarity.

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Yeah, and at this moment as Secretary of State, my job working for the President is to deliver peace, to end this conflict and end this war.  Ultimately, that is the job of the State Department.  The State Department doesn’t fight wars, it ends them.  It tries to end them.  And that’s usually, by the way, celebrated.  I mean, throughout history I’ve watched presidents that bring about an end to wars and conflicts, and people celebrate that.  They applaud it.  I think we should be very proud and happy that we have a President whose prime objective is not to get into wars but to prevent wars and to get out of wars.  That is a very noble, laudable goal.  Everyone should be applauding it, and he should be given the space to do that – not undermined by demands that he call Putin names or that we say things that impede the ability to conduct real diplomacy, as the Vice President said today.

QUESTION:  To follow up on what you just said a moment ago, are you saying that you’re – you have doubts that President Zelenskyy wants this war to come to an end?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  What I have doubts about is whether he’s willing to say and do the things that we need in order to get a negotiation.  Again, you – this has been going on for 10 days, and to see things in the press saying we’re not coordinating with the Ukrainians, that’s absolutely false.  Over the last 10 days the Ukrainians have met with the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of State, the Vice President of the United States, had a phone call with President Trump, and he was in the Oval Office today.  I’ve talked to the foreign minister of Ukraine three times in the last 10 days.  The argument that we’re not engaging – but yet you keep reading these press accounts about, oh, well, they’re leaving us out, we’re not involved, we’re not engaged.  None of these things are true and it continues.

So all that led up to today and a deep sense of frustration, and my hope is that this all can be reset and maturity can kick in and some pragmatism, because this war – tonight, people will die in Ukraine.  Tonight, people will die in this conflict.  We’re trying to bring an end to this conflict, which is unsustainable.  It’s an unsustainable, bloody war that has to come to an end.  And right now the only leader in the world that can even have a chance of bringing about an end to this is named President Donald Trump, and we need to give him the opportunity to try and do that.  And when you see efforts to impede it, when you – when you tell someone don’t say – let’s not talk about these things, let’s not go in this direction because it makes it harder for us to engage, and they insist on doing it anyways, you start to wonder.  You start to wonder.  I don’t like to impugn people’s motives, but you start to wonder what’s behind it.

So look, again, let’s hope that this —

QUESTION:  Can I ask you, Secretary Rubio —

SECRETARY RUBIO:  — can be salvaged, but I’m not sure after today.

QUESTION:  You don’t believe that this can be – you’re not sure that this can be salvaged?  I mean, can this relationship between Zelenskyy and Trump be repaired, in your view?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  I think anything is possible, but it has to go back to the point that President Trump is interested in being involved in this for the purposes of bringing about an enduring and lasting peace.  That’s what he wants to achieve.  And I think if I’m a country, okay, that’s involved in a war with a bigger country, who’s losing thousands of people, who’s had 3 million people leave my country because they can’t be there, who every – is facing these challenges, I would be thanking a president who’s trying to help bring about an end to this war.  I would be thanking him and I would be supportive of what he’s trying to do, at least in my public pronouncements and in my public posture.  And we didn’t see that today, and we haven’t seen that for the last few days.

Now, will that change?  I hope so.  It should for the purposes of global peace and stability in Europe and around the world.

QUESTION:  Vice President Vance was criticizing Zelenskyy for not saying thank you specifically during that meeting, those 40 to 50 minutes that we were in the Oval Office.  But certainly you know very well, Secretary Rubio – your time as a senator here in Washington – that whenever Zelenskyy has come to Washington before, he has very much expressed that kind of gratitude.  Just listen to this:

PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY:  Thank you for both financial packages you have already provided us.

Really, all my appreciations from my heart, from the heart of Ukrainians, all Ukrainians.

So what can I say to American people in English?  My English is poor.  To say all my messages and all my thanks to you.

And thank you very much for supporting us, our people.

(Via interpreter) Thank you, United States.  Thank you, America.

(Via interpreter) Ukraine is grateful to the United States for its overwhelming support.

QUESTION:  Do you think you can make the argument that he hasn’t said thank you?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, I think the Vice President said he hadn’t said it today, he hadn’t heard it today in that meeting.  And we were hoping that that meeting would begin by:  Thank you for everything you’ve done for us, we wouldn’t be where we are today without you, we wouldn’t even have a chance to negotiate a peace without the help you gave us.  By the way, without the help you gave us when you were president in the first term, because President Obama refused to provide them defensive capabilities in terms of military hardware.  He did provide them blankets —

QUESTION:  Yeah, and that was brought up today during that meeting.

SECRETARY RUBIO:  — he did provide them humanitarian aid, but – well, but – it was brought up, but I was there.  In fact, I vividly recall at the time Vice President Biden saying to me in a meeting that we had at the vice president’s residence that the reason why we didn’t want to provide them those weapons is because they might use them.  That was his exact quote and that was the attitude.

I remember clearly then the Ukrainian leaders saying we don’t need more blankets or MREs, we need weapons to defend ourselves.  And they didn’t do it.  President Trump did.  He provided them weaponry, some of it – much of it – which was used at the beginning of this war, and without those weapons being in their stocks, this war could have been over very quickly – two, three, four days.

Another potshot that Zelenskyy took today – when the President pointed that out, you know what Zelenskyy said?  He said, yeah, yeah, we’ve heard that from the Russians.  That’s not a Russian narrative.  That was the official position, okay, of the United States.  I vividly recall being briefed by leaders in the Biden administration telling us that this war was going to be over in five to six days.  They believed that.  That was their assessment at the time, and it wasn’t the case because of the weapons that Ukraine had in stocks because of President Trump in his first term.  So he should have been grateful for that and grateful for what we’re doing now.

And one more point:  It’s not just President Trump.  There’s – there’s news reports out there from NBC News, at least is one of the places I recall, reporting that Biden had a shouting match with Zelenskyy for not being grateful and not being thankful for everything that was provided back in 2022.  Now, that didn’t happen in front of the press.  That was leaked, but it got out there.  It’s had – these frustrations are not unique to President Trump.  There was those frustrations in the previous administration, if NBC News is to be believed.

QUESTION:  Yeah, right, but obviously we’ve never seen anything like what we saw today.  But the point that Zelenskyy was making there is that everyone predicted his demise, and Ukraine was able to fight and to survive.  Zelenskyy was able to survive; the Ukrainian people have been fighting for three years.  You yourself have said previously that the United States should assist Ukraine as long as the Ukrainians are willing to fight.  So I think the question coming out of that meeting is:  What happens next here?  I mean, you are the U.S. chief diplomat.  Is there a path for diplomacy?  Is a ceasefire still a possibility tonight?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, number one, you know who else said that Ukraine is very brave and very valiant?  President Trump.  He said it today.  He said it repeatedly – your soldiers have been very brave, your fighters have been very brave, your people have been very brave.  He said that repeatedly, and everyone recognizes that.  But we’re three years into a war that has no end in sight and no exit strategy.  The EU doesn’t have an exit strategy.  I saw the comments tonight from the leader of the EU saying that we need a new leader of the – of the free world.  I mean, these people are just playing silly games and saying these things.  What is their exit strategy?  What is anybody else’s exit strategy?  The only person on the planet who is actively trying to bring an end to this conflict is named Donald Trump, the President of the United States.  He’s the only one that’s trying to do it and we should be helping him to achieve it.

QUESTION:  Can I ask you –

SECRETARY RUBIO:  And so do I think it’s possible?  Yeah, I hope it’s possible, because that’s what we do try to do at the Department of State, is we try to bring end to conflicts, not start new ones and certainly not extend them.

(Break.)

QUESTION:  Senator Lindsey Graham, after having lunch with President Trump today, said Zelenskyy either needs to resign or they need to send someone over that we can do business with.  Do you feel that President Zelenskyy needs to resign?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, that’s Lindsey’s feeling, because he feels very passionately.  He’s been a very strong supporter of Ukraine.  Lindsey Graham has been one of the strongest voices for Ukraine.

QUESTION:  But what is the United States’s position?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, the United States – the President’s taken no position on that.  What he said today is let him come back when he’s ready to do peace.  That’s what he said.  Let him come back when he’s ready to do peace.  So I can’t speak for what anybody else said.  I can only go off the words from the President of the United States, and that is today we’re not – this is not going to be productive any further.  When Zelenskyy’s ready to make peace and he’s serious about peace, let him come back then, and that’s when we’ll re-engage with them.

And what he means by that is he understands —

QUESTION:  And how will you measure that?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, I think it’s everything I’ve said already, and that is:  How are you going to get Vladimir Putin and the Russian Federation to a table to discuss even the opportunity, whether there – even to explore whether there’s an opportunity for peace?  You’re not going to do it by calling him names.  It makes everybody feel very good.  You can pass resolutions, you can put out very strongly worded statements.  Senators can do it.  I did when I was in the Senate.  House members can do it, commentators can do it, and countries that have no real skin in the game can do it.  But when you are the President of the United States of America and you’re trying to bring about peace the way Donald Trump is trying to bring about peace, the only way to do it is you have to create space for people to come to the table and talk.  And that is something we should all be applauding, not criticizing —

QUESTION:  The one —

SECRETARY RUBIO:  — and not pretending that we can just extend this war forever until – and that everybody has unlimited resources to continue to fund it – on both sides, by the way.

QUESTION:  And President Zelenskyy has said he does want this war to end, he just cares about how it ends.  We heard that from the other European leaders who came to the Oval Office also this week.  President Trump said to me today before that shouting match erupted in the Oval Office that he doesn’t believe there have to be security guarantees in place before the ceasefire, that you can come to a ceasefire agreement and then put those in place.  Do you agree with that?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  That’s not what he said.  What he said is why am I going to be talking about security guarantees, let me get a peace deal first, is what he said.  That doesn’t mean they can’t happen —

QUESTION:  Right.

SECRETARY RUBIO:  — as part of that negotiation, but you have to an agreement.  What is there – what peace is there to secure if you first don’t have an agreement on peace?  Like, what do the Russians need in order to end this conflict?  What do the Ukrainians need?

QUESTION:  So you’re saying it would happen as part of the negotiations?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, again, why do you end a war?  You have to find out what the combatants require in order to stop shooting at each other.  What are the Russians’ needs?  What do they need to see in order for them to stop fighting?  What do the Ukrainians need in order to stop fighting?  And then once you have that in place, then you can decide the next step, which is, and what do we need to do to make sure this never happens again – that it doesn’t happen in two years, three years, five years?  I don’t think President Trump is interested in a one-year ceasefire; I don’t think he’s interested in a six-month ceasefire.  He wants this thing to end.  He has said that repeatedly.

But again, he’s not going to use the kind of language that maybe plays well in the public sphere and the political sphere for people that want to take shots at him but it’s not going to allow us to have a negotiation or even to explore a potential negotiation.  President Donald Trump is a man who’s made deals his entire life in business, and he’s bringing those principles to government, and he’s the only one in the world that has any chance.  If Donald Trump tomorrow decides I don’t care about Ukraine, I don’t care about Russia, and I don’t care about this war, and he walks away, I ask you – I ask everyone – well, who on this planet has any chance whatsoever, even a 1 percent chance, of getting the combatants to the table?  The answer is there is no one.  He is the only one on Earth right now that has any chance.  If there is a chance at peace, he’s the only one that has a chance to deliver on it.

QUESTION:  Is he – do you still see a meeting happening with President Putin there, President Zelenskyy, and President Trump?  Is that still possible?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, I think that’s premature.  I mean, what would they – you first need to make sure that this is even a possibility and you have to explore it.  And look, there’s good signs, I think, maybe, somewhat about at least the Russians’ willingness to engage.  And – but we have to explore all that.  But that’s not going to be done in front of cameras, it’s not going to be done in an open ballroom.  There’s a lot of work to be done before we get to this point.  This is a complex war that has causes behind it that go back a number of years.  There’s a lot to navigate, a lot that’s been invested on both sides.  Gains have been made by the Russian Federation in some places.  All of these things have to be worked through, but it’s not going to be done through press conferences and in the media.  It has to be done through what the Vice President said today: the serious work of diplomacy.

It’s – it’s a lot easier to just say, well, we’re with Ukraine all the way no matter what, however long it takes.  Well, 15 years?

QUESTION:  Yeah.

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Twelve years?  I mean, that’s absurd.  That’s not sustainable and everybody knows it.  The President wants to end this war.  He wants to explore whether there’s the possibility to do it and do it quickly.  He campaigned on it.  It was a promise of his and he intends to – when he says these things, he doesn’t just say them, he means them.  And he’s doing it, and it’s the first time we’ve seen that in a long time in American politics.

QUESTION:  Secretary Marco Rubio, thank you for your time tonight and joining us on such a historic day.  I really do appreciate your time.

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Thank you.

July 10, 2025

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Hello, boys and girls.

QUESTION:  Good evening, Secretary.

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Hello.  How are you doing?

QUESTION:  Mr. – are you doing remarks?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Should I?  (Laughter.)  Sure enough.  I’m sure we’ve covered all your questions.  Go ahead.

QUESTION:  We have a long —

QUESTION:  What was your message to the Russian foreign minister today?  And what is the Trump Administration’s strategy now to end the Ukraine war?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Our strategy is to continue to engage all the parties that are involved in finding an outcome to this conflict.  We will engage anytime that we have an opportunity to do so, like we did today.  I echoed what the President said – both the disappointment and frustration at the lack of progress in peace talks or in a path forward.  So, we’ll continue to engage.

We shared some ideas and comments, which I’ll take back to Washington as early as this evening in terms of calls and reflected, and perhaps there’s something to build on there.  So – but it was a frank conversation.  It was an important one.  We had it, and we talked about some other items as well unrelated to the war in Ukraine, but that was the – obviously, the first and foremost topic that we discussed.  And look, the President’s been pretty clear.  He’s disappointed and frustrated that there’s not been more flexibility on the Russian side to bring about an end to this conflict.  We hope that can change, and we’re going to continue to stay involved where we see opportunities to make a difference.

QUESTION:  Mr. Secretary —

QUESTION:  Without speaking for the foreign minister, which I know you don’t want to know to do —

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Which foreign minister?

QUESTION:  This one.

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Oh, Sergei Lavrov.

QUESTION:  Mr. Lavrov.

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Yes.

QUESTION:  Yeah.  Without speaking for him, do you get the sense that they’re moving towards flexibility or —

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Yeah, I’m not going to characterize our conversation other than to tell you that I expressed what the President said publicly, which is that we feel as if we’ve dedicated a lot of time and energy to this matter and just not enough progress has been made.  We need to see a roadmap moving forward about how this conflict can conclude, and then we shared some ideas about what that might look like.  And obviously, I’ll take that back to the President here as early as this evening, and hopefully there’s something that we can build on there.  But we’ll —

QUESTION:  Secretary —

QUESTION:  Mr. Secretary —

QUESTION:  — a couple of months ago, you said that what was necessary to end this war would be a conversation between President Trump and President Putin, but there have now been multiple phone calls between the two of them, and yet the war in Ukraine goes on.  Does this speak to any weakness, in terms of the President’s ability to negotiate an end to this conflict?  Or why does it persist, despite them having spoken?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, this is a war that the President inherited, right?  He got elected, and it had already been going on, and no progress had been made up to that point towards peace of any kind.  In fact, there had not even been any meetings between the Ukrainians and the Russians for quite some time.  So, while there’s been some humanitarian exchanges made – obviously, that’s our goal here is to end this war and any role we can play.

So, this is not a war that started under President Trump.  It’s a war that wouldn’t have happened had he been president, but now it’s here.  And we’ll continue to engage and do everything we can and hopefully make progress.  As I said, and I said repeatedly, look, we are – if we see an opportunity to make a difference in this, we’re going to take it and we’re going to pursue it.  And that’s what the President has done.  And he deserves tremendous credit for having multiple phone calls with leaders from both countries —

QUESTION:  With sanctions?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  — and anybody else.

QUESTION:  Mr. Secretary —

QUESTION:  Mr. Secretary, Poland —

QUESTION:  — the – Russia has launched its most massive attacks in the last three days.  And you, of course, saw your counterpart today.  Are you willing now to put stronger sanctions on Russia?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, the President has said that that’s an option that’s available to him – both under existing authorities, but primarily if the Senate and the House can pass legislation that gives him the opportunity to do that.  So, we’ve been engaging with Congress on what that bill would like.  Obviously, the President needs flexibility on how those sanctions would be applied and when, because it gives him maximum leverage in any conversation and negotiation.  So, he has talked about that as being a real option.

And now obviously, we’ll – we’ve been engaging with the Senate in particular over the last week on what that bill would look like, and the leaders of both chambers have said that they’re prepared to begin to move forward on that.  We’ve expressed this to the Russians weeks ago.  We told them that the moment would come where something like this could happen, and we’ll continue to express it because that’s the reality.

QUESTION:  But has the moment come, or not yet?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, again, that’s the President’s decision to make.  We are – obviously, he’s frustrated by the fact that more progress has not been made.

QUESTION:  Mr. Secretary —

QUESTION:  Mr. Secretary —

QUESTION:  — there were reports earlier this week that you and the President were unaware that the Pentagon had made a decision to at least temporarily halt the arms shipments to Ukraine.  Were you – what’s your take on that decision by the Pentagon?  And what is your general take —

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, I think that decision has been —

QUESTION:  — on the arm shipments?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Yeah, that decision unfortunately was mischaracterized.  It was a pause, pending review, on a handful of specific type munitions.  That frankly is something that is logical that you would do, especially after an extended engagement that we saw both in defense of Israel and in defense of our own bases.  And so, it was a very limited review of certain types of munitions to ensure that we had sufficient stockpiles.  And it’s typical when you do these reviews that there’s a short term pause because if, in fact, the review comes back that you have a shortage, you can’t pull it back once it’s been sent.  But generally speaking, aid to Ukraine continues along the schedule that Congress appropriated.

QUESTION:  Mr. Secretary —

QUESTION:  Which types were paused?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Huh?

QUESTION:  Which types of weapons were paused?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Largely defensive in nature.  Some were offensive.  But again, the ones that were expended in recent conflicts in the Middle East – and again, not because there is a shortage but because it’s prudent to look at it and say, okay, do we have enough of these in our stockpiles for all of our obligations around the world – both in defense of our bases in the Middle East but also our obligations to our Indo-Pacific partners and any other contingencies that might arise.

But in the end, I would say that the overwhelming majority of defense – of military aid that the United States provides Ukraine has never been paused and continues along the same schedules that it’s been.

I think there’s a broader issue unrelated to the pause, and that involves the defense productive capabilities of the West, not just us but of Europe.  As an example, one of the things that the Ukrainians need is more Patriot batteries.  There are Patriot batteries available in multiple countries in Europe, yet no one wants to part with them.  So, I hope that will change.  If, in fact, Ukraine is the priority that so many in countries – so many countries in Europe say it is, they should be willing to share batteries that right now they don’t have a need to use.

So, hopefully, we’ll be able to convince some of our NATO partners to provide those Patriot batteries to Ukraine, because there are a number of countries that have them, but no one wants to part with what they have, so perhaps that’ll change.  That’s important.

QUESTION:  Mr. Secretary, you mentioned wanting to see a roadmap for how this conflict can conclude.  What concrete ideas have been presented, and how did Russia respond in this meeting?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, I – again, these things are best negotiated – I don’t want to – in private, and that’s how these things generally work.  There were some ideas exchanged today, some viewpoints that they expressed to us that I’ll take back to the President for his consideration, and hopefully it will lead to something.  I don’t want to over-promise something.  Again, as I said, this is a conflict that’s been going on now for three – over three years, and as has already been pointed out by one of the questions here, we’ve seen an acceleration of attacks.  I think it’s the – probably the largest drone attack in a city close to the Polish border, actually.  So, it’s a pretty deep strike.

And again, I mean, it’s – every time you see this in the headlines and people die, it reminds you of why the President wants this war to end.  As he has said from the beginning, his number one interest here is to stop people from dying and the destruction that’s ongoing every single day.  They’re going to be having a conference – maybe it starts today, if I’m not mistaken – about reconstruction and the rebuilding of Ukraine.  Every time one of these strikes is launched, the price of reconstruction goes up, right?  There’s also the destruction of the country’s capabilities, the country’s economic capabilities, that has to be added to this.

But obviously the loss of life is something of grave interest – of great interest to the President.  It’s important to note that since January of this year, as an example just to give you, on the Russian side, they’ve lost 100,000 soldiers – dead – not injured – dead.  And on the Ukrainian side, the numbers are less but still very significant.  And so that’s – the President doesn’t like wars.  He thinks wars are a waste of money and a waste of lives, and he wants them to end.  And he’s going to do everything he can within his power to end this war and any other war he has a chance to end, as you’ve seen in the past.

And so, we’re going to continue to work at it.  We understand that these things take time and patience, but obviously we’re also frustrated that more progress has not been made.  And hopefully, based on today and in the days to come, we’ll have more clarity about what exactly the Russian position and priorities are in this regard, and can begin to make some progress.  But it’s been difficult, as you’ve seen.

QUESTION:  May I ask an ASEAN question?

QUESTION:  China’s been supporting Russia.  Will you meet with your Chinese counterpart here this week to speak with him about —

SECRETARY RUBIO:  I think we’re working on that.  Maybe – maybe we’ll meet, and obviously we’ll talk about it.  I think the Chinese clearly have been supportive of the Russian effort, and I think that generally they’ve been willing to help them as much as they can without getting caught.  But people in Europe and other parts of the world have noticed.  But in the end, this peace, if it’s possible and doable, will happen between Ukraine and Russia, and we are willing to do whatever we can to help bring it to an end.

QUESTION:  Can I ask an ASEAN question?

QUESTION:  These ideas that Russia —

SECRETARY RUBIO:  A what?

QUESTION:  An ASEAN question?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Yeah, of course.  That’s why we’re here, right?

QUESTION:  Can I ask you one more quick question on Russia?  Just these ideas that were put on the table today, would you characterize them as new ideas from the Russian side that the Trump Administration had not heard before?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Yes.  Well, I think maybe – yes, I think it’s a new and a different approach.  Again, I wouldn’t characterize it as something that guarantees a peace, but it’s a concept that we’ll – I’ll take back to the President today and – here as soon as I finish with you.

QUESTION:  I just wanted to know – what was your sense today after your meeting, the PMC meeting with the ASEAN foreign ministers, about how big an irritant tariffs are to U.S. relations, both with ASEAN as a bloc but individual countries?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, I think – look, there are two things to understand.  Number one is these letters that are going out and these trade changes, they’re happening with every country in the world – I mean, basically every country in the world.  The President’s been very clear, and he has been – frankly, if you go back to videos of him speaking in the ’80s about his feeling that the state of global trade is unfair to the United States, that for far too long we allowed these imbalances to develop.  We are the world’s largest consumer.  We’re a huge market, where people export things to us, and these huge and unsustainable imbalances have developed with countries all over the world.

And so, this is a globalized effort to reset U.S. trade in a way that’s beneficial to the United States, and not just in dollars and cents but also in our own domestic industrial capacity.  So, this has been made clear to countries around the world.  We were coming up upon June – about the middle of this month, and the markets demand certainty, and so these letters set a baseline.

Now, obviously that does not foreclose the opportunity for individual countries to enter into negotiations that perhaps can adjust those numbers.  But in the end, the President still remains very committed to a rebalancing of trade that’s fair to America and also, at the same time, protects our own industrial capabilities.

QUESTION:  Right.  But you’re here today meeting with ASEAN countries, and those countries, almost all of them, got letters.  So, I’m just wondering —

SECRETARY RUBIO:  But anywhere in the world – well —

QUESTION:  I understand that, but —

SECRETARY RUBIO:  My point to you is anywhere in the world I would have traveled this week, they got a letter.  So, everybody got a letter, and in some cases, some of these countries got a letter where their tariff rate is lower than some of their neighbors or maybe a country somewhere else in the world that might even serve as an advantage.  But of course, it’s raised. It’s an issue, but I wouldn’t say it solely defines our relationship with many of these countries.  There are a lot of other issues that we work together on, and I think there was great enthusiasm that we were here and that we’re a part of this.  A reminder that next week, we’ll have another high-ranking delegation, including Secretary Lutnick.  Deputy Landau from the Department of State will be traveling to Japan for the World Expo there, and they’ll be involved in talks there as well.

You know my very first meeting – I don’t know if you know this, but when I was sworn in I went to the State Department, I gave a speech on the steps, and then my first meeting right out of the box was with Japan, South Korea, and India.  And we’ve repeated that meeting numerous times since then with that group (inaudible).  We have a running internal joke with my counterpart from Japan:  I have literally now seen him about 8 to 12 times, and our joke is that we see each other more than we see our own – our own families.

And so, these engagements are very important to us.  And we’re going to continue to stay very committed, because this – as I said to all of our partners, this notion or idea that the United States would ever be distracted by the Indo-Pacific or even Southeast Asia is impossible.  You can’t be – maybe it doesn’t always – wars get more attention, but it’s impossible to not be focused.  This is where much of the story of the 21st century is going to be written.  This is where two thirds of economic growth is going to happen over the next 25 or 30 years.

And many of the countries of Southeast Asia – not only are they some of the youngest countries in the world, but they’re about to see an enormous expansion of their labor markets, their labor pool, number of workers.  This is a historic, once-in-a-generation opportunity not just for these countries to revolutionize themselves from an economic standpoint, but further strengthen our relationship.  We have over 6,000 American companies that have invested heavily in these economies over the last 20 or 30 years.  These are – we’re not abandoning those relationships.  On the contrary, we want to strengthen and build upon them.

And there are a bunch of other issues.  And certainly, trade is part of it, but there are a lot of other issues that we work together on, and we continue to highly prioritize that.  The story of the 21st century will be written in the Indo-Pacific.  And the countries represented here today, along with others that have joined to be a part of this, represent some of the – not just important markets, some of the most important partners we have in the world.

QUESTION:  Secretary Rubio —

MODERATOR:  Last question.

QUESTION:  This is obviously a very quick trip.  Do you intend to come back to Asia or to Southeast Asia —

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Sure.

QUESTION:  — maybe on a longer trip sometime in the future, near future?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Sure, absolutely.  This was a great trip because we got to see 12, 13, 14, 15 countries that are all here.  So, these forums – there’ll be a leaders forum here in October, which we look forward to being a part of it.  We’ve also engaged with many of our colleagues here at different forums – many of them, for example, not just at the G7 foreign ministers, they also attended on the sidelines of NATO at the foreign minister level and also at the leaders level.  So, we’ll continue to engage with the region, both in Washington and other places around the world, and in our return travel here.  And so, we’ll be back.

In addition – and it’s not just me.  The Secretary of Defense has been out here, the Deputy Secretary of State will be here next week.  So, we’ll look for other – obviously, the leaders forum will be here in October as well.  So, we’ll be here, we’ll be engaged, as we do every single day.

MODERATOR:  (Inaudible).

QUESTION:  Secretary, there’s a review right now by the administration of the AUKUS deal that the last administration forged, and I think that raises some question among Asian-Pacific allies and partners about the U.S. defense commitment here in Asia.  What do you say to people who are —

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Yeah.  Well, look, anytime a new administration takes over, there’s a review of all policies.  I mean, policies are reviewed; doesn’t necessarily mean you’re against it.  We did a review at the State Department of our diplomatic presence around the world, because I wanted to know which consulates and embassies could be adjusted both in their size and in their presence, could we consolidate their presence.  We did a review; we haven’t closed any embassies.  But we did a review.  So just because you’re reviewing something doesn’t mean you’re going to necessarily act on it.  It means you’re a new administration, and you want to take an audit, an account, about all the policies that you’ve inherited – and policies, how they’ve changed since the last time you were in office when it comes to the Trump administration.

So – but our policies on AUKUS have not changed.

MODERATOR:  Thank you.

SECRETARY RUBIO:  What else?

QUESTION:  Are you hopeful on a Gaza ceasefire in the next few days?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, we’re hopeful.  I mean, in the end, we’re hoping they’ll move to proximity talks.  It appears that generally the terms have been agreed to, but obviously now you need to have talks about you implement those terms.  And I spoke to Steve Witkoff last night, and he’s optimistic that proximity talks will begin fairly soon, expedited and facilitated by the Qataris and the Egyptians.  And so – but we’ve seen talks fall apart in the past at that stage of proximity talks.

So, I think we’re closer, and I think perhaps we’re closer than we’ve been in quite a while, and we’re hopeful.  But we also recognize there are still some challenges in the way, and one of the fundamental challenges is Hamas’s unwillingness to disarm, which would end this conflict immediately.  If they just released the hostages – there shouldn’t be a single hostage.  There shouldn’t be a single hostage body still left.  If they released that and disarmed, this would end.

But that said, the Israelis have shown some flexibility here, and so I think we’ve – we’ve seen progress made.  So, we’re hopeful, but we also understand that these things are – have been difficult for a reason.  But we are – we’re hopeful that they can move to proximity talks pretty quickly and go from there, and have a ceasefire in place in the near future.

QUESTION:  Are there any sticking points from the Israeli side, such as on aid or the withdrawal of Israeli troops?  Where does that stand?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, the sticking point would be on the Hamas side.  I mean, Hamas – they should want Israel to withdraw completely and allow them to go back to being Hamas.  Obviously, the Israelis aren’t going to agree to that.

I think the easiest way to end this – that’s not what the agreement is, but the easiest way to end this is for all the hostages to be released and for Hamas to disarm.  Absent that, the Israelis and Hamas, through the intermediation – in the intermediation of Qatar and Egypt, have reached an understanding: a 60-day ceasefire, and some elements of that with regards to humanitarian aid through international agencies resuming, and so forth.  But now you’ve got to have talks about how you implement that.  And that’s where this has fallen apart in the past.  We’re hopeful that’ll work out.  We’re doing everything we can.  We’d like to see a ceasefire.  The President’s been clear he wants to see a ceasefire, and we’ve invested a lot of time and energy.  I know Steve Witkoff works every – hours every single day on this topic alone.  So, we’ve invested a lot of time into that.  We’d like to see it happen.

Okay?

QUESTION:  The AI impersonator of you, anything you can say about who is behind that?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  No – no, I mean, anybody – it could happen to anybody and every – especially if you’re a public figure, there’s got to be – like, they could take the interview I did here today and change it around, so – but as soon as I found out about it last week, I referred it to the FBI, Diplomatic Security, and others.  It won’t be the last time you see me or others, for that matter – maybe some of you will be impersonated, but it’s just a reality of this AI technology that’s going on, and it’s a real threat.  But —

QUESTION:  How did you find out?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Oh, somebody called me – the senator that called me and said, “Hey, did you just try to reach me?” and actually sent me a voice recording – it didn’t sound – I don’t think it really sounded like me.  Maybe he fell for that call, but – but maybe there was a better one that I didn’t see.

QUESTION:  It was on Signal, right?  So does this —

SECRETARY RUBIO:  I don’t know how they got it or if it was a voicemail.  No, it doesn’t matter what form you use.  I mean, it doesn’t matter if it’s Signal or anything else.

QUESTION:  But there are more secure methods, though.  On Signal, you can create an account with an email address, and that is one of the reasons that they were able to reach out to people and then use the voicemail messages to imitate your voice.

SECRETARY RUBIO:  I’ve had people in the past ask me if I texted – like, within days of becoming Secretary of State, I had foreign ministers calling the State Department asking if I had just texted them.  So, I don’t know, guys.  This is just the reality of the 21st century with AI and fake stuff that’s going on.  It’s – generally I communicate with my counterparts around the world through official channels for a reason, and that’s to avoid this.  So —

QUESTION:  Do you have any sense of who the perpetrator is?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  No.  I mean, the perpetrator is somebody with an AI software.  That could be anybody in the world.  My sense is the target really isn’t me.  The target is the people they’re reaching out to, to try to trick them into a call or whatever.  And who knows what they do with it?  But you’re going to hear about this for a long time, and not just me.  It’ll happen to other people, because all you need is a recording of someone’s voice and you can come up with it.  So yeah, it’s just one of the other great challenges posed to us by AI.  I’m sure there’s a lot of positive aspects to AI as well, but this ain’t one of them.

QUESTION:  You said, Secretary, that the weapons pause by the Pentagon, in the narrow scope in which it occurred, made sense.  But was it a decision on which the State Department was consulted, or what was the level of —

SECRETARY RUBIO:  No, it wasn’t a – I know, I said it was a review, a pause pending a review.  And so, you – we’re constantly – the Pentagon is constantly reviewing stockpiles, especially after an engagement such as the one we had in the Middle East.  So, my point is that there wasn’t a policy decision not to give weapons to Ukraine.  It was a review in which certain munitions were temporarily paused for that review and for that purpose.  And this reporting out there that there was no awareness of it is not true.  Now – but no policy decision was made, in essence.  No one ever said we’re not sending weapons to Ukraine.  That’s been appropriated by Congress, and that’s continued, and that continues to this very day.

But when you’re doing a review, there’s some period of time in which during that review, it’s possible that some shipping is slowed down – not stopped, but because it’s being reviewed, someone would say, okay, well, let’s not send it today, let’s wait a couple days because we’re conducting a review of that particular munition.  So that’s what happened here, and I think it was not appropriately reported, initially.  But nonetheless, it’s pretty clear now that review has occurred.  And as the President’s made clear, there has been no change to our posture with regards to providing what we have available.

Now, I would remind everybody – again, I go back to the point I made, and that is that there are certain things that Ukraine needs like Patriot batteries.  Those are available.  There are multiple countries in Europe that possess Patriot batteries that they could share with Ukraine, and we’re actively talking to countries about doing that.

QUESTION:  Anyone specifically?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, the Spaniards have them.  They’re really far from Ukraine and they have one.  The Germans have, others have them – I’m not singling them out, but I’m just telling you those are two that I know.  There are other Patriot batteries, and there are other opportunities.  Countries that have ordered Patriot batteries that are about to receive shipments of them, it’d be great if one of them volunteered to defer that shipment and send it to Ukraine instead.  So, we’re looking for creative ways to provide them these defensive weapons that they would need.

Now, that’s not going to help them with the drone attacks.  That’s a very different technique that we use in order to bring those down.  But it would help them with some of these missile attacks that we’re seeing.  Again, these are defensive weapons.

QUESTION:  The reduction in force of the State Department, is that something that we should expect to happen while you are traveling, or is it something you want to be in Washington, D.C. while it happens?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  No, I mean, we’ve already notified that to Congress.  Understand our reduction in force was done – I’m very proud to say, I think, I would argue, probably in the most deliberate way of anyone that’s done one.  We went very specifically through and reorganized the State Department.  And when you reorganize the State Department, there were certain bureaus we wanted to empower, the regional bureaus, and there were certain bureaus, these functional bureaus, that were closed.  And so, it made sense to – so that’s been notified to Congress and to the workforce for some period of time.  And so, we’ve been ready to implement it pending a court decision, which now has been reached.

There’s some timing associated with how you do that, how you actually implement it, but our intent is to move forward with the plans that we’ve notified Congress of weeks ago and that we took months to design.

QUESTION:  Will the numbers be the same as what was notified to Congress?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Sure.  I mean, our plan that we notified to Congress is what we intend to do, and then we’ll have (inaudible) our – again, the reduction of force is a consequence of the reorg.  It’s not a consequence of getting – trying to get rid of people.  But if you close the bureau, you don’t need those positions.  Understand that some of these are positions that are being eliminated, not people.  Some of them are unfilled positions for potential – or positions that someone took early retirement, and therefore are now – or about to be unfilled.

So – but we took a very deliberate step to reorganize the State Department to be more efficient and more focused.  That’s been publicly noticed to Congress months ago; we’ve been prepared to implement it.  And the thing that slowed us down was a court decision by a district judge in the northern district of California.  The Supreme Court has ruled on that, and so we’re prepared to act on it.  It’ll come as no surprise, and that is our reorg.  That’ll be the extent of what we intend to do, and we’re already operating under the new organizational structure as-is for the most part.  So, this will further enhance that.

Okay?  Thank you.

QUESTION:  Thank you.
