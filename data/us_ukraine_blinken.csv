The following is attributable to Spokesperson Ned Price:

Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III visited Kyiv, Ukraine yesterday to demonstrate the United States’ unwavering commitment to Ukraine and the Ukrainian people in their struggle against Russian aggression.

While in Kyiv, Secretary Blinken and Secretary Austin met with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, Minister of Defense Oleksiy Reznikov, Head of Presidential Administration Andriy Yermak, Chief of Defense General Valeriy Zaluzhny, and Ambassador Oksana Markarova. They discussed America’s stalwart support for the Ukrainian government and Ukrainian people, including through our significant assistance to Ukraine’s security, governance, economic, and humanitarian needs. Secretary Blinken also voiced renewed support for Ukraine’s efforts to end the Russian aggression through diplomacy and dialogue, noting that our continued support will strengthen Ukraine’s hand on the battlefield and at the negotiating table.

During their meeting, Secretary Blinken shared that President Biden will nominate Bridget Brink, currently the U.S. Ambassador to Slovakia, to be the next U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine. If confirmed, Ambassador Brink will lead our diplomatic mission in Ukraine with dedication and distinction. She previously served as Senior Advisor and Deputy Assistant Secretary in the Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs and as the Deputy Chief of Mission at the U.S. Embassies in Tashkent, Uzbekistan and Tbilisi, Georgia. Her decades of experience make her uniquely suited for this moment in Ukraine’s history.

Underscoring our intensive diplomatic engagement, Secretary Blinken also relayed that U.S. diplomats will be returning to Ukraine this week. The increased U.S. presence demonstrates our support for Ukraine and is part of the U.S. commitment to return our diplomats to our Embassy in Kyiv as soon as possible. This action will strengthen the Department’s ongoing commitment to facilitate humanitarian relief efforts and the delivery of assistance to the Government of Ukraine, while providing enhanced support to U.S. citizens.

Secretary Blinken informed President Zelenskyy that the United States intends to obligate more than $713 million in Foreign Military Financing (FMF) for Ukraine and 15 other Allied and partner nations in Central and Eastern Europe and the Balkan region. This includes $650 million in funding provided by the Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2022. More than $322 million in this obligation is for Ukraine and will provide support for the capabilities Ukraine needs as Russia’s forces train their focus on the Donbas; this assistance will also help Ukraine’s armed forces transition to more advanced weapons and air defense systems. This assistance will also help NATO Allies with backfilling capabilities they have donated to Ukraine from their own stockpiles. Additionally, Secretary Blinken told President Zelenskyy that on April 24 the Department notified Congress of a Foreign Military Sale of up to $165 million for non-standard ammunition for Ukraine. Since the start of Russia’s renewed invasion of Ukraine on February 24, the United States has committed roughly $3.7 billion in security assistance and has provided more than $4.3 billion since the start of the Biden Administration.

As part of our continuing assistance, Secretary Austin also informed the Government of Ukraine that the U.S. Department of Defense will expand military training for Ukrainian service members in the region on certain weapons systems being provided. He highlighted U.S. efforts to accelerate the delivery of these weapons, which are now arriving within days of announcement. And he underscored that, along with our Allies and partners, the United States will continue to coordinate the shipment of additional heavy weaponry, ammunition and spare parts from other nations. Secretary Austin also previewed for Ukrainian leaders the agenda for this week’s Defense Consultative Meeting in Germany. Convened by the United States, the Consultative Meeting will examine the operational picture on the ground and review near-term Ukrainian defense needs, while providing attendees an opportunity to examine ways in which Ukraine’s longer term national security interests can be best met.

Both Secretary Blinken and Secretary Austin shared their admiration for the everyday heroism exhibited by the Ukrainian people – whether the soldier on the frontlines, those who are ministering the wounded, sick, or vulnerable or the defiant grandmothers resisting Russian aggression. They noted that the bravery of Ukrainians in defending freedom and democracy inspires us all and underscored our confidence that an even stronger Ukraine will emerge from this conflict.

Remarks

Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State

NATO Headquarters

Brussels, Belgium

September 9, 2022

MODERATOR:  Good afternoon. The Secretary General and the Secretary of State will make introductory remarks, and then they’ll be happy to take a few questions.  Secretary General.

SECRETARY GENERAL STOLTENBERG:  Secretary Blinken, dear Tony, welcome back to NATO.  It’s always great to see you here and thank you for your personal leadership and your personal commitment to our transatlantic Alliance.

Today, the NATO flag and the flags of 30 allies are at half mast to honor Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.  She was a strong supporter of our transatlantic Alliance, of our armed forces, and our values.  She knew and worked with all NATO secretaries general, since the founding of NATO.  She visited NATO headquarters and hosted NATO leaders at Buckingham Palace.  I’ll always remember her wisdom, her warmth, and her strong personal interest in transatlantic security.  Our heartfelt condolences to King Charles III, the royal family, and the people of our allies, the United Kingdom and Canada.

We have just concluded a meeting of the North Atlantic Council, where we addressed NATO’s strong and united response to Russia’s brutal war on Ukraine.  This includes unprecedented military, financial, and humanitarian aid from allies so that Ukraine can uphold its right to self‑defense.  The United States is leading the way, and I welcome the billions of dollars of additional support announced this week.

Yesterday, I participated in the U.S.-led Ukraine Defense Contact Group in Russia.  We all agree on the importance of stepping and sustaining our winter support so that Ukraine prevails as an independent sovereign state.

In June, NATO leaders agreed a strengthened package of assistance with fuel, food, medical supplies, military gear, secure communications, and equipment to encounter mines and drones.  We will support Ukraine in the long term and help its transition from Soviet-era to modern NATO equipment.

The war in Ukraine is entering a critical phase.  Ukrainian forces have been able to stall Moscow’s offensive in Donbas, strike back behind Russian lines, and retake territory.  Just in the last few days, we have seen further progress – both in the south in Kherson, and in the east in the Kharkiv region.  This shows the bravery, skills, and determination of Ukrainian forces, and it shows that our support is making a difference every day on the battlefield.

In the coming months our unity and sovereignty will be tested with pressure on energy supplies and the soaring cost of living, caused by Russia’s war.  But the price we pay is measured in money, while the price Ukrainians are paying is measured in lives – lost lives every day.  And all of us will pay a much higher price, if Russia and all the authoritarian regimes see that their aggression is rewarded.

If Russia stops fighting, there will be peace.  If Ukraine stops fighting, it will cease to exist as an independent nation.  So we must stay the course for Ukraine’s sake and for ours.  At the same time, we are sending an unmistakable message to Moscow about our readiness to protect and defend every inch of our territory.  We are significantly enhancing our presence in the east of the Alliance, putting hundreds of thousands of troops on high readiness, supported with significant air and naval forces, and continuing to invest in cutting-edge capabilities.

All of this makes clear that our commitment to Article 5 is unshakeable.  Europe and North American must continue to stand together in NATO, in defense of our people, our nations, and our values.

So Secretary Blinken, dear Tony, thank you again for leadership, for being here, and for a strong personal commitment to our Alliance.  Please, start, of course.

SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Jens, thank you so much.  Thank you especially for your remarkable leadership of our Alliance in what is the decisive period of the Alliance.  We’ve come out of the NATO Summit with a new Strategic Concept.  We’ve faced Russian aggression in Ukraine.  We’ve done it together, and that’s in no small measure because of your leadership.

Before speaking about what brings me here today, I’d like to join Jens in taking a moment just to honor the truly extraordinary life of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.  On her 21st birthday, then Princess Elizabeth committed to dedicating her life to serving the people of the Commonwealth.  For more than 70 years – a period during which the United Kingdom and world witnessed unprecedented change – the Queen did just that, while personifying a sense of stability and continuity in turbulent times.  She was a powerful, unifying force, a source of comfort and resilience to millions of people from all walks of life.  On behalf of the United States, I extend our deepest condolences to our British friends, to the Government of the United Kingdom, to the royal family.

So as Jens noted, we just finished a session with our NATO Allies, where I had an opportunity to share a readout of my talks in Kyiv with President Zelenskyy, Foreign Minister Kuleba, and other senior Ukrainian officials.  I’ll have an opportunity to speak to President von der Leyen from the European Union tomorrow to continue the strong transatlantic cooperation that we’ve had on Ukraine and on so many other things.  These consultations are just the latest example of the unity and strength of our Alliance.

Yesterday, as I was in Kyiv, Secretary of Defense Austin convened the fifth meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, at Ramstein Air Base in Germany.  More than 50 countries took part, including Ukraine’s defense minister as well as the Secretary General.  Support from that group continues to make a decisive difference on the battlefield, where Ukraine’s great defenders are not just holding ground, they are retaking their sovereign territory in a two-front counteroffensive.

As I told President Zelenskyy, the support of the United States is unwavering.  I announced more than $2.8 billion in additional security assistance to Ukraine and also for its neighbors.  That support includes $675 million in new military aid to Ukraine.  This is part of the twentieth drawdown of military equipment that President Biden has initiated, going back before the Russian aggression.  It includes more guided multiple launch rocket systems, artillery ammunition, high-speed anti-radiation missiles, anti-tank systems.  The twentieth drawdown now totals $14.7 billion.

That sum also includes approximately $2.2 billion in what we call foreign military financing for Ukraine, but also for European allies and partners.  That will allow them to begin to begin to acquire assistance for the medium and long term that will be essential to deterring and, if necessary, defending against further Russian aggression in the years to come.

Our unity here at NATO, across our alliances and partnerships at the United Nations and other international institutions, is essential to advancing our objectives – shared objectives of supporting Ukraine’s capacity to defend itself, sustaining pressure on Russia for its aggression, ensuring that Ukraine is in the strongest position when conditions are ripe for negotiations.  As President Zelenskyy has said, and rightly said, diplomacy is the only way to definitively end Russia’s war of aggression.  We see in this moment no indication from Russia that it would be prepared to seriously pursue such diplomacy, but if and when that time comes, Ukraine has to be in the strongest possible position.

Now, President Putin thought that he would divide and weaken NATO.  Today, the Alliance is stronger, more unified, better resourced than ever before, and I heard further evidence in our session with NATO partners today.  We’ll soon welcome Finland and Sweden as new allies. We’ve approved a new Strategic Concept to meet twenty-first century threats, and more allies are meeting their pledge to spend two percent of their GDP on defense.

President Putin thought that he would divide the Ukrainian people and swiftly absorb their nation into Russia, but the Kremlin’s efforts to impose its will by force on Ukraine have only further united its people around the goal of defending their sovereignty and preserving a free and open democracy.

President Putin thought his invasion would showcase the Russian military’s might and sophistication.  Instead, the Russian army is turning to North Korea and Iran for badly needed supplies, while Ukraine’s military capability continues to get stronger, thanks to its leadership, thanks to the courage of its fighters, and thanks to the robust support from allies and partners.

President Putin thought that our willingness to apply economic pressure would fade with time.  Instead, we and our partners and allies have stuck together in the face of Moscow’s coercion and threats, imposing unprecedented costs on Russia’s economy.  To date, over 1,000 foreign companies have quit the Russian market.  Export controls on semiconductors and other advanced technologies mean that Russia cannot sustain – never mind modernize – key sectors, from automobile manufacturing to military exports, to energy exploration.

Russian imports parts and finished products, have been cut in half from a year ago.  What does that mean?  It means that they can’t replace the weapons that they’re using up in Ukraine, that they can’t make products for their domestic market, that their people are accustomed to buy.  They can’t produce things for export, which will shrink their foreign markets.

Half a million people – half a million people, many of them highly skilled workers – have left the country.  Russia’s foreign exchange reserves are estimated to have fallen by $75 billion and an additional $300 billion are currently frozen abroad.  Meanwhile, Russia is cut off from the international lending market.

All of this is building.  It’s cumulative.  It will get to be a heavier and heavier burden, as long as Russia’s aggression continues.

And yet, even as President Putin has failed in virtually all of his objectives, the human suffering he’s inflicted on Ukrainians and other people around the world is staggering.  I saw some of those consequences up close on my visit yesterday in Ukraine, including to Irpin, whose very name, like the battle of Bucha and Mariupol has become synonymous with Russian war crimes, including indiscriminate violence and the intentional targeting of civilians.

I saw the costs in my visit to the children’s hospital in Kyiv, where I met kids who will spend the rest of their lives without limbs, with enduring brain injuries, or with other trauma that may be invisible to the eye, because of atrocities committed by Russian forces.  Hundreds more Ukrainian boys and girls have been killed by this unprovoked war.

It’s not just Ukrainians who are bearing the costs.  As Russia falls short of its battlefield aims and is increasingly isolated on the global stage, President Putin has turned to blunter tools to try to peel off support from Ukraine.  He’s weaponized energy against European countries standing up to his aggression, raising the costs on families, on businesses, on entire nations.

President Putin is betting that these actions will break the will of countries to stand with Ukraine.  He’s betting that the Kremlin can bully other countries into submission.  He’s already lost that bet, because the last six and a half months show a growing recognition around the world that while the costs of standing up to the Kremlin’s aggression are high, the costs of standing down would be even higher.

That’s why the United States is doing everything in its power to support people around the world who are shouldering the greatest cost of Russia’s aggression, like our comprehensive efforts to help Europeans get though a winter during which they’ll face heavy energy costs, making it hard for many to heat their homes.  We won’t leave our European friends out in the cold.

It’s also an opportunity to make a decisive shift finally – once and for all – away from dependence on Russian energy, which Putin will never stop trying to weaponize to Europe’s detriment; and to make the transition to renewable sources, necessary as well to combat the climate crisis.  We can – we will – emerge stronger and in a better place.

And that’s why it’s so vital that we stay the course, that we stay united – united in support of Ukraine, united with our allies and partners, united for as long as it takes.  Thank you.

MODERATOR:  We’ll take questions now.  I see Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (inaudible).

QUESTION:  Thanks a lot.  Thomas Gutschker, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.  My question to you, Secretary Blinken:  We’ve seen this astonishing move of Ukrainian forces in the northeast of their country, pushing possibly 50 kilometers into Russian occupied territory.  How do you explain that?  It appears that the Russian army is hardly even fighting.  Is that – is it on the brink of collapse in that area.  Do you have an explanation for that?  And do you see this potentially as a turning point in this war?

And the question to the Secretary General, if I may:  You are constantly making the case for member states to send more ammunition, more arms to Ukraine.  One of the replies we are constantly hearing from our defense ministers is that it will compromise capacities that they have pledged to NATO.  So, when push comes to shove, and member states do have to make a decision on either supporting Ukraine or holding up their commitments to NATO, what is your suggestion?  What’s the right decision to take?

SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Yeah, so happy to start.  Thank you.  Let me say two things.  First, what we’re seeing is that the counteroffensive that the Ukrainians have put in place with strong systems and backing from many countries is now underway.  It’s early days, but it is demonstrably making real progress.  It’s focused in the south, around Kherson, in that area.  But we’re also seeing Ukraine not only hold the line in the Donbas and in the northeast, but as you noted, make a significant advance moving some 45 to 50 kilometers in one area past what had been the existing Russia line.

I think it’s too early to say exactly where this will go, when it will get there, and exactly where it will end up.  But I think we can say that Ukraine is proceeding in a very deliberate way with a strong plan, and critically enabled by resources that many of us are providing.

But fundamentally – and I think this may explain more directly the answer to your question – why am I absolutely confident in the success of the Ukrainians in pushing back the Russian aggression, whether it’s in the northeast, the Donbas, or in the south?  For one simple basic reason:  This is Ukraine’s homeland, not Russia.  People are fighting for their homeland; they’re fighting for their future.  And while we can calculate the benefits of weapon systems and financial resources, it’s hard to put a value on that determination to fight for one’s own country, except to say that it’s invaluable and the single biggest difference maker that I think we’ll see play out over the weeks and months ahead.

SECRETARY GENERAL STOLTENBERG:  NATO has had provided unprecedented support to Ukraine with the weapons, with the ammunition and other capabilities.  And of course, they have done that bolstered by reducing existing stocks.  And you are right that, of course, our allies are now raising the issue of whether these stocks are depleted too much.

My answer to that is actually twofold.  One is to realize that weapons, ammunitions that we are providing to Ukraine are used to stop the aggressive actions of Russia against an independent, sovereign nation in Europe which is a close partner of NATO.  And if President Putin wins in Ukraine, it’s not only bad for Ukrainians, but it is also dangerous for all of us.  So actually, by ensuring that Russia, that President Putin doesn’t win in Ukraine, we’re also increasing our own security and strengthening the Alliance by proving that we don’t allow that kind of behavior close to our own borders.  So, the use of these stocks actually helps to increase our own security and reduce the risk of any aggressive actions by Russia against NATO Ally countries.

Let me also add that more than 80 percent of Russia’s land forces are now dedicated to the war in Ukraine.  So for what happens there, not just for the total capacity of Russia to pose any threat to any NATO Ally from here.

So, my first message to the Allies is that we welcome the unprecedented support.  We are calling for even more support, and we urge them to dig deeply into the inventories, to the stocks, to continue to provide the supplies that Ukraine need immediately.  And we see that this is making a huge difference on the ground, because as Secretary Blinken – Tony – just referred to, there are – we see progress on the ground in Ukraine.  But make no mistakes, you have to be prepared for the long haul.

The second answer to the concern about the level of stocks is of course to produce more.  Therefore we are now in close contact with the defense industry, with capitals.  We have established structures here at NATO on defense planning, on capabilities, to ensure that we are now ramping up production, that we are replenishing the stocks, both to be able to continue to provide support to Ukraine, but this is not only about supporting Ukraine; it’s also about ensuring that we have the weapons, the munitions, the capabilities in place for our own deterrence and defense.

MODERATOR:  Okay, with Agence France-Presse.

QUESTION:  Thank you, Mr. Secretary.  Thank you, Mr. Secretary General.  Can I follow up on my colleague’s question a bit on the state of where it is?  Russia has just announced that they’re sending reinforcements into the Kharkiv area.  How do you see this going?  Do you think this is a sign of – how do you see this as a sign in terms of the direction that Russia’s going in?  And how do you see this as a – in terms of where it could be seen in Kharkiv?

Could I ask you also, since you’re talking about the Alliance and unity among the – within the Alliance, the question of Turkey.  Turkey, there was some concerns raised previously on Sweden and Finland.  This past weekend there were comments from President Erdoğan regarding Greece and comments perceived as threatening.  How do you see the role of Turkey in this?  Do you have any specific reaction to President Erdoğan’s remarks this weekend?  Thank you.

SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Shaun, thank you.  On the first question, following up on our German colleague, look, the counteroffensive, again, is in its early days, so I don’t want to prejudge, as I said, where it will go and how far it will get.  But the initial signs are positive, and we see Ukraine making real, demonstrable progress in a deliberate way.

But fundamentally, what we’re also seeing – and we’ve seen this throughout – even as President Putin threw as much as he could against Ukraine earlier this summer, Ukraine absorbed the blow and now is pushing back, enabled by our partners and allies, the United States.

But the single most important factor, I believe, is this: Ukrainians are fighting for their own country.  The Russian forces in Ukraine, many of them have no idea why they’re there.  Some didn’t even know where they were being sent.  We see reports that their morale is low, and when you don’t know what you’re fighting for, that is something that’s not sustainable.

Now, Russia has significant resources, military resources.  It is acting in horrific, indiscriminate ways.  Ukrainians are bearing an incredibly heavy cost, as Jens alluded to.  Their lives are on the line.  And even on the front lines now, in and around the Kherson area – even as they’re making progress, they’re bearing real costs.  But fundamentally they are fighting for their own homeland, they’re fighting for their future; the Russian forces in Ukraine are not.  And I am convinced that that is the most decisive factor, and we’re seeing some manifestations of that.  But this is likely to go on for some significant period of time.  There are a huge number of Russian forces that are in Ukraine, and unfortunately, tragically, horrifically, President Putin has demonstrated that he will throw a lot of people into this, at huge cost to Russia, at huge cost to its future.

And let me just add something I’ve said from the beginning.  How is what Putin is doing doing anything to improve the lives of the Russian people?  How is this helping them?  How is this assuring their own future?  How is this creating opportunity for them?  Not only is it not; it’s doing just the opposite.  It’s cutting Russia off from the world.  It’s denying opportunity.  It’s depleting its resources, resources that could go to help the Russian people.  In a closed information society that Putin has created in Russia, that information doesn’t get there as quickly as it otherwise might, but I believe it will.  And Russians have to ask themselves why in the world they are losing so many lives trying to take another country that is not theirs.

SECRETARY GENERAL STOLTENBERG:  Just briefly on that, yes, we see some encouraging signs.  The Russian offensive in Donbas has been stalled by the Ukrainian forces, and they are retaking some territory both in the east and in the south.  But make no mistake.  This can last for long time, and at least we have to be prepared for long haul and be ready to provide support to Ukraine for as long as it takes.

Wars are, by nature, unpredictable; and we know that Russia has a lot of military capabilities, and they are willing to use them to attack a sovereign, independent democratic nation, as we are seeing over the last months in Ukraine.

The first task is actually to be prepared for the winter.  The winter is coming, it’s going to be hard, and therefore we need both to continue to supply weapons and ammunition, but also winter clothing, tents, generators, and all the specific equipment which is needed for the winter.  Partly because the size of the Ukraine army has just increased so much, they need more of these kind of winter equipment; and NATO is particularly focused on how can we provide tens of thousands of, for instance, winter uniforms to the Ukrainian army.

On Turkey and Greece, Turkey and Greece are two highly valued Allies.  They participate and contribute to NATO in many different ways.  Any differences between them, of course, should be solved by diplomatic means.  We have also at NATO established what we call a deconfliction mechanism where Turkey and Greece can engage and have used this previously to provide information to provide also ways to deconflict any dangerous situation or behavior in, for instance, the Aegean Sea.

MODERATOR:  New York Times.

QUESTION:  Thank you.  I’d like to follow up on Shaun’s – I’d like to follow up on Shaun’s question about Turkey and just press a little bit more.  You talked about the importance of unity to the Alliance.  President Erdoğan in many ways, not only with this recent threat to Greece, seems to be threatening that unity.  He’s talked about another incursion into northeast Syria.  He renewed over the summer his threat to block the admission of Sweden and Finland into the Alliance, and then this latest issue with Greece, among others.  Just can you talk a little bit more about the effect this has on the unity you say is so crucial?

And specifically Secretary Blinken, I believe I heard you say in your introductory remarks that you’re confident or looking forward to Sweden and Finland being admitted into the Alliance.  Can you tell us what your basis for that optimism is given that President Erdoğan, as I said, renewed his threat over the summer to block their admission?

And if I just might briefly ask you to talk a little bit about where things stand with the Iran nuclear negotiations.  They appear to have stalled out, perhaps once and for all.  Can they be revived?  And what comes next?  Thank you.

SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Michael, thank you.  And I’m really going to defer to the secretary general on questions fundamentally related to NATO.  Let me simply say this.

First, with regard to Finland and Sweden, I think it’s very clear that there is a strong Alliance consensus, strong support for their admission.  We’ve seen the ratification of the protocols process move forward with land record speed, and there’s strong support in the United States, of course, from both political parties.  I had the honor of depositing the instruments of ratification last month.  So I’m very confident that this is moving forward, moving forward deliberately, but I would defer to Jens on anything further on that.

More broadly, I can only repeat what Jens said, for example, about Greece and Turkey – both vital, important Allies, friends of the United States.  They have differences, and of course we’d like to see them resolve these differences in a constructive way through dialogue.  They’ve done so in the past, and we would expect them to do so going forward.

And it is precisely because we have a fundamental challenge before us when it comes to Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, a challenge that matters to every single ally and many countries well beyond the Alliance, well beyond the transatlantic area.  And so, we should be making sure that we’re focusing all of our attention and our resources as necessary in supporting Ukraine and pushing back against Russia’s aggression.

Now, what I’ve heard in the room today with all of our NATO partners present was a very strong reaffirmation of that focus, of that unity – unity of purpose, unity of action.  President Biden heard that very clearly in the conversation that he initiated just yesterday with many of our partners.  Secretary Austin heard that and saw that at Ramstein where for the fifth time this coalition of countries has come together to further support Ukraine.  So what I’m seeing as a practical matter is an Alliance that is united and is focused on the biggest challenge that many of our countries face right now.

With regard to Iran and the JCPOA, a few things.  First, it’s a negotiation.  It’s back and forth.  We have a response from Iran to what was put forward most recently by the European Union.  We’ve been looking at that along with the European partners, and needless to say, I’m not about to negotiate anything in public.  In past weeks, we’ve closed some gaps.  Iran had moved away from some extraneous demands, demands unrelated to the JCPOA itself.  However, the latest response takes us backwards, and we are not about to agree to a deal that doesn’t meet our bottom line requirements and/or that tries to continuously introduce extraneous demands that are not relevant to the JCPOA itself.  If we conclude a deal, it’s only because it will advance our national security.  The President is focused on that, and what we’ve just seen again would appear to move us backward, not forward.

SECRETARY GENERAL STOLTENBERG:  On differences in NATO – yes, of course, there are differences in NATO.  We are 30 different Allies, 30 different democracies, and of course we don’t always agree on all issues.  And that has been the case since this Alliance was founded more than 70 years ago, dating back to the Suez Crisis in ’56 or the differences on the Iraq War 20 years ago.  And of course, we also see differences today.  What makes NATO the most successful alliance in history is that we’re able to overcome those differences, and then make decisions together, and then implement them together.

And we saw that demonstrated at the NATO summit in Madrid just a few months ago.  We made big decisions on further increasing our presence in the eastern part of Alliance.  We only had 40,000 troops under NATO command as a direct response to the Russian attack on Ukraine.  And we have also agreed to strengthen deterrence and defense across the whole Alliance.

We made also the decision to invite Finland and Sweden.  That’s an historic decision.  And all Allies agreed to invite them.  And I also welcome that, so far, this has been the fastest accession process in NATO’s modern history.  Up to now, 24 Allies have already ratified, in national parliaments, the accession protocols, and including the U.S. – the United States Senate.

And I also think it’s important to recognize that we have to take the security concerns of all Allies seriously, meaning that we need to address the fact that no other Ally have suffered – has suffered more terrorist attacks than Turkey.  And therefore, I welcome that as part of the agreement in Madrid – it was a trilateral agreement between Finland, Sweden, and Turkey to strengthen cooperation when it comes to fighting terrorism.  They have established a permanent mechanism to exchange more informations, to exchange intelligence, and to work more closely together.

So, I’m confident that we will move forward, and that Finland and Sweden will become members; and so, far this has been the fastest accession protocol process ever in NATO’s history.

MODERATOR:  I know there are more questions; unfortunately, we have run out of time, so this concludes this press conference.  Thank you.

United Nations

New York, N.Y.

February 24, 2023

SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Mr.  President, Mr.  Secretary-General, fellow council members:

One year and one week ago – on February 17th, 2022 – I warned this council that Russia was planning to invade Ukraine.

I said that Russia would manufacture a pretext, and then use missiles, tanks, soldiers, cyber attacks to strike pre-identified targets, including Kyiv, with the aim of toppling Ukraine’s democratically elected government.

Russia’s representative – the same representative who will speak today – called these, and I quote, “groundless accusations.”

Seven days later, on February 24th, 2022, Russia launched its full-scale invasion.

Due to fierce resistance by Ukraine’s defenders, President Putin failed in his primary objective to conquer Ukraine, end its existence as an independent country, and absorb it into Russia.

Then, he dusted off his Crimea playbook from 2014: He called snap referenda in four occupied parts of Ukraine, deported Ukrainians, bussed in Russians, held sham votes at gunpoint, and then manipulated the results to claim near unanimous support for joining the Russian Federation.

When President Putin couldn’t break the Ukrainian military, he intensified efforts to break Ukrainians’ spirit.  Over the last year, Russia has killed tens of thousands of Ukrainian men, women, and children; uprooted more than 13 million people from their homes; destroyed more than half of the country’s energy grid; bombed more than 700 hospitals, 2,600 schools; and abducted at least 6,000 Ukrainian children – some as young as four months old – and relocated them to Russia.

And yet, the spirit of the Ukrainians remains unbroken; if anything, it’s stronger than ever.

When Ukraine launched a counteroffensive that retook large swaths of its territory, President Putin conscripted an additional 300,000 men – throwing more and more of Russia’s young people into a meat grinder of his own making.  And he unleashed the Wagner Group – mercenaries who have committed atrocities from Africa to the Middle East, and now, in Ukraine.

Of course, that’s not the whole story of the last year.

There is also the story of Ukraine’s people.  Vastly outnumbered, they have fought bravely to defend their nation, their freedom, the right to determine their own future.  And they’ve demonstrated inspiring unity in helping one another endure Moscow’s relentless assault.

Teachers and community members give classes in bunkers to children.  City workers improvise patches to restore heat and power and water to residents.  Neighbors set up soup kitchens to feed the hungry.

There’s also the story of how the international community has come together.

The vast majority of member-states have voted multiple times to condemn Russia’s violations of the UN Charter and reject its illegal attempt to seize Ukrainian territory.  Yesterday, 141 countries voted in the General Assembly for a resolution that reaffirms the core principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity, denounces Russia’s atrocities, expresses support for a just and comprehensive peace, in accordance with the United Nations Charter.

When President Putin tried to weaponize hunger – exploiting the worst global food crisis since the creation of the UN – the international community responded swiftly.

Since the United States chaired a Food Security meeting last May, more than 100 countries have signed onto a set of concrete commitments to alleviate hunger.  Thanks in large part to the Secretary-General Guterres and Türkiye, the Black Sea Grain Initiative loosened Russia’s stranglehold on Ukraine’s ports and brought down the cost of grain for the world.  Now, as Moscow again tries to throttle its output, we have to ensure that that initiative is extended and expanded.

When President Putin tried to weaponize energy, we redirected natural gas supplies from across the world, so that countries Russia targeted could keep their people warm in the winter.  And Europe took extraordinary steps to end its dependence on Russian energy.

No country has endured greater hardship from Russia’s war than Ukraine, but almost every country has felt the pain.  And yet, nations around the world continue to stand with Ukraine.  Because we all recognize that if we abandon Ukraine, we abandon the UN Charter itself, and the principles and rules that make all countries safer and more secure.

No seizing land by force.

No erasing another country’s borders.

No targeting civilians in war.

No wars of aggression.

If we do not defend these basic principles, we invite a world in which might makes right, the strong dominate the weak.  That’s the world this body was created to end.  And members of this council have a unique responsibility to make sure that we do not return to it.  We can do that in three ways.

First, we must push for a just and durable peace.

Now I expect that many countries will call for peace today.

No one wants peace more than the Ukrainian people.  And the United States has long made clear – even before this war – that we’re prepared to engage in any meaningful diplomatic effort to stop Russia’s aggression against Ukraine.

But history teaches us that it’s the nature of peace that matters.

For peace to be just, it must uphold the principles at the heart of the UN Charter: sovereignty, territorial integrity, independence.

For peace to be durable, it must ensure that Russia can’t simply rest, rearm, and relaunch the war in a few months or a few years.

Any peace that legitimizes Russia’s seizure of land by force will weaken the charter and send a message to would-be aggressors everywhere that they can invade countries and get away with it.

President Zelenskyy has put forward a ten-point plan for a just and durable peace.  President Putin, by contrast, has made clear that there is nothing to talk about until Ukraine accepts, and I quote, “the new territorial realities,” while doubling down on his brutal tactics.

Members of this council have a fundamental responsibility to ensure that any peace is just and durable.

Council members should not be fooled by calls for a temporary or unconditional ceasefire.  Russia will use any pause in fighting to consolidate control over the territory it’s illegally seized and replenish its forces for further attacks.  That’s what happened when Russia’s first assault on Ukraine froze in 2015.  Look at what followed.

And members of this council should not fall into the false equivalency of calling on both sides to stop fighting, or calling on other nations to stop supporting Ukraine in the name of peace.

No member of this council should call for peace while supporting Russia’s war on Ukraine and on the UN Charter.

In this war, there is an aggressor and there is a victim.

Russia fights for conquest.  Ukraine fights for its freedom.

If Russia stops fighting and leaves Ukraine, the war ends.  If Ukraine stops fighting, Ukraine ends.

The fact remains:  One man – Vladimir Putin – started this war; one man can end it.

Second, even as we work to end Russia’s war against Ukraine, members of this council must continue to address other challenges to international peace and security.

We hear the concerns of countries who worry that standing with Ukraine and holding Russia accountable is diverting focus and resources from others in need.

To those countries, I would say, simply, look at our actions.

And when you hear Russia and its defenders accuse the countries who support Ukraine of ignoring the rest of the world – I say look at Moscow’s actions.

Compare the numbers.  In addition to the $13.5 billion in food aid that the United States contributed to fight hunger over the last year, we also fund more than 40 percent of the World Food Program’s budget.  Russia contributes less than 1 percent of that budget.

That’s not an outlier.  Based on the latest UN figures, the United States donates over nine times as much as Russia to UN peacekeeping.  We donate 390 times as much as Russia to UNICEF.  We give nearly a thousand times as much as Russia to the UN Refugee Agency.

Third, we must reaffirm our commitment to upholding what the UN Charter calls, and I quote, “the dignity and worth of the human person.”

We must continue to compile evidence of Russia’s ongoing and widespread atrocities, including executions; torture; rape and sexual violence; the deportation of thousands of Ukrainian civilians to Russia.

We must continue to document Russia’s war crimes and crimes against humanity, and share this evidence with investigators and prosecutors, so that one day, the perpetrators can be held accountable.

Day after day of Russia’s atrocities, it’s easy to become numb to the horror, to lose our ability to feel shock and outrage.  But we can never let the crimes Russia is committing become our new normal.

Bucha is not normal.  Mariupol is not normal.  Irpin is not normal.  Bombing schools and hospitals and apartment buildings to rubble is not normal.  Stealing Ukrainian children from their families and giving them to people in Russia is not normal.

We must not let President Putin’s callous indifference to human life become our own.

We must force ourselves to remember that behind every atrocity in this wretched war, in conflicts around the world, is a human being.

I recently visited an exhibit of artwork made by Ukrainian children affected by the war.

One painting I saw was made by a ten-year-old girl named Veronika.  Last April, Russian forces shelled her home in Vuhledar, killing her whole family.  When first responders dug her from the rubble, a piece of shrapnel was lodged in her skull.  Her left thumb had been ripped off.  Doctors saved her life, but the attack left her right hand mostly paralyzed, and she can’t see out of her left eye.

In her painting, Veronika drew herself in a bright pink and orange dress, holding a bouquet of flowers.  A building stands next to her.  When asked who lived there, she said it was a place where all the people she knew who had been killed in the war could be safe.

“We the peoples of the United Nations determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war…” That’s how the UN Charter begins.

Fellow members of this council:  Now is the time to meet that promise.  There are so many people in Ukraine who want the same thing as that little girl, Veronika: a world where they can live in peace, in their own country, and keep the people they love safe.

We have the power, we have the responsibility to create that world, today and for generations to come.  We cannot – we will not – let one country destroy it.

Thank you.

Special Briefing

Brussels Media Hub

October 10, 2023

MODERATOR: Good afternoon from the U.S. Department’s Brussels Media Hub. I would like to welcome everyone joining us today for this virtual press briefing. We’re very honored to be joined by Ambassador Julianne Smith, the U.S. permanent representative to NATO. Before I turn it over to the ambassador for opening remarks, I have a few comments on the procedure for asking questions. If you’re dailing by phone, you can join the questions queue by pressing *9 at any time. If you are joining us via the Zoom application or link, you may submit your questions at any time by clicking on the questions and Answers tab and typing in your question. If you see a colleague ask a question you like Ambassador Smith to cover, you can upload it in the queue by clicking the like button to the right of that question. If you’d like to ask your question live, you can click the erase hand icon at the bottom of the window. We will try to get to as many questions as possible in the 30 minutes that we have today. So please show your support and like the questions you most like us to cover. As always, you can notify us of any technical difficulties at theBrusselsHub@tate.gov. With that, let’s get started. Ambassador Smith, thank you so much for joining us today. I’ll turn it over to you for opening remarks.

AMBASSADOR SMITH: Well, thank you very much. Thanks to the Brussels Media Hub for facilitating this hub call today, this interview. Always helpful to have this check in before a Defense Ministerial and the UDCG (Ukraine Defense Contact Group). Let me first though, start by acknowledging just the unspeakable, tragic, tragic attacks, terrible events in Israel last few days. And let me echo the comments of President Biden. The United States unequivocally condemns the appalling assault against Israel by Hamas terrorists from Gaza, and the United States has made clear to Prime Minister Netanyahu that we stand ready to offer all appropriate means of support to the government and the people of Israel. Terrorism is never justified. But of course, as I mentioned, the reason that we’re here today is to preview both the Defense Ministerial that’s coming up very quickly as well as the Ukraine Defense Contact Group that will begin tomorrow. I want to also just say a few words about a recent trip we had with all of the NATO’s perm reps. We went to both Norfolk and Washington about two weeks ago, and I’ll say a few words about that trip maybe first.

We had a series of high level engagements across Washington with National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, with Secretary of State Tony Blinken. We were able to meet Deputy Secretary of Defense Kath Hicks, as well as a whole array of other high level officials. We also were able to spend some time in Congress, which was very important. We were able to take the group to both the House and the Senate to get perspectives on Ukraine support and also their views on the NATO alliance and the upcoming Washington summit next summer. And then, of course, we were able to go to Allied Command Transformation in Norfolk and go to Joint Forces Command, which is in Norfolk as well. I would say it was an extremely productive trip, but in relation to what’s transpired in the United States in recent days, I think it was important for the group to hear directly from members of Congress about the bipartisan support for our assistance to Ukraine. The message that came across loud and clear was that the United States will continue to support Ukraine for as long as it takes. And I think our allies appreciated hearing that message in stereo surround sound. Similarly, I think it was also important for our friends in Europe and in Canada to ensure that all of the interlocutors had a deep appreciation for all that Europe and Canada are doing for Ukraine as individual allies. There have been unprecedented levels of economic, humanitarian assistance, security assistance. Many of them are housing refugees, some of them millions of refugees, as you all know. And European allies have increased their defense budgets over the last two years. They’ve led on training Ukrainian pilots on the F-16 planes, and they’ve transferred a whole series of critical weapons systems to Ukraine that are really making a difference on the battlefield. So we wanted to ensure that we could have a conversation with American interlocutors. Many of them are fully aware of those contributions. But for anybody who wasn’t tracking the depth of support, I think it was an important opportunity for NATO to stand together, both in Washington and Norfolk and talk about those those contributions.

Now, let’s pivot quickly to what’s happening here at NATO’s headquarters this week. We will be welcoming, obviously, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, but also the new chairman of the Joint Chiefs, we’ll have General CQ Brown here to join us for the UDCG and of course the Defense Ministerial here in Brussels as well. As you all know, the UDCG is an important opportunity for over 50 countries to come together on a monthly basis, to sit down with our friends in Ukraine, hear about their current requirements and then move out on meeting those commitments. I suspect what you’re going to hear in this UDCG is a continued emphasis on both air defense and ammunition, as well as an array of other systems that they currently need. But those two categories will probably take precedence above many of the other things that they will be turning to the 50 countries for in the coming weeks and months.

On the DMM, I think this will be what’s important about this DMM is, it’s the first Defense Ministerial where we are going to be able to hold a NATO-Ukraine Council. This of course is a new development, something that was rolled out with the Vilnius Summit just a couple of months ago. Ukraine will actually sit in that meeting as an equal with NATO allies to work on a variety of issues, looking at how we can cooperate better on everything from cyber defense to combating disinformation or even Ukraine’s aspirations for NATO membership.

Now lastly, while the alliance is certainly more united than ever before on confronting a variety of shared security challenges, we had expected to be confronting these challenges as an alliance of 32 and not 31. As I have said before, we believe in the United States Sweden is ready to join the alliance, it is ready to do so today. They are already a committed partner and invitee. They are ready to be a committed, full fledged ally. They will no doubt make the alliance stronger and safer and more secure. And we believe that it is time for Hungary and Türkiye to honor their commitments and complete the ratification process in order to have Sweden join the alliance as soon as possible.

So with that, that gives you a little bit of a sense of what will be focused on here this week at NATO headquarters. And I’m looking forward to taking your questions.

MODERATOR: Thank you, Ambassador, for those opening remarks. We will now turn to the questions and answer portion of today’s briefing. As a reminder, you may type in your question in any time in the Q&A tab, raise your hand or dial *9
if you are dialed in. Let’s, first question will go to pre submitted question from Elina Kervinen from the Helsingin Sanomat in Finland: The Hamas attack has turned all eyes to Israel. What kind of discussion do you expect on this subject in the meeting and do you expect this new escalation to have any effect when it comes to supporting Ukraine?

AMBASSADOR SMITH: I guess I’ll work backwards in that regard. On the question of whether or not U.S. support for Israel could possibly come at the expense of U.S. support for Ukraine, we don’t anticipate any major challenges in that regard. The U.S. has had a long standing commitment to Israel’s security. We will continue to meet that commitment and in fact, as you heard from senior levels of the Biden administration, including from the President himself, we are going to look at additional steps we might take. You’ve no doubt heard the news that the United States is moving the USS Gerald R. Ford closer to Israel as a deterrent. He’s asked his team to look at additional measures. I suspect the United States will be able to stay focused on our partnership and commitment to Israel’s security, while also meeting our commitments and promise to continue supporting Ukraine as it defends its territory and protects and all of the values that all of us hold dear here across the NATO alliance.

MODERATOR: Thank you.

AMBASSADOR SMITH: Oh, was there another question, I think. Oh, so there was, sorry. There was the first question, which was the degree to which Israel will be part of the conversations here at the Defense Ministerial. I don’t have specific details to share with you. I think allies, no doubt will want to talk about what happened in Israel and express their solidarity. We’ve seen all members of the alliance issue their own national statements really in real time, almost as the attack was was ongoing, and I suspect that will be part of our conversation. Stay tuned for any additional details on that particular subject.

MODERATOR: Thank you, Ambassador. And we’ll go to a live question now: Mehmet Krasniqi from RTV Dukagjini Nikki. Mehmet, your mike is open.

QUESTION: Hi Mrs Ambassador, I am Mehmet Krasniqi from Dukagjini Radio and Television. I hope you hear me. You are probably aware of reports that the terrorist group responsible for the 24th of September attacks used Serbia military bases for trainings. Are you aware of this information and what’s your comments about it? And Hezbollah? Are you waiting for a NATO official to brought this issue up with Serbian officials? Thank you.

AMBASSADOR SMITH: I don’t have anything to share on that particular incident that you’re mentioning. I will say we have all been here at NATO HQ, all the allies closely monitoring the situation on the ground in the Western Balkans. We have been concerned about increasing signs of instability and some flashpoints where we’ve seen an uptick in violence, as a result KFOR took the decision in recent days to draw from some of its strategic reserve forces. We now have had a plus up of our forces of a few hundred coming primarily from the United Kingdom and Romania. We will continue to message our friends in the region that the only path forward to normalization is through the EU led facilitated dialog, which is strongly supported across the NATO alliance. We will continue to work with SACEUR to see if he believes anything additional should be required for NATO forces on the ground in Kosovo. I know he is looking at whether or not KFOR has the right level of capabilities and readiness to prepare, to handle any potential contingencies. But that is an area of focus for the alliance, and we will continue to look at that region and urge de-escalation.

MODERATOR: Thank you, ma’am. We’ll go to another pre-selected question. We had a number of questions following this line. Alexander Ward from Politico. Admiral Rob Bauer recently said NATO allies could see the “bottom of the barrel” of weapon supplies to send to Ukraine. Does the United States agree with that assessment?

AMBASSADOR SMITH: I think what we’ve seen across the alliance is a number of countries individually have really moved heaven and earth to give everything they possibly can to the Ukrainian people so that they can ensure that they have what they need to defend their territory. Situations obviously vary from one country to another. We have some countries that are prepared to give more. We have some member states that have noted that they’ve given a lot and they want to ensure that they can also maintain their own national defense. But in those cases, those countries have looked for creative ways to address some of their backfill requirements so that they could find more to give. Some countries are also purchasing assets and weapons that they might be able to donate. And we’ve seen a number of countries around the world step forward and offer backfill support to those allies that are providing security assistance. So again, they can find some additional ways to support Ukraine. So I think we will come out of the UDCG this week with additional forms of assistance. We will see allies continuing to look for ways to meet those urgent requirements that the Ukrainians are putting on the table. And most importantly, NATO here has all of the allies here at NATO have been focused on increasing production in our own countries across Europe, working in some cases multilaterally, bilaterally, to find ways to get those production lines, to produce some of the capabilities that are required at a faster clip. So this is all part of an effort here at NAITO to ensure that NATO allies have what they need for their national defense, can continue to find ways to support Ukraine, and showcase alliance solidarity as we stand with the people of Ukraine.

MODERATOR: Thank you, Ambassador. We’ll go to another submitted question, this time from Andre Popescu from Panorama. How worried is the alliance about the Russian drone attacks taking place at the border of Romania targeting Ukrainian Danube harbours, some of them violating Romanian airspace or possibly crashing in Romanian territory. Are there any precautionary measures or reactions that NATO is taking to tackle this issue?

AMBASSADOR SMITH: Well, we’ve been in close contact with our friends in Romania to better understand what’s happening, what has happened to date, and how we might all provide additional vigilance activities that would help them protect their territory. The Alliance has undertaken a series of steps since Russia went into Ukraine last year to reinforce the eastern flank. We now have allied troops that are present inside Romania addressing their very legitimate and real security concerns. Obviously, in light of some of these drone incidents, SACEUR has been looking at ways to again enhance vigilance activities. So that we can monitor these events, better understand them and hopefully deter them. We have warned the Russians about these types of incidents and will continue to do so. But when we say that we are here to protect every inch of NATO’s territory, we mean it. And we’ve undertaken a series of steps to ensure that we can do so.

MODERATOR: Thank you, ma’am. Going to a question from Reuters in Turkey, Tuvan Gumrukcu. Have Turkish officials provided you with any timeline regarding the ratification of Sweden’s NATO bid? If this process were to be delayed any further, what sort of implications would this have on U.S.-Turkey ties? Would it in any way affect Ankara’s procurement of F-16s and modernization kits from the United States?

AMBASSADOR SMITH: Well, the timeline that was offered was really what we heard from President Erdogan himself, when we were all at the Vilnius summit last summer in July. And at that time, he said that he believed Sweden had addressed all of Türkiye’s concerns and that he personally was ready to move out and move forward with the process of ratification. That was complicated to do at the time because the parliament inside Türkiye was getting ready to head into recess. So there was an acknowledgment that this would likely happen sometime in October. I think what Türkiye has heard from all of the Allies is that we very much hope that this process now will move forward with great speed and urgency. We obviously are eager to have Sweden sit at the table as a full fledged member. This isn’t just a question of Sweden’s security, although that’s a big part of it. They obviously are interested in finalizing membership as soon as possible, but this is also a question of Alliance security. It won’t surprise you to hear that many of our friends in the Baltic States and in that particular region, the Nordic Baltic region, are also very interested in ensuring that Sweden become a member as soon as possible. So this is a matter for all of us. It would mean a great deal to get this done as soon as possible because we are in the process of implementing and executing NATO’s new regional plans, that were just rolled out at the Vilnius summit. So I think we anticipate that this will happen sooner rather than later. We have worked closely with our friends in Hungary and Türkiye to make sure that they understand the urgency, and we very much hope that President Erdogan will deliver on the pledge that he made in Vilnius.

MODERATOR: Thank you, Ambassador. Question from Paul McLeary, Politico. Is NATO’s taking a new look at Black Sea security, particularly boosting the naval or air defense capabilities of allies who border the Black Sea?

AMBASSADOR SMITH: Right now, we are for all the obvious reasons. Clearly, the Black Sea is an area that we’re monitoring quite closely, in particular because of what we mentioned earlier, some of these incidents with drones landing or breaking up over Romanian territory. So this has been a focus for the alliance. We’ve looked at it closely. There are air policing missions close to that particular neighborhood, and we are looking to fill any existing gaps that exist in NATO’s air policing missions in the neighborhood. It will continue to be an area that we monitor quite closely, and all of us are very focused on trying to find ways to get the grain out of Ukraine now that Russia has decided to kill the Black Sea Grain Initiative. We’re looking at additional routes down through the Danube and overland. Unfortunately, those routes are not so well developed as to replicate exactly what we were able to get out through the Black Sea itself. But we’re looking to expand those routes as fast as possible. And lastly, I’ll say we really salute our friends in Türkiye and for the efforts that they have undertaken not only to establish the Black Sea Grain Initiative when it was first created last year, but their recent efforts to try and get it back online.

MODERATOR: Thank you, ma’am. I think we have time for one more question, going to Zoriana Stepanenko, RFE/RL’s Ukrainian Service. The Ukrainian Defense Contact Group, what will they be focused on tomorrow, given the most urgent needs of Ukraine? What kind of military aid can be expected, given also the current capacities of Allies and partners united in a so-called Rammstein format?

AMBASSADOR SMITH: Well, as I said at the top, I anticipate that the emphasis will be mostly on air defense and ammunition, although no doubt the Ukrainians will come in with a variety of other requests. I can’t say with certainty what will come out of the actual meeting. It always is an organic meeting where ministers step forward and offer assistance in real time, and in some cases we hear about that for the first time in the UDCG. So we cannot predict exactly what will happen. But I say air defense and ammunition really for two reasons. One, because those sets of capabilities are still very important for the battles that the Ukrainians are fighting today, but also air defense in particular is going to be critical during those winter months where we have seen the Russians rely on indiscriminate attacks on civilian infrastructure, critical infrastructure to try and plunge the Ukrainian people into cold and darkness. We want to make sure that the Ukrainians this winter have the air defense assets they need to harden those critical infrastructure nodes and ensure that Russian efforts to leave Ukrainians in the dark and cold are ultimately unsuccessful. So that air defense component, very, very important for now and later. And that’s why I suspect you’ll see a special emphasis placed on air defense when all the ministers meet tomorrow.

MODERATOR: Thank you, Ambassador. I’m afraid that’s all the time we have for today. Thanks everyone, for your questions, and thank you, Ambassador Smith, for taking the time to join us. Before we close the call, I turn it back to you quickly for any final thoughts.

AMBASSADOR SMITH: Well, just thanks again for everybody’s interest in checking in before the DMM and the UDCG. We’re looking forward to this meeting. I think it comes at a wonderful time to signal to the Russians in particular, but also the people of Ukraine that our support collectively remains unwavering. And we will continue to find important ways to support Ukraine in the months ahead.

MODERATOR: Thank you.

Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State

Helsinki City Hall

Helsinki, Finland

June 2, 2023

MAYOR VARTIAINEN:  Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, dear friends, it is my great pleasure to warmly welcome you all to the beautiful capital of Finland, Helsinki, and the Helsinki City Hall.  Helsinki has a great honor to host this special event today.  We are humbled and in great appreciation to have the U.S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken here in Helsinki.

Helsinki is a city where the harmonious blend of history, innovation, freedom, and diplomacy converges.  Our capital is and has been an arena for numerous high-level meetings and political events, and we are proud to provide the platform for this historical moment, now for the first time as the proud capital of a new NATO Ally.

Now it is my great pleasure to introduce you the co-organizer of the event, Dr. Mika Aaltola, the director of the Finnish Institute of International Affairs.  Thank you.  (Applause.)

MR AALTOLA:  Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, this is a truly historical day.  It is the first time that a United States secretary of state stands on the solid granite ground of NATO Finland.  Secretary Blinken’s visit represents a new era in the Finnish-U.S. relations that have long historical ties.  Never before have the relations between our two countries been this close.

In addition to now being NATO Allies, Finland and the United States are working together to enhance our bilateral defense cooperation.  Also, economic cooperation has increased significantly as the U.S. became Finland’s number one trade partner last year.

While physically separated by an ocean, our countries are bound by ties that surpass distance.  We face common security challenges, but even more importantly, we share a belief in democracy, in our common values and shared interests.

These values are being challenged by Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine.  With the level of economic and military support it has offered to Ukraine, the United States remains the indispensable force in Europe.  The U.S. was already awake when most of Europe was still sleeping, relatively undisturbed by Russia’s power political gaming.  U.S. leadership is as needed as ever.

This leadership helps to keep doors open and enemies at bay, but there would be no leadership without a partnership.  This partnership is something that Finland has offered to the United States.  Finland is an able ally and a security provider.  We carry our responsibilities in our region and beyond, and we are committed to support Ukraine and to defend ourselves and the values we stand for.  This commitment is shared by the Finnish leadership but, even more importantly, by the Finnish people.

Finland has ranked as the least corrupt, most egalitarian, one of the most educated, and most democratic countries in the world.  It also is the most stable country in the world.  In these volatile times, this stability has a value of its own.  Surprisingly for many Finns, Finland is also the happiest country in the world.  We question this result every year, but it is pointed to us that it is the case.  It is a fact, so how miserable others must be if we are the happiest.  (Laughter.)

But now I’m truly happy to be able to welcome on the stage with United States Secretary of State Mr. Antony Blinken.  (Applause.)

SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  And yes, I feel a greater sense of happiness today than I’ve felt in a long time.  (Laughter.)

Mayor Vartiainen, thank you for hosting us here in Helsinki, and in this absolutely magnificent city hall.

And Mika, my thanks to you, and also to your entire team – all of the researchers at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs, for deepening the scholarship about diplomacy, and also enriching the public debate.

I’m also gratified that my friend and my partner, Pekka Haavisto, is here with us today.  We have worked so closely together over this past truly historic year, and I’m grateful for your presence.

To all of the distinguished guests, two months ago, I stood with our Allies in Brussels as Finland’s flag was raised over NATO headquarters for the first time.  President Niinistö declared, and I quote, “The era of military nonalignment in Finland has come to an end.  A new era begins.”

It was a sea change that would have been unthinkable a little more than a year earlier.  Before Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, one in four Finns supported the country joining NATO.  After the full-scale invasion, three in four Finns supported joining.

It wasn’t hard for Finns to imagine themselves in the Ukrainians’ shoes.  They’d walked in them in November 1939, when the Soviet Union invaded Finland.

Like President Putin’s so-called “special operation” against Ukraine, the USSR’s so-called “liberation operation” falsely accused Finland of provoking the invasion.

Like the Russians with Kyiv, the Soviets were confident that they’d sack Helsinki in weeks – so confident that they had Dmitri Shostakovich compose music for the victory parade, before the Winter War even started.

Like Putin in Ukraine, when Stalin failed to overcome the Finns’ fierce and determined resistance, he shifted to a strategy of terror, incinerating entire villages and bombing so many hospitals from the air that Finns started covering up the Red Cross insignia on the rooftops.

Like the millions of Ukrainian refugees today, hundreds of thousands of Finns were driven from their homes by the Soviet invasion.  They included two children, Pirkko and Henri, whose families evacuated their homes in Karelia – the mother and father of our host, the mayor of the city.

To many Finns, the parallels between 1939 and 2022 were striking.  They were visceral.  And they were not wrong.

Finns understood that if Russia violated the core principles of the UN Charter – sovereignty, territorial integrity, independence – if they did that in Ukraine, it will imperil their own peace and security as well.

We understood that, too.  That’s why, over the course of 2021, as Russia ratcheted up its threats against Kyiv and amassed more and more troops, tanks, and planes on Ukraine’s borders, we made every effort to get Moscow to de-escalate its manufactured crisis and resolve its issues through diplomacy.

President Biden told President Putin that we were prepared to discuss our mutual security concerns – a message that I reaffirmed repeatedly – including in person, with Foreign Minister Lavrov.  We offered written proposals to reduce tensions.  Together with our allies and partners, we used every forum to try to prevent war, from the NATO-Russia Council to the OSCE, from the UN to our direct channels.

Across these engagements, we set out two possible paths for Moscow: a path of diplomacy, which could lead to greater security for Ukraine, for Russia, for all of Europe; or a path of aggression, which would result in severe consequences for the Russian Government.

President Biden made clear that regardless of which path President Putin chose, we would be ready.  And if Russia chose war, we would do three things: support Ukraine, impose severe costs on Russia, and strengthen NATO while rallying our allies and partners around these goals.

As the storm clouds gathered, we surged military, economic, and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine.  First in August 2021, and again in December, we sent military equipment to bolster Ukraine’s defenses, including Javelins and Stingers.  And we deployed a team from the U.S. Cyber Command to help Ukraine shore up its power grid and other critical infrastructure against cyber attacks.

We prepared an unprecedented set of sanctions, export controls, other economic costs to impose severe and immediate consequences on Russia in the event of a full-scale invasion.

We took steps to leave no doubt that we, and our Allies, would uphold our commitment to defend every inch of NATO territory.

And we worked relentlessly to rally allies and partners around helping Ukraine defend itself and denying Putin his strategic aims.

Since day one of his administration, President Biden has focused on rebuilding and revitalizing America’s alliances and partnerships, knowing that we’re stronger when we work alongside those who share our interests and our values.

In the run-up to Russia’s invasion, we demonstrated the power of those partnerships – coordinating our planning and strategy for a potential invasion with NATO, with the EU, with the G7, and other allies and partners from around the world.

Over those fateful weeks in January and February of 2022, it became clear that no amount of diplomatic effort was going to change President Putin’s mind.  He would choose war.

And so, on February 17, 2022, I went before the United Nations Security Council to warn the world that Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine was imminent.

I set out the steps that Russia would take:  first manufacturing a pretext, and then using missiles, tanks, troops, cyber attacks to strike pre-identified targets, including Kyiv, with the aim of toppling Ukraine’s democratically elected government and erasing Ukraine from the map as an independent country.

We hoped – we hoped – to be proven wrong.

Unfortunately, we were right.  A week after my warning to the Security Council, President Putin invaded.  Ukrainians of all walks of life – soldiers and citizens, men and women, young and old – bravely defended their nation.

And the United States moved swiftly, decisively, and in unison with allies and partners to do exactly what we said we’d do: support Ukraine, impose costs on Russia, strengthen NATO – all of this with our allies and partners.

And with our collective support, Ukraine did what it said it would do: defended its territory, its independence, its democracy.

Today, what I want to do is set out this and the many other ways Putin’s war of aggression against Ukraine has been a strategic failure, greatly diminishing Russia’s power, its interests, and its influence for years to come.  And I’ll also share our vision of the path to a just and lasting peace.

When you look at President Putin’s long-term strategic aims and objectives, there is no question:  Russia is significantly worse off today than it was before its full-scale invasion of Ukraine – militarily, economically, geopolitically.

Where Putin aimed to project strength, he’s revealed weakness.  Where he sought to divide, he’s united.  What he tried to prevent, he’s precipitated.  That outcome is no accident. It’s the direct result of the courage and solidarity of the Ukrainian people and the deliberate, decisive, swift action that we and our partners have taken to support Ukraine.

First, for years, President Putin sought to weaken and divide NATO, under the false claim that it posed a threat to Russia.  In fact, before Russia invaded Crimea and eastern Ukraine in 2014, NATO’s posture reflected a shared conviction that conflict in Europe was unlikely.  The United States had significantly reduced its forces in Europe since the end of the Cold War, from 315,000 in 1989 to 61,000 at the end of 2013.  Many European countries’ spending on defense had been declining for years.  NATO’s strategic doctrine at the time labeled Russia a partner.

Following Russia’s invasion of Crimea and the Donbas in 2014, that tide began to turn.  Allies committed to spend two percent of GDP on defense and deployed new forces to NATO’s eastern flank in response to Russia’s aggression.   The Alliance has accelerated its transformation since Russia’s full-scale invasion – not to pose a threat or because NATO seeks conflict.  NATO always has been – and always will be – a defensive alliance.  But Russia’s aggression, threats, nuclear saber-rattling compelled us to reinforce our deterrence and defense.

Hours after the full-scale invasion, we activated NATO’s defensive Response Force. In the weeks that followed, several Allies – including the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, Spain, France – swiftly sent troops, aircraft, and ships to reinforce NATO’s eastern flank.  We doubled the number of ships patrolling the North and Baltic seas, and doubled the number of battle groups in the region.  The United States established its first permanent military presence in Poland.  And, of course, NATO added Finland as its 31st Ally, and we will soon add Sweden as the 32nd.

As we head into the NATO Summit in Vilnius, our shared message will be clear:  NATO Allies are committed to enhanced deterrence and defense, to greater and smarter defense spending, to deeper ties with Indo-Pacific partners.  NATO’s door remains open to new members, and it will stay open.

Russia’s invasion has also led the European Union to do more – and more together with the United States and with NATO – than ever before.  The EU and its member-states have provided over $75 billion in military, economic, humanitarian support to Ukraine.  That includes $18 billion in security assistance, from air defense systems to Leopard tanks to ammunition.  Coordinating closely with the U.S., the U.K., and other partners, the EU has launched its most ambitious sanctions ever, immobilizing over half of Russia’s sovereign assets.  And European nations have taken in more than 8 million Ukrainian refugees, most of whom have not only been granted access to public services, but also the right to work, to study.

Second, for decades, Moscow worked to deepen Europe’s dependence on Russian oil and gas.  Since President Putin’s full-scale invasion, Europe has made a swift and decisive turn away from Russian energy.  Berlin immediately canceled Nord Stream 2, which would have doubled the flow of Russian gas to Germany.

Before Putin’s invasion, European countries imported 37 percent of their natural gas from Russia.  Europe cut that by more than half in less than a year.  In 2022, EU countries generated a record one-fifth of their electricity through wind and solar – more electricity than the EU generated through coal, gas, or any other power source.  The United States for its part more than doubled our supply of gas to Europe, and our Asian allies – Japan, the Republic of Korea – also stepped up to boost Europe’s supply.

Meanwhile, the oil price cap that we and our G7 partners put in place has kept Russia’s energy in the global market, while dramatically cutting Russian revenues.  A year into its invasion, Russia’s oil revenues had fallen by 43 percent.  The Russian Government’s tax revenues from oil and gas have fallen by nearly two-thirds.  And Moscow will not get back the markets that it has lost in Europe.

Third, President Putin spent two decades trying to build Russia’s military into a modern force, with cutting-edge weaponry, streamlined command, and well-trained, well-equipped soldiers.  The Kremlin often claimed it had the second-strongest military in the world, and many believed it.  Today, many see Russia’s military as the second-strongest in Ukraine.  Its equipment, technology, leadership, troops, strategy, tactics, and morale, a case study in failure – even as Moscow inflicts devastating, indiscriminate, and gratuitous damage on Ukraine and Ukrainians.

Russia is estimated to have suffered more than 100,000 casualties in the last six months alone, as Putin sends wave after wave of Russians into a meat grinder of his own making.

Meanwhile, sanctions and export controls imposed by the United States, the European Union, and other partners around the world have severely degraded Russia’s war machine and defense exports, setting them back for years to come.  Russia’s global defense partners and customers can no longer count on promised orders, let alone spare parts.  And as they witness Russia’s poor performance on the battlefield, they are increasingly taking their business elsewhere.

Fourth, President Putin wanted to build Russia up as a global, economic power.  His invasion cemented his long-running failure to diversify Russia’s economy, to strengthen its human capital, to fully integrate the country into the global economy.  Today, Russia’s economy is a shadow of what it was, and a fraction of what it could have become had Putin invested in technology and innovation rather than weapons and war.

Russia’s foreign reserves are down by more than half, as are profits from its state-owned enterprises.  More than 1,700 foreign companies have reduced, suspended, or ended operations in Russia since the onset of the invasion.  That’s tens of thousands of jobs gone, a massive flight of foreign expertise, and billions of dollars in lost revenue for the Kremlin.

A million people have fled Russia, including many of the country’s top IT specialists, entrepreneurs, engineers, doctors, professors, journalists, scientists.  Countless artists, writers, filmmakers, musicians have also left, seeing no future for themselves in a country where they can’t express themselves freely.

Fifth, President Putin invested considerable effort to show that Russia could be a valued partner to China.  On the eve of the invasion, Beijing and Moscow declared a “no limits” partnership.  Eighteen months into the invasion, that two-way partnership looks more and more one-sided.  Putin’s aggression and weaponization of strategic dependencies on Russia has served as a wake-up call to governments around the world to make efforts at de-risking.  And together, the United States and our partners are taking steps to reduce those vulnerabilities, from building more resilient critical supply chains to strengthening our shared tools to counter economic coercion.

So, Russia’s aggression hasn’t distracted us from meeting the challenges in the Indo-Pacific.  It’s actually sharpened our focus on them.  And our support for Ukraine hasn’t weakened our capabilities to meet potential threats from China or anywhere else – it’s strengthened them. And we believe that Beijing is taking notice that, far from being intimidated by a forceful violation of the UN Charter, the world has rallied to defend it.

Sixth, prior to the war, President Putin regularly used Russia’s influence in international organizations to try to weaken the United Nations Charter.  Today, Russia is more isolated on the world stage than ever.  At least 140 nations – two-thirds of UN member-states – have repeatedly voted in the UN General Assembly to affirm Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, to reject Putin’s attempts to illegally annex Ukrainian territory, to condemn Russia’s aggression and atrocities, and to call for a peace consistent with the principles of the United Nations Charter.  Governments from the West and East, North and South have voted to suspend Russia from numerous institutions, from the UN Human Rights Council to the International Civil Aviation Organization.  Russian candidates have lost one election after another for key seats in international institutions, from the governing board of UNICEF to leadership of the UN agency responsible for information and communication technologies, the ITU.

Each rebuke and loss for Moscow is not only a vote against Russia’s aggression, it’s a vote for the core principles of the United Nations Charter.   And countries from every part of the world are supporting efforts to hold Russia accountable for its war crimes and crimes against humanity, from creating a special UN commission to document the crimes and human rights violations committed in Russia’s war to assisting investigations by prosecutors in Ukraine and at the International Criminal Court.

Seventh, President Putin, for years, sought to divide the West from the rest, claiming that Russia was advancing the best interests of the developing world.   Today, thanks to openly declaring his imperial ambitions and weaponizing food and fuel, President Putin has diminished Russian influence on every continent.  Putin’s efforts to reconstitute a centuries-old empire reminded every nation that had endured colonial rule and repression of their own pain.  Then, he exacerbated the economic hardship many nations were already experiencing due to COVID and climate change by cutting off Ukraine’s grain from the world markets, driving up the cost of food and fuel everywhere.

By contrast, on one global challenge after another, the United States and our partners have proven that our focus on Ukraine will not distract us from working to improve the lives of people around the world and address the cascading costs of Russia’s aggression.

Our unprecedented emergency food aid has prevented millions of people from starving to death. Just last year alone, the United States provided $13.5 billion in food assistance.  And the United States is currently funding over half of the UN World Food Programme’s budget.  Russia funds less than one percent.

We supported a deal negotiated by UN Secretary-General Guterres and Türkiye to break Russia’s stranglehold on Ukrainian grain, allowing 29 million tons of food and counting to get out of Ukraine and to people around the world.  That includes 8 million tons of wheat, which is the equivalent of roughly 16 billion loaves of bread.

Together with allies and partners, we’re mobilizing hundreds of billions of dollars in financing for high-quality infrastructure in the countries where it’s needed most and building it in a way that’s transparent, good for the environment; empowers local workers and communities.

We’re strengthening global health security, from training half a million health professionals in our own hemisphere, in the Americas, to helping the pharmaceutical company Moderna finalize plans with Kenya to build its first mRNA vaccine manufacturing facility in Africa.

Time and again, we are demonstrating who fuels global problems and who solves them.

Finally, President Putin’s core aim – indeed, his obsession – has been to erase the very idea of Ukraine – its identity, its people, its culture, its agency, its territory.  But here, too, Putin’s actions have precipitated the opposite effect.  No one has done more to strengthen Ukraine’s national identity than the man who sought to wipe it out.  No one has done more to deepen Ukrainians’ unity and solidarity.  No one has done more to intensify Ukrainians’ determination to write their own future on their own terms.

Ukraine will never be Russia.  Ukraine stands sovereign, independent, firmly in control of its own destiny.  In this – Putin’s primary goal – he has failed most spectacularly.

President Putin constantly claims that the United States, Europe, and countries that support Ukraine are bent on defeating or destroying Russia, on toppling its government, on holding back its people.  That is false. We do not seek the overthrow of the Russian Government and we never have.  Russia’s future is for Russians to decide.

We have no quarrel with the Russian people, who had no say in starting this tragic war.  We lament that Putin is sending tens of thousands of Russians to their deaths in a war he could end now, if he chose – and inflicting ruinous impact on Russia’s economy and its prospects.  Indeed, it must be asked:  How has Putin’s war improved the lives, the livelihoods, or the prospects of ordinary Russian citizens?

Everything that we and our allies and partners do in response to Putin’s invasion has the same purpose: to help Ukraine defend its sovereignty, its territorial integrity and independence, and to stand up for the international rules and principles that are threatened by Putin’s ongoing war.

Let me say this directly to the Russian people:  The United States is not your enemy.  At the peaceful end of the Cold War, we shared the hope that Russia would emerge to a brighter future, free and open, fully integrated with the world.  For more than 30 years, we worked to pursue stable and cooperative relations with Moscow, because we believed that a peaceful, secure, and prosperous Russia is in America’s interests – indeed, in the interests of the world.  We still believe that today.

We cannot choose your future for you, and we won’t try to do so.  But we also will not let President Putin impose his will on other nations.  Moscow must treat the independence, the sovereignty, the territorial integrity of its neighbors with the same respect that it demands for Russia.

Now, as I’ve made clear, by virtually every measure, President Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has been a strategic failure.  Yet while Putin has failed to achieve his aims, he hasn’t given up on them.  He’s convinced that he can simply outlast Ukraine and its supporters, sending more and more Russians to their deaths, inflicting more and more suffering on Ukraine’s civilians.  He thinks that even if he loses the short game, he can still win the long game.  Putin is wrong about this, too.

The United States – together with our allies and partners – is firmly committed to supporting Ukraine’s defense today, tomorrow, for as long as it takes.  And in America, this support is bipartisan.  And precisely because we have no illusions about Putin’s aspirations, we believe the prerequisite for meaningful diplomacy and real peace is a stronger Ukraine, capable of deterring and defending against any future aggression.

We’ve rallied a formidable team around this effort.  With Secretary of Defense Austin’s leadership, more than 50 countries are cooperating through the Ukraine Defense Contact Group.  And we’re leading by the power of our example, providing tens of billions of dollars in security assistance to Ukraine with robust and unwavering support from both sides of the aisle in our Congress.

Today, America and our allies and partners are helping meet Ukraine’s needs on the current battlefield while developing a force that can deter and defend against aggression for years to come.  That means helping build a Ukrainian military of the future, with long-term funding, a strong air force centered on modern combat aircraft, an integrated air and missile defense network, advanced tanks and armored vehicles, national capacity to produce ammunition, and the training and support to keep forces and equipment combat-ready.

That also means Ukraine’s membership in NATO will be a matter for Allies and Ukraine – not Russia – to decide.  The path to peace will be forged not only through Ukraine’s long-term military strength, but also the strength of its economy and its democracy. This is at the heart of our vision for the way forward:  Ukraine must not only survive, it must thrive.  To be strong enough to deter and defend against aggressors beyond its borders, Ukraine needs a vibrant, prosperous democracy within its borders.

That’s the path the Ukrainian people voted for when they won their independence in 1991.  It’s the choice they defended in the Maidan in 2004, and again in 2013: a free and open society, with respect for human rights and the rule of law, fully integrated with Europe, where all Ukrainians have dignity and the opportunity to realize their full potential – and where the government responds to the needs of its people, not those of vested interests and elites.

We are committed to working with allies and partners to help Ukrainians make their vision a reality.  We’ll not only help Ukraine rebuild its economy, but reimagine it, with new industries, trade routes, supply chains connected with Europe and with markets around the world.  We’ll continue to bolster Ukraine’s independent anti-corruption bodies, a free and vibrant press, civil society organizations.  We’ll help Ukraine overhaul its energy grid – more than half of which has been destroyed by Russia – and do it in a way that’s cleaner, more resilient, and more integrated with its neighbors, so that Ukraine can one day become an energy exporter.

Ukraine’s greater integration with Europe is vital to all of these efforts.  Kyiv took a giant step in that direction last June, when the union formally granted Ukraine EU candidate status.  And Kyiv is working to make progress toward the EU’s benchmarks even as it fights for its survival.

Investing in Ukraine’s strength is not at the expense of diplomacy.  It paves the way for diplomacy.  President Zelenskyy has said repeatedly that diplomacy is the only way to end this war, and we agree.  In December, he put forward a vision for a just and lasting peace.  Instead of engaging on that proposal or even offering one of his own, President Putin has said there is nothing to talk about until Ukraine accepts, and I quote, “new territorial realities” – in other words, accept Russia’s seizure of 20 percent of Ukraine’s territory.  Putin spent the winter trying to freeze Ukrainian civilians to death, and then the spring trying to bomb them to death.  Day after day, Russia rains down missiles and drones on Ukrainian apartment buildings, schools, hospitals.

Now, from a distance, it’s easy to become numb to these and other Russian atrocities, like the drone strike last week on a medical clinic in Dnipro, which killed four people, including doctors; or the 17 strikes on Kyiv in the month of May alone, many using hypersonic missiles; or the missile attack in April on the city of Uman – hundreds of miles from the front lines – in which 23 civilians were killed.  The rocket strike hit multiple apartment buildings in Uman before dawn.  In one of those buildings, a father, Dmytro, raced to the room where his children were sleeping – Kyrylo, age 17; Sophia, age 11.  But when he opened the door to their bedroom, there was no room, just fire and smoke.  His children were gone.  Two more innocent lives extinguished.  Two of the six children Russia killed in a single strike.  Two of the thousands of Ukrainian children killed by Russia’s war of aggression.  Thousands more have been wounded, and thousands beyond that have been abducted from their families by Russia and given to Russian families.  Millions have been displaced.  All are part of a generation of Ukrainian children terrorized, traumatized, scarred by Putin’s war of aggression, all of whom remind us why Ukrainians are so fiercely committed to defending their nation and why they deserve – deserve – a just and lasting peace.

Now, some have argued that if the United States truly wanted peace, we’d stop supporting Ukraine, and then if Ukraine truly wanted to end the war, it would just cut its losses and give up the fifth of its territory that Russia illegally occupies.  Let’s play this out for a minute.  What neighbors of Russia would feel confident in their own sovereignty and territorial integrity if Putin’s aggression were to be rewarded with a fifth of Ukraine’s territory?

And for that matter, how would any country that lives near a bully, with a history of threats and aggression, feel secure within its own borders?   What lesson will other would-be aggressors around the world learn if Putin is allowed to violate a core tenet of the UN Charter with impunity?   And how often in history have aggressors who seize all or part of a neighboring country been satisfied and stopped there?  When has that ever satisfied Vladimir Putin?

The United States has been working with Ukraine – and allies and partners around the world – to build consensus around the core elements of a just and lasting peace.  To be clear, the United States welcomes any initiative that helps bring President Putin to the table to engage in meaningful diplomacy.  We’ll support efforts – whether by Brazil, by China, or any other nation – if they help find a way to a just and lasting peace, consistent with the principles of the United Nations Charter.

Here’s what that means.

A just and lasting peace must uphold the UN Charter and affirm the principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity, and independence.

A just and lasting peace requires Ukraine’s full participation and assent – nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.

A just and lasting peace must support Ukraine’s reconstruction and recovery, with Russia paying its share.

A just and lasting peace must address both accountability and reconciliation.

A just and lasting peace can open a pathway to sanctions relief connected to concrete actions, especially military withdrawal.  A just and lasting peace must end Russia’s war of aggression.

Now, over the coming weeks and months, some countries will call for a ceasefire.  And on the surface, that sounds sensible – attractive, even.  After all, who doesn’t want warring parties to lay down their arms?  Who doesn’t want the killing to stop?

But a ceasefire that simply freezes current lines in place and enables Putin to consolidate control over the territory he’s seized, and then rest, re-arm, and re-attack – that is not a just and lasting peace.  It’s a Potemkin peace.  It would legitimize Russia’s land grab.  It would reward the aggressor and punish the victim.

If and when Russia is ready to work for true peace, the United States will respond in concert with Ukraine and other allies and partners around the world.  And along with Ukraine and allies and partners, we would be prepared to have a broader discussion on European security that promotes stability and transparency and reduces the likelihood of future conflict.

In the weeks and months ahead, the United States will continue to work with Ukraine, with our allies and partners – and any and all parties dedicated to supporting a just and lasting peace based on these principles.

On April 4, 1949, 74 years to the day before Finland joined NATO, the original members of the Alliance gathered in Washington to sign its founding treaty.  President Truman warned the group, and I quote, “We cannot succeed if our people are haunted by the constant fear of aggression and burdened by the cost of preparing their nations individually against attack.  [W]e hope to create a shield against aggression and the fear of aggression – a bulwark which will permit us to get on with the real business of . . . achieving a fuller and happier life for all our citizens.”

The same is true today.  No nation – not Ukraine, not the United States, not Finland, Sweden, any other country can deliver for its people if it lives in constant fear of aggression.  That’s why we’ve all got a stake in ensuring that President Putin’s war of aggression against Ukraine continues to be a strategic failure.

In his New Year’s address to the Finnish people, President Niinistö identified one of the fundamental flaws of President Putin’s plan to swiftly conquer Ukraine – a flaw that also doomed Stalin’s plan to swiftly conquer Finland.  As President Niinistö said, and I quote, “As leaders of a country under authoritarian rule, Stalin and Putin failed to recognize . . . that people living in a free country have their own will and convictions.  And that a nation that works together constitutes an immense force.”

Finns have a word for that fierce combination of will and determination: sisu.  And they recognize sisu in the struggle of Ukrainians today.  And when a free people like the Ukrainians have at their backs the support of free nations around the world – nations who recognize their fates and freedom – their rights and security are inextricably bound together, the force they possess is not merely immense.  It is unstoppable.

Thank you very much.  (Applause.)

NATO Headquarters

Brussels, Belgium

November 13, 2024

SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Well, good morning, everyone.  First, it’s a pleasure as always to be back at NATO.  We had very good discussions with the secretary general, Mark Rutte – delighted to see him at the helm of the Alliance in this critical moment – as well as with all of our NATO colleagues at the North Atlantic Council.

The purpose of this visit is to focus our efforts on ensuring that Ukraine has the money, the munitions, and the mobilized forces to fight effectively in 2025 or to be able to negotiate a peace from a position of strength.  And this is a critical moment because we see, first, the ongoing Russian onslaught against Ukraine in the east as well as against civilians, against critical energy infrastructure.  We see now the introduction of North Korean forces into the fight, and this is a profound and incredibly dangerous development in two ways – first, of course, because it’s adding fuel to the fire for Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, and that’s of deep concern to everyone around the NATO table.  But it’s also a two-way street.  The relationship between Russia and North Korea is working in both directions, and there is deep concern about what Russia is or may be doing to strengthen North Korea’s capacities – its missile capacity, its nuclear capacity – as well as the experience that the North Korean forces are getting in their efforts to support Russia against Ukraine.

So there is a clear commitment that this gets – and it will get – a firm response from the Alliance, from many countries that are concerned both in the Euro-Atlantic theater and in the Indo-Pacific.

As we’re working to make sure that Ukraine has what it needs to effectively defend itself, the United States continues to step up.  We’ve obligated just recently and pushed out the door another $8 billion in security assistance for Ukraine – that was in September, another almost half a billion dollars just a few weeks ago, and President Biden has committed to making sure that every dollar we have at our disposal will be pushed out the door between now and January 20th.  We’re making sure that Ukraine has the air defenses it needs, that has the artillery it needs, that has the armored vehicles it needs.

But as always, this is not just the United States.  We have more than 50 countries working actively in support of Ukraine.  And as I said before, this is maybe the best example of burden sharing that I’ve ever seen in 32 years that I’ve been doing this.  The United States has dedicated about a hundred billion dollars to Ukraine, allies and partners around the world $150 billion, and we continue to see that every day.

But it’s also a moment for everyone to do more, and we’re counting on European partners and others to strongly support Ukraine’s mobilization with training and equipment for these forces.  We need to see more artillery, more air defenses, more munitions getting to the Ukrainians, and we had a good conversation about all the work that allies and partners will be doing to step up to this moment as well.

It’s also more broadly an important moment for the Alliance, and we discussed this with the secretary general and with our colleagues around the North Atlantic Council.  We’ll be looking in the weeks ahead at the strategy that NATO has for dealing with Russia and particularly making sure that we have the strongest possible defense and deterrence.  We’ll be looking at what we’re doing to deal with some of the challenges posed by China, including the support that China is giving to Russia in the war of aggression through its support for Russia’s defense industrial base.  We’ll be looking at the challenge of hybrid threats, including those coming from Russia.

All of this is front and center in our agenda, but today the focus was intensely on what we’re doing and what we’re doing together to make sure that Ukraine is in the strongest possible position heading into 2025.

Finally, this.  As we were looking at the state of our Alliance – not just in the struggle with Russia for Ukraine but more broadly – I think we can say that we have an Alliance that is stronger, bigger, more effective than it’s ever been as a result of the work of the last four years.  And the ongoing importance of making sure that we have a strong NATO – one that we’re engaged in, invested in, and helping to lead – I think could not be more vital than it is now.

Here’s what we know, here’s what we know from history over these last 75 years, and here’s what we know looking forward.  The best way to defend ourselves, to prevent wars, to have security, is through the investments we’re making in NATO and in our other alliances and partnerships.  NATO in particular is founded on this principle:  An attack on one is an attack on all.  And that means that any would-be aggressor, anyone looking to take the fight to a NATO country, knows that if they do that, they have to take on all NATO countries.  That is the strongest possible deterrent to war.  It’s the best way to prevent war in the first place.  It’s the best way to ensure our security.  And that’s why it’s so vital that we continue to invest in this extraordinary Alliance and continue to lead in this extraordinary Alliance.

Happy to take some questions.

MODERATOR:  Nike Ching.

QUESTION:  Good morning, Mr. Secretary.

SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Good morning.

QUESTION:  Several questions for you if you may indulge me.  On Ukraine, is there any development on lifting restrictions on long-range fire?  What can the U.S. realistically do to improve the situation in Ukraine in the remaining time you have that cannot be easily undone?  Are there any new ideas you hope to implement, and can you also outline specific actions the U.S. and NATO Allies do in response to North Korea’s direct support for Russia’s war in Ukraine?

On Gaza, many humanitarian organizations are saying the situation in Gaza has actually gotten worse since you sent your letter 30 days ago and that Israel has failed to address several of the listed concerns.  Moving forward, what motivation will Israel have to improve the conditions on the ground when you fail to follow through on your previous warnings?  Thank you.

SECRETARY BLINKEN:  Thanks very much.  So on Ukraine, as I said, the President is determined that we push every dollar out the door that we have at our disposal, notably from the $61 billion supplemental that was passed on a bipartisan basis by Congress some months ago, and we’re on track to do exactly that.  So the drawdowns that we can do from our military equipment, they will go forward.  Obligating funds, that will go forward.  And that should ensure that Ukraine continues to receive from us what it needs.

But equally important is the work of our allies and partners.  And as I said, we have 50 countries that have been acting in support of Ukraine.  And I am convinced from the conversations we had today and the conversations we have virtually every day that that support will continue.  And not only continue; I expect it to increase and that our partners will continue to more than pick up their share of the burden.  So that’s critical.

In terms of exactly what we’re doing, I’ve said this before, I’ll say it again:  Every month that we’ve been engaged in the defense of Ukraine since the Russian aggression we have adapted and adjusted to the needs of Ukraine as the battlefield changes, as what Russia is doing changes, as new elements are introduced – for example, the North Korean forces.  And I can tell you that we will continue to adapt and adjust, again, to make sure that Ukraine is in the strongest possible position to deal with this aggression, to deter further aggression, to effectively defend itself.

On the Middle East and on Gaza, let me be very clear about both the intent and the effect of the letter that Secretary Austin and I sent a month ago to our Israeli counterparts.  The intent was to inject a sense of urgency with Israel to take necessary steps to address the dire humanitarian situation of children, women, and men in Gaza.  The effect has been that of the 15 steps that we urged action on, Israel has taken action either in implementing or being in the process of implementing 12 of the 15 steps.

There are three big issues that still need to be addressed that come from the letter – first, making sure that when Israel engages in an operation and people have been evacuated from an area, that once that operation is done it rescind the evacuation order so that people can return and we can start to take down some of this horrific overcrowding that we’re seeing in parts of Gaza where people have been sent to.  So that’s one.

Second, we want to see along with the humanitarian assistance getting in commercial trucks getting in with commercial goods.  This is vital because so many of the things that commercial truckers bring in, including things like fruits and vegetables, are absolutely essential to the balanced nutrition for people in Gaza.  That, in turn, is critical to making sure they have the immunities they need to fight off disease, and that’s not something normally the humanitarians do.  This comes in through commercial means.  The challenge there in terms of restoring commercial trucking has been a huge problem of lawlessness and looting inside of Gaza that needs to be addressed and that we’re working on finding a solution to.  But right now there are 900 trucks that are inside of Gaza at Karem Shalom that’s backed up.  They can’t be distributed because of this looting and because of the criminality.  So it’s imperative that that be addressed.  Israel has responsibilities to do that.  We’re also working with Egypt.

And then in my judgment maybe most significant, we need to see real and extended pauses in large areas of Gaza, pauses in any fighting, any combat, so that the assistance can effectively get to people who need it.  There are huge challenges in that regard, but we’ve also seen real solutions.  The polio vaccination campaign was the one thing that’s been very successful in Gaza.  Hundreds of thousands of children got polio vaccines.  But critical to success in doing that was having extended pauses for days, not simply hours as is the case right now, to make sure that everyone bringing assistance in has the ability to bring it in and to distribute it and to have space to do that.

So we will be working on this intensely in the days ahead.  I’ll be discussing this further with President Biden.  And the responsibility that Israel has in terms of making sure that assistance to the best of its ability can get to people who need it is an ongoing responsibility.  And I believe that the steps that it’s taken over the last weeks to address what we had in our letter, those steps would not have been taken absent the letter.  But it’s also critical, as the letter made clear, that not only are these steps taken but they need to be fully implemented and they need to be sustained if they’re going to have effect.  Yes, the last month has been terrible for people.  The letter went out – already we were into October.  We’re starting to see, as I said, implementation of most of the steps that we’ve laid out.  It will take some time for them to have effect.  And again, they have to be fully implemented and they have to be sustained.  But even with that, I think it’s essential that we see things like more extended pauses.

Now, the hard, bottom-line truth is also this.  Even with all of these steps, the situation is so difficult and so dramatic that to fully redress it, to fully answer the needs of people, the best way to do that is to end the war.  And from my perspective, what we’ve seen is this:  Israel, by the standards it set itself, has accomplished the goals that it set for itself, the strategic goals it set for itself.  It was rightly determined to make sure to the best of its ability that October 7th could never happen again.  To do that, it said that it needed to dismantle the military organization of Hamas and to get the leadership that was responsible for October 7th.  It’s done both of those things.

So this should be a time to end the war.  To do that, I think we need two things fundamentally.  One is we have to make sure that the hostages come home, including the seven Americans.  We’ve been working, as you know, on trying to get an agreement on a hostage and ceasefire deal.  Hamas tragically has demonstrated that it’s not going to engage on that despite the renewed efforts we’ve made in recent weeks.  It’s one of the reasons why Qatar has told them to leave Qatar.

But we also need to make sure that we have a plan for what follows, and this is something I’ve been working on intensely in recent weeks so that if Israel decides to end the war and we find a way to get the hostages out, we also have a clear plan so that Israel can get out of Gaza and we make sure that Hamas is not going back in.

So those plans we’re moving ahead as intensely as we can to flesh them out, to put them in place.  But short of ending the war, which we believe now is the time to move to that, we have to see these humanitarian steps fully implemented, sustained, and as I said, particularly with regard to pauses having more extensive pauses.

One final thing on this.  Israel has to meet these responsibilities, and we will be tracking this every single day.  I would note though as well that it’s extraordinary to me that as from almost day one there is no focus on Hamas and almost deafening silence around the world on Hamas.  Not only has it rejected engaging on the hostage/ceasefire proposals, not only has it rejected even smaller proposals that would have cost it nothing to release a small number of hostages and actually have Palestinian prisoners released from Israeli jails in return, not only that, but a couple of weeks ago Israel said we will guarantee safe passage for every Hamas militant out of Gaza, just give us the hostages back.  And they refused.  Is anyone talking about that?  The world has been silent on that, too.

So it would be good to also see some genuine, sustained, effective pressure on Hamas to do its part to end something that it started and that the Palestinian people who are caught in this crossfire of Hamas’ initiation didn’t start and themselves are powerless to stop.

MODERATOR:  Zoriana Stepanenko.

QUESTION:  Thank you so much for giving me the floor. Secretary Blinken, you just mentioned that since Russian full-scale invasion (inaudible) in 2022 you and United States partners are adjusting to Ukraine’s current needs.  However, Ukraine has outlined its own needs in so-called victory plan (inaudible) United States leadership, and one of the needs is to lift the restrictions of using the long-range weapon inside Russian territory.  Is there any chance that you will review your current decision and finally release those restrictions, and what are the prospects?

SECRETARY BLINKEN:  So first, we’re addressing many of the needs that are laid out in the victory plan.  That’s something that we discussed with allies and partners today.  And as I said a moment ago, the hallmark of our support for Ukraine starting in February of ’22 and carrying forward to today is making sure that we’re adapting and adjusting to Ukraine’s needs as the battlefield changes, as what Russia is doing changes, where the front lines are, how the war is being conducted, how the aggression is being conducted.  And I am convinced that we will continue to adapt and adjust as necessary.

Thanks.  Thanks, everyone.
