TIME: Obviously, a lot has happened. We want to have a conversation about what your first 100 days have looked like in office. And we want to try to touch on as many different points as we can.

Trump: There’s a lot, right? A lot of things happening.

You know better than anyone that the President of the United States is the most powerful person in the world. At the same time, it seems like you are expanding the power of the presidency. Why do you think you need more power?

Well, I don't feel I'm expanding it. I think I'm using it as it was meant to be used. I feel that we've had a very successful presidency in 100 days. We've had people writing it was the best first month and best second month, and really the best third month. But that you won't know about for a little while, because it takes a little time in transition. You know, we're resetting a table. We were losing $2 trillion a year on trade, and you can't do that. I mean, at some point somebody has to come along and stop it, because it's not sustainable. We were carrying other countries on our back with, you know, with trade numbers, with horrible numbers, and we've changed it. You see the market fluctuates quite a bit. Today, it's up 1,000 or 1,200 points. It goes up and down, but that will steady out, and we're taking in tremendous amounts of money. We have, as you know, already, 25% on cars, 25% on steel and aluminum—

Mr. President, I think what we’re driving at is that you've taken congressional authority on trade and appropriations. You fired the heads of independent agencies. You're challenging the courts right now, as you know. You're using the levers of government to weaken private institutions like law firms and universities. Isn't this seizing power away from institutions and concentrating them inside the presidency?

No, I think that what I'm doing is exactly what I've campaigned on. If you look at what I campaigned on, for instance, you can talk about removing people from the country. We have to do it because Biden allowed people to come in through his open border crazy, insanity. He allowed people to come into our country that we can't have in our country. Many criminals—they emptied their prisons, many countries, almost every country, but not a complete emptying, but some countries a complete emptying of their prison system. But you look all over the world, and I'm not just talking about South America, we're talking about all over the world. People have been led into our country that are very dangerous. If you were walking down the street, and if you happen to be near one of these people, they could, they would kill you, and they wouldn't even think about it. And we can't have that in our country.

So you're not concentrating more power in the presidency?

I don't think so. I think I'm using it properly, and I'm also using it as per my election. You know, everything that I'm doing—this is what I talked about doing. I said that I'm going to move the criminals out. I saw what was happening early on when I heard that he had open borders, when I, because it was a hard thing to believe. I built hundreds of miles of wall, and then he didn't want to, and we had another, an extra hundred miles that I could have put up because I ordered it as extra. I completed the wall, what I was doing, but we have, I wanted to build additional because it was working so well. An extension. And he didn't want to do that. And when he said he wasn't going to do that, I said, “Well, he must want open borders.” There were sections that were being built. And he stopped to work on it, and I said, this guy actually wants to have open borders. That's going to be a tragedy for our country. That's going to mean that other countries will release into our country some very rough people.

We’d love to come back to immigration but maybe start with the economy. Obviously an issue you campaigned on as well. You promised that you would immediately bring down prices and usher in a golden age of America. The prices of gas and eggs have gone down, but the cost of other things remain—

The prices of groceries have gone down. The only price that hasn't gone down is the price of energy. The cost of energy, I'm sorry, well, energy has gone down, excuse me. Let me change that—is the interest rates. And interest rates have essentially stayed the same. But almost every other thing, I mean, you take a look at what's going on, and this is, we're taking in billions of dollars of tariffs, by the way. And just to go back to the past, I took in hundreds of billions of dollars of tariffs from China, and then when COVID came, I couldn't institute the full program, but I took in hundreds of billions, and we had no inflation.

But let’s focus on what is happening right now because—

We took in billions of dollars, we had no inflation. Now, if you take a look, the price of groceries are down. The price of energy is down.

Inflation remains pretty much the same. And the IMF is saying it’s going to go up.

No, Eric, you can't say what they think, because so far what I thought is right. I've been right about—

401ks are down. The Atlanta Fed says our economy is contracting -2.2% during quarter one.

Well, they may have said that, but so far, they've been, I mean, I've been right. If you look at all of the years that I've been doing this, I've been right on things. You're gonna—you're gonna have the wealthiest country we've ever had, and you're gonna have an explosion upward in the not-too-distant future. You know, I've been here now for three months, and I inherited eggs, I inherited groceries, I inherited energy. It was all going through the roof. And we had the highest inflation we've ever had as a country, or very close to it. And I believe it was the highest ever. Somebody said it's the highest in only 48 years. That's a lot, too, but I believe we had the highest inflation we've ever had. I've been here now for three months. And three months, we are taking in billions and billions of dollars from other countries that we never took in before. And that's just the start.

Well let’s talk about the tariffs. You want companies to build and make goods here in America.

Not in all cases. There are some products I really don't want to make here.

Like t-shirts?

I can’t–I can give you a list because I actually have a list, but if you want, I could give it to you.

Well, I mean, the question is, how can CEOs make long-term plans and investments if our tariff policy can change from day to day and still remains so uncertain?

How can they make long-term investments? I'll turn it around. How can they make long-term investments if our country is losing $2 trillion a year on trade?

Will you consider giving exemptions—

No wait, just so you understand. How can we sustain and how is it sustainable that our country lost almost $2 trillion on trade in Biden years, in this last year. That's not—when you talk about a company. I had the head of Walmart yesterday, right in that seat. I had the head of Walmart. I had the head of Home Depot and the head of Target in my office. And I'll tell you what they think, they think what I'm doing is exactly right.

Well, the CEOs of small businesses are saying they may not be able to last another two months with the current regime in place. Will you consider giving small businesses an exemption similar to what you've given to Big Tech?

I’d have to look at the individual business.

Would you consider it?

Our country is going to be very rich in not a long period of time. I've been doing this for three months, and if you look at the kind of numbers that we're taking in and the jobs, and if you look at, more importantly, the companies, the chip companies, the car companies, the Apple. $500 billion. Apple is investing $500 billion in building plants. They never invested in this country.

Small businesses are worried that you’re treating the Apples of the world better than you’re treating them.

No, I’m treating small businesses—small businesses will be a bigger beneficiary of what I'm doing than than the large businesses. But everybody's going to benefit.

If we still have high tariffs, whether it's 20% or 30% or 50%, on foreign imports a year from now, will you consider that a victory?

Total victory.

Why so?

Because the country will be making a fortune. Look, that's what China did to us. They charge us 100%. If you look at India—India charges 100-150%. If you look at Brazil, if you look at many, many countries, they charge—that's how they survive. That's how they got rich. Now, zero would be easy. Oh, zero would be easy, but zero, you wouldn't have any companies coming in. They're coming in because they don't want to pay the tariffs. Remember this, there are no tariffs, if they make their product here. There are no tariffs, if they make their product here. There are no tariffs. This is a tremendous success. You just don't know it yet, but this is a tremendous success what’s happening. We're taking in billions and billions of dollars, money that we never took in before. We're also, very importantly, because of that, because of the money we're taking in, those companies are going to come back and they're going to make their product here. They're going to go back into North Carolina and start making furniture again. They've already started. In Mexico, many car plants that were under construction have stopped. They're all coming into this country. We're gonna, you're gonna see car plants going at a level that you've never seen before.

Your trade adviser–

I'm also—chips. Look at Jensen.

Nvidia.

He's gonna spend $500 billion. Look at Mr. Wei from Taiwan.

Do you trust them when they say that? These businessmen who say, Oh, I'm gonna spend $500 billion.

Oh yeah. Well, I’ll tell you why I trust them. First of all, I think they’re trustworthy people. But more importantly, they have no choice, because they won't be able to pay the tariffs if they don't do it. The tariffs are bringing in the business. Remember, with all the, you know, questions you're asking about tariffs, there are no tariffs when you make your product here.

Sure, no, I understand, Mr. President—

Zero.

Your trade adviser, Peter Navarro, says 90 deals in 90 days is possible. We're now 13 days into the point from when you lifted the reciprocal, the discounted reciprocal tariffs. There's zero deals so far. Why is that?

No, there’s many deals.

When are they going to be announced?

Advertisement

You have to understand, I'm dealing with all the companies, very friendly countries. We're meeting with China. We're doing fine with everybody. But ultimately, I've made all the deals.

Not one has been announced yet. When are you going to announce them?

I’ve made 200 deals.

You’ve made 200 deals?

100%.

Can you share with whom?

Because the deal is a deal that I choose. View it differently: We are a department store, and we set the price. I meet with the companies, and then I set a fair price, what I consider to be a fair price, and they can pay it, or they don't have to pay it. They don't have to do business with the United States, but I set a tariff on countries. Some have been horrible to us. Some have been okay. Nobody's been great. Nobody's been great. Everybody took advantage of us. What I'm doing is I will, at a certain point in the not too distant future, I will set a fair price of tariffs for different countries. These are countries—some of them have made hundreds of billions of dollars, and some of them have made just a lot of money. Very few of them have made nothing because the United States was being ripped off by every, almost every country in the world, in the entire world. So I will set a price, and when I set the price, and I will set it fairly according to the statistics, and according to everything else. For instance, do they have the VAT system in play? Do they charge us tariffs? How much are they charging us? How much have they been charging us? Many, many different factors, right. How are we being treated by that country? And then I will set a tariff. Are we paying for their military? You know, as an example, we have Korea. We pay billions of dollars for the military. Japan, billions for those and others. But that, I'm going to keep us a separate item, the paying of the military. Germany, we have 50,000 soldiers—

I’m just curious, why don’t you announce these deals that you’ve solidified?

I would say, over the next three to four weeks, and we're finished, by the way.

You’re finished?

We’ll be finished.

Oh, you will be finished in three to four weeks.

I’ll be finished. Now, some countries may come back and ask for an adjustment, and I'll consider that, but I'll basically be, with great knowledge, setting—ready? We're a department store, a giant department store, the biggest department store in history. Everybody wants to come in and take from us. They're going to come in and they're going to pay a price for taking our treasure, for taking our jobs, for doing all of these things. But what I'm doing with the tariffs is people are coming in, and they're building at levels you've never seen before. We have $7 trillion of new plants, factories and other things, investment coming into the United States. And if you look back at past presidents, nobody was anywhere near that. And this is in three months.

Will you call President Xi if he doesn’t call you?

No.

You won’t?

Nope.

Has he called you yet?

Yep.

When did he call you?

He's called. And I don't think that's a sign of weakness on his behalf.

But you would think it’s a sign of weakness if you called him?

I don’t–I just look—

Well, what did he say?

If people want to–well, we all want to make deals. But I am this giant store. It's a giant, beautiful store, and everybody wants to go shopping there. And on behalf of the American people, I own the store, and I set prices, and I'll say, if you want to shop here, this is what you have to pay.

This period of uncertainty will be over in three to four weeks?

I don’t think there’s any uncertainty there. The only thing—they have an option. They don't have to shop here. They can go someplace else, but there aren't too many places they can go. You understand what I mean though?

Advertisement

Sure. Your Treasury Secretary says this situation with China is unsustainable.

Oh I agree. You mean the way it is now?

Yes.

Or the way it was before I got here?

The current moment, too, he believes is unsustainable.

Well, no, they won’t do any business here, because at 145% it's going to be very rare that you see business.

But your conversations with Xi have made you feel like we’re moving towards a more productive—

Oh, there’s a number at which they will feel comfortable. Yeah. But you can’t let them make a trillion dollars from us. You can’t let them make $750 billion. See, that’s really what’s not sustainable when China makes a trillion dollars, or a trillion one, when we have almost $2 trillion worth of, I call it loss. Some people don't, but a lot of it’s loss. I say, when you have a trade deficit of $2 trillion I consider that loss.

Mr. President, there was a period of time on April 9 when the bond market was under extreme stress and there was a risk of a financial crisis far beyond what the plummeting stock market suggested.

Advertisement

I wasn’t worried.

What did your advisers tell you, though? You were in the Oval Office with Scott Bessent and Howard Lutnick. What did they tell you to convince you to lift the reciprocal tariffs for the 90-day pause?

They didn’t tell me. I did that.

What made you decide?

It wasn’t for that reason.

It wasn’t for the bond market?

No, it wasn’t for that reason. I'm doing that until we come up with the numbers that I want to come up with. I've met with a lot of countries. I've talked on the telephone. I don’t even want them to come in.

You said the bond market was getting the yips.

The bond market was getting the yips, but I wasn’t. Because I know what we have. I know what we have, but I also know we won't have it for long if we allowed four more years of the gross incompetence. This thing was just running—it was running as a free spirit. This was—this was the most incompetent president in history.

In our interview last year, Mr. President, you committed to complying with all Supreme Court orders.

I said what?

You committed to complying with all Supreme Court orders—

Yeah.

When you and I spoke last April. Are you still committed to complying with all Supreme Court orders?

Sure, I believe in the court system.

The Supreme Court ruled 9-0 that you have to bring back Kilmar Abrego Garcia. You haven't done so. Aren’t you disobeying the Supreme Court?

Well, that’s not what my people told me—they didn’t say it was, they said it was—the nine to nothing was something entirely different.

Let me quote from the ruling. “The order properly requires the government to facilitate Abrego Garcia's release from custody in El Salvador.” Are you facilitating a release?

I leave that to my lawyers. I give them no instructions. They feel that the order said something very much different from what you're saying. But I leave that to my lawyers. If they want—and that would be the Attorney General of the United States and the people that represent the country. I don't make that decision.

Have you asked President Bukele to return him?

I haven’t, uh, he said he wouldn’t.

Did you ask him?

But I haven’t asked him positively, but he said he wouldn’t.

But if you haven't asked him, then how are you facilitating his release?

Well, because I haven't been asked to ask him by my attorneys. Nobody asked me to ask him that question, except you.

Do you believe he deserves his day in court?

I believe that they made him look like a saint, and then we found out about him. He wasn't a saint. He was MS-13. He was a wife beater and he had a lot of things that were very bad, you know, very, very bad. When I first heard of the situation, I was not happy, and then I found out that he was a person who was an MS-13 member. And in fact, he had a tattooed right on his—I'm sure you saw that—he had it tattooed right on his knuckles: MS-13. No, I believe he's a man who has got quite a past. This is no longer just a nice, wonderful man from Maryland, which people, which the fake news had me and other people for a period of time believing. Now, nobody believes that. And I think  this isa very bad—I think this is another menwomen’s sports thing for the Democrats.

Advertisement

Maybe, but Mr. President, whatever he might have done, whoever he might be affiliated with, doesn’t he deserve his day in court? Nazi saboteurs who came on our shores at Montauk during World War II had their day in court. Al Qaeda terrorists had their day in court.

I really give that to my lawyers to determine, that’s why I have them. That’s not my determination. It's something that, frankly, bringing him back and retrying him wouldn't bother me, but I leave that up to my lawyer. You could bring him back and retry him—

That’s exactly right. You could fix this simply by bringing him back and going through the legal process—

But I leave that decision to the lawyers. At this moment, they just don’t want to do that. They say we’re in total compliance with the Supreme Court.

What about the lower courts? Are you committed to complying with lower courts?

Sure. All courts.

One more question on this, sir. You took an oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution. The Constitution says the Supreme Court is the ultimate authority once they issue a ruling. If you defy them, aren't you violating your oath?

Advertisement

I'm not defying the Supreme Court. I never defy the Supreme Court. I wouldn't do that. I'm a big believer in the Supreme Court, and have a lot of respect for the Justices.

You asked President Bukele of El Salvador to build out the CECOT prison to house American citizens. You said you would love to send “homegrown criminals” there—

No, I didn’t say that. I said if it were permissible according to the law, I would like to do that, yes.

Well, do you intend to send American citizens to foreign persons?

I would love to do that if it were permissible by law. We're looking into that. When I have a person, these would be extreme cases. When I have a person that is a 28-time in and out person that goes out and tries to kill people every time he or she is out, I would have no problem with doing that whatsoever. We're talking about career criminals that are horrible people that we house and we have to take care of for 50 years while they suffer because they killed people. If you ask me whether or not I would do that, I would, but totally, and I think you have to leave this part of the sentence totally subject to it being allowed under law. And people are looking to see if it would be allowed under law. We have crime rates under Biden that went through the roof, and we have to bring those rates down. And unfortunately, those rates have been added to by the illegal immigrants that he allowed into the country.

Advertisement

Which Americans would you do that to?

I would do that to people that hit old ladies over the head with a baseball bat, for people that grab their bicycle? You saw that one where they dragged an old woman along the street on a motorcycle, a bicycle, a motorcycle, I think. People that push people into subway trains just before the train is ready to stop. You saw that? The man barely lived. Think of it. And a guy comes up to him, and from behind he pushes him. That's a serious, serious thing. People that shoot people in the back, people that are executioners. Yeah, I would have no trouble with that but subject to it being allowed by law.

Do you really want there to be gulags for American citizens in foreign countries?

Gulag? You define gulag.

Prisons like in the Soviet Union—

Look, I see where you’re coming from, from the moment this interview started, and it's fine, I don't mind. I've answered every question that can be answered by mankind or womankind, and I see where you're coming from. Rapid fire. You can't even wait for me to give you the answer. You should let me give you that final answer.

Advertisement

Go ahead, sir.

No, no, I’m not—I’m just saying, I see where you’re coming from, and you’re just so wrong. You’re so wrong. These are people that have been in jail for 20 times. They're career criminals. Do I have a problem with a career criminal that hits people with baseball bats when they're not looking, that pushes people into subways, that shoots people in the face or in the back? I have absolutely no problem with doing that, if the law allows it to be done and we're looking at it. And one of the reasons I like it is because it would be much less expensive than our prison system, and I think it would actually be a greater deterrent.

Sir, on that note, how much are we paying President Bukele for holding those prisoners?

I don’t know. I could get you the information, but we’re paying less than we would normally.

Did you personally approve those payments?

No, I didn’t.

Many of the Jan. 6 prisoners you pardoned pleaded guilty to or were convicted of violent crimes as part of the capital attack. Days before you pardoned them, J.D. Vance said “of course” you wouldn't include those who committed violence. What changed?

What changed where?

At what moment did you decide to include all of the defendants, including the ones who committed violent offenses?

Because I've watched in Portland and I watched in Seattle, and I've watched in Minneapolis, Minnesota and other places. People do heinous acts, far more serious than what took place on Jan. 6. And nothing happened to these people. Nothing. And I said, What a double standard it is. And we were talking about a very small group of people that are in your definition, most of these people should have been let out a long time ago. There's never been a group of people, maybe with one exception, I won't even go into it, one exception as a group. But there's never been a group of people that's been treated so horribly as the J6 people. You know, when I say peacefully and patriotically, nobody mentions that. When I say go peacefully and patriotically, nobody ever mentions that. Nobody mentions the fact that the unselect committee of political scum, the unselect committee, horrible people, they destroyed all evidence, they burned it, they got rid of it, they destroyed it, and they deleted all evidence. And we went in looking for evidence, and they said, I'm sorry, we don't have it anymore. It's been destroyed. If I ever did that, it would be unthinkable what you guys, what you two guys, would be doing and writing, but, you know, and nobody wants to talk about it, and you won't write about it, and nobody writes about it. It’s unbelievable, right? But people get it. I mean, people get it. They get what I'm saying, and they obviously believe it, because I had a hell of an election.

Advertisement

You campaigned on it, and you won decisively.

No and everything I campaigned. If you think of, you know, the way you ask me these questions, like, it's so serious that we're moving people out of the country. I said during the election that I'm going to move them out of the country, and that's what we're doing.

Can you talk a little bit about the budget?

Yeah. And if we didn't do it, then you two would not be safe. I guarantee it.

Some Republicans are considering raising taxes on millionaires in the package you're planning to pass that would extend your 2017 tax cuts. Do you support that idea?

Well, I’ll tell ya, I certainly don’t mind having a tax increase, and the only reason I wouldn't support it is because I saw Bush where they said, where he said “Read my lips” and he lost an election. He would have lost it anyway, but he lost an election. He got beat up pretty good. I would be honored to pay more, but I don't want to be in a position where we lose an election because I was generous, but me, as a rich person, would not mind paying and you know, we're talking about very little. We're talking about one point. It doesn't make that much difference, and yet, I could just see somebody trying to bring that up as a subject, and, you know, say, “Oh, he raised taxes.” Well, I wouldn't be, really, you know, in the true sense, I wouldn't. I'd be raising them on wealthy to take care of middle class. And that's—I love, that. I actually love the concept, but I don't want it to be used against me politically, because I've seen people lose elections for less, especially with the fake news.

Advertisement

Do you think it would help cover the cost that would be lost from getting rid of taxes on tips and some of these other proposals?

Well, that would be able to take it. See, that would be able to do it, but I would not mind personally paying more. But the concept is something that may not be acceptable to the public.

Experts estimate that the House Republican budget will result in more than $800 billion in losses to Medicaid over the next 10 years. Do you support that?

Due to what?

The House Republican budget that would cut roughly $800 billion from Medicaid.

I don’t think they’re going to cut $800 billion. They’re going to look at waste, fraud, and abuse.

So would you veto a bill if it had cuts to Medicaid?

If it was an increase, if we were deducting something from—I would, but it's waste, it's fraud and abuse is what we're looking for. And nobody minds that.

If Republicans send you a bill that cuts Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, you commit to vetoing it?

Advertisement

If it cuts it, I would not approve.

So you would veto that?

I would veto it, yeah. But they’re not going to do that.

Would you support a ban on congressional stock trading?

Well, I watched Nancy Pelosi get rich through insider information, and I would be okay with it. If they send that to me, I would do it.

You'll sign it?

Absolutely.

The FTC is currently trying Meta for maintaining an illegal monopoly by acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp. Do you think more companies need to be broken up?

It depends on the company, depends on the market, depends on what the company does. But I think that a lot of companies certainly have been looked at during the Obama and during the Biden regime certainly.

Do you think corporate monopolies have hurt average Americans?

In some cases, yeah. In some cases, not.

I’d like to ask you some questions about DOGE. You've put Elon Musk in charge of this cost-cutting operation. The question is, why is the government, through DOGE, amassing the sensitive personal information about everyday Americans, which was previously stored across different agencies, all in one place?

Advertisement

DOGE has been a very big success. We found hundreds of billions of dollars of waste, fraud, and abuse. Billions of dollars being given to politicians, single politicians based on the environment. It's a scam. It's illegal, in my opinion, so much of the stuff that we found, but I think DOGE has been a big success from that standpoint.

[An aide interrupts the interview for President Trump to take a phone call from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi]

So if we can just come back to the question before the call, which is the database that DOGE is putting together Americans’ information. Why are they doing that?

Because we want to find waste, fraud, and abuse, and want to cut our costs.

Some officials have described what DOGE is doing is creating a central kind of “God-mode” view into government databases that has been, up until now, intentionally kept separate. The idea, they say, is to basically use this information to advance your policy goals. Is this an accurate characterization?

Advertisement

No, that’s inaccurate, as you know. I mean, it’s a crazy question. We just want to find fraud, abuse. We want to find who's on the rolls that shouldn't be, who's getting paid every month by the government that shouldn't be paid. Do these people exist? In many cases, they don't, in some cases, even worse, they do. They've been getting money, and they shouldn't be.

What does your administration plan to do with information obtained by the IRS and other agencies as part of the DOGE effort?

Well, I don’t know about the IRS, because, as you know, I’m not involved in it, but we’ve found tremendous waste, fraud and abuse. Tremendous.

Will any of it be used to track down and round up migrants as part of the deportation operation?

Not that I know of, no.

Let's talk about the cuts. As you know, Mr. President, a lot of American companies do business with the government. The DOGE cuts aren't just affecting government employees. They're also affecting American businesses that provide goods and services to the federal government. There were nearly 280,000 layoffs in March across virtually every sector. Why is it better for these people to be out of jobs?

Because we have to have an efficient country. And when the country gets down to bare knuckles, you're going to see, you're going to see something the likes of which this world has never seen before. We're going to make our country strong, powerful, and very rich again. Right now, our country is not sustainable. We're being ripped off by everybody in the world, other countries, other people, other militaries, are ripping us off. We're protecting countries for no money or for very minimal money, and that wasn't supposed to happen. We're not supposed to be protecting everybody. We're supposed to be, number one, taking care of ourself, and number two, helping people when we can, helping outside people and outside countries where we can. But we've been ripped off by levels that you've never seen. European Union sounds nice, but they've been very tough. $300 billion loss. China—hundreds of billions of dollars in losses. And I can go through a list, but I don't want to, because there are many friendly countries, our friendly countries, in many cases, are worse than our enemies. And it's not a sustainable model. It's not a sustainable possibility even, that a country can go through that and Biden let it get to a level that is seriously dangerous.

Well, many Americans certainly agree with you that they want to get rid of government fraud, waste, and abuse. They want to shrink the federal—

It’s not only government. It’s deals. It's horrible deals that have been made with other countries. As an example, China has been ripping us off for many years, until I came along.  I raised, I upped tariffs on China, hundreds of billions of dollars. We've done hundreds of billions, hundreds.

But domestically, for instance, your administration blocked grants for the National Institutes of Health that funded research into infectious diseases, cancers, Alzheimer's—

Well maybe we didn't think they were right. You know, I mean, you look at the people, look at the money that was given away by others. We didn't get anything out of it.

Well what do you tell the families and people who are suffering from those diseases?

We're taking care of—we're spending a lot. I spent 58—we spent, let's see, I think $58 billion in the first term. We were spending tremendous amounts of money, and I am now, but they have to be a little bit careful. A lot of the money like Stacey Abrams got $2 billion on the environment. They had $100 in the account and she got $2 billion just before these people left—and had to do with something that she knows nothing about.

NIH is the world’s largest funder of cancer research—

Shouldn’t they be asking those questions? I could give you a list of abuse and waste and fraud, and you don't have any interest in hearing it. I mean, I just see by these questions, just wondering, with all of the bad things that have happened, with all of the things we found, you have no interest in those things. You only have an interest. So what about this? What about that? Our country is going to be strong again because of what we're doing, and this is not a sustainable model, what we're looking at. And I think very importantly, I had a great election. Won all seven swing states, won millions and millions of votes. Won millions of votes. They say it was the most consequential election in 129 years. I don't know if that's right, but it was certainly a big win, and that's despite cheating that took place, by the way, because there was plenty of cheating that took place.

In ‘24?

‘24, yeah. ‘20, of course. But ‘24 also, they tried. They tried that. They did their best. It's the only thing they're good at. But we're gonna have a great country again. Just remember, every single question you're asking, I campaigned on it. I campaigned on all the things you're talking about, all the things you're asking about, and openly campaigned. And we're given credit, even by radical left lunatics. We are given credit for that. We're given credit for saying, This is what I'm going to do. If you look at your questions, that's what I campaigned on.

Following that call, I'd love to hear a little bit about the role that you're playing on the world stage. And I think that you campaigned on that too.

It’s interesting because you see the relationship. I didn't want to wait, you know, have you leave the room, but you see the relationship. I have that relationship with many leaders. If I can stop losing 3,000 human beings a week on average, with Russia, Ukraine, it's only because of me, nobody else could have stopped it. I think we're going to do that, by the way. I think that'll be done. I think that we're going to make a deal with Iran. I think we're going to make a deal with Iran. Nobody else could do that.

You said you would end the war in Ukraine on Day One.

Well, I said that figuratively, and I said that as an exaggeration, because to make a point, and you know, it gets, of course, by the fake news [unintelligible]. Obviously, people know that when I said that, it was said in jest, but it was also said that it will be ended.

Well what’s taking so long? When do you think it will be ended?

Well, I don’t think it’s long. I mean, look, I got here three months ago. This war has been going on for three years. It's a war that would have never happened if I was president. It's Biden's war. It’s not my war. I have nothing to do with it. I would have never had this war. This war would have never happened. Putin would have never done it. This war would have never happened. Oct. 6 would have never happened. Oct. 7 would have never happened. Would have never happened. Ever. You then say, what’s taking so long? Do you hear this, Steve? The war has been raging for three years. I just got here, and you say, what's taken so long?

Advertisement

Do you think peace is still possible if Putin is President?

I think peace is possible. You say if Putin is still president?

Yeah, if Putin is President. Can there be peace if Putin is President of Russia?

I think with me as president, there's—possible, if very probable. If somebody else is president, no chance.

If Putin can make peace?

Yeah, I think Putin will.  I think Putin would rather do it a different way. I think he’d rather go and take the whole thing. And I think that because of me, I believe I'm the only one that can get this thing negotiated. And I think we’re a long way. We've had very good talks, and we're getting very close to a deal. And I don't believe anybody else could have made that deal.

Do you believe peace is possible if Zelensky is still President of Ukraine?

Yeah, I do. He is president now and I think we’re going to make a deal.

Should Ukraine give up any hope of ever joining NATO?

Advertisement

I don’t think they’ll ever be able to join NATO. I think that's been—from day one, I think that's been, that's I think what caused the war to start was when they started talking about joining NATO. If that weren't brought up, there would have been a much better chance that it wouldn’t have started.

Should Crimea go to the Russians? Should they get to keep Crimea?

Well, Crimea went to the Russians. It was handed to them by Barack Hussein Obama, and not by me. With that being said, will they be able to get it back? They've had their Russians. They've had their submarines there for long before any period that we're talking about, for many years. The people speak largely Russian in Crimea. But this was given by Obama. This wasn't given by Trump. Would it have been taken from me like it was taken from Obama? No, it wouldn't have happened. Crimea, if I were president, it would not have been taken.

Advertisement

Would it be acceptable to you in a deal if Crimea and the four other regions that Russia has taken from Ukraine would be folded into Russia under a final accommodation?

If Crimea will stay with Russia—we have to only talk about Crimea because that's the one that always gets mentioned. Crimea will stay with Russia. And Zelensky understands that, and everybody understands that it's been with them for a long time. It's been with them long before Trump came along. Again, this is Obama's war. This is a war that should have never happened. I call it the war that should have never happened.

You’ve talked about improving relations with Moscow. Are you pursuing negotiations with them on issues other than Ukraine?

No—

Like nuclear weapons stockpiles or testing?

But if a deal has happened, I can see us doing business with Ukraine and with Russia as a country.

You've talked about acquiring Greenland, taking control of  the Panama Canal, making Canada the 51st state. Maybe you're trolling a little bit on that one. I don't know.

Advertisement

Actually, no, I’m not.

Well, do you want to grow the American empire?

Well, it depends as an empire, it wasn't, these are not things that we had before, so I'd view it a little bit differently if we had the right opportunity. Yeah, I think Greenland would be very well off if they I think it's important for us for national security and even international security. I think Canada, what you said that, “Well, that one, I might be trolling.” But I'm really not trolling. Canada is an interesting case. We lose $200 to $250 billion a year supporting Canada. And I asked a man who I called Governor Trudeau. I said, ”Why? Why do you think we're losing so much money supporting you? Do you think that's right? Do you think that's appropriate for another country to make it possible, for a country to sustain and he was unable to give me an answer, but it costs us over $200 billion a year to take care of Canada?” We’re taking care of their military. We're taking care of every aspect of their lives, and we don't need them to make cars for us. In fact, we don't want them to make cars for us. We want to make our own cars. We don't need their lumber. We don't need their energy. We don't need anything from Canada. And I say the only way this thing really works is for Canada to become a state.

Steven Cheung: We’re coming up on time, about 10 minutes.

Okay, we'll move quickly then. Last note: Do you want to be remembered as a president who expanded American territory?

Wouldn’t mind.

One more question on the cuts, sir. You've made cuts to homeland security, cyber defenses, the Nuclear Security Administration, your FBI chief is pushing to shift the bureau from domestic intelligence to criminal investigation. These are programs that were set up after September 11 to prevent terrorist attacks. Are you worried that this could be making America more vulnerable to an attack?

No. America will be much stronger.

If we are attacked, do you risk being blamed for letting down our defenses?

What does that mean?

If we are subject to an attack, do you risk being blamed because of these cuts?

I think I'll be blamed no matter what. I think if I make the country unbelievably successful, which it's not now, we owe $36 trillion right? It's, you know, when you think about it, a lot of money, a lot of money, but, but no, I think I'll be, I'll be blamed whether it's successful or not. I'm used to it.

You may be right about that. UNICEF says that more than 300 children have been killed and more than 600 have been wounded since the ceasefire in Gaza broke down. Who is to blame for those deaths?

I would say that the blame for that is Biden more than anybody else, because I had, as you know, Iran was broke, and he allowed them to become rich—

More than Hamas?

There was no money for Hamas. There was no money for Hezbollah. There was no money. Iran was broke under Trump, and you know that, he knows that, broke. They had no money, and they told Hamas, we're not giving you any money. When Biden came and he took off all the sanctions, he let China and everybody else buy all the oil, Iran developed $300 billion in cash  over a four year period. They started funding terror again, including Hamas. Hamas was out of business. Hezbollah was out of business. Iran had no money under me. I blame the Biden administration, because they allowed Iran to get back into the game without working a deal.

Advertisement

You’ve begun direct talks with Iran. Are you open to meeting with Iran’s President or Supreme Leader?

Sure.

You reportedly stopped Israel from attacking Iran's nuclear sites.

That's not right.

It’s not right?

No, it’s not right. I didn’t stop them. But I didn't make it comfortable for them, because I think we can make a deal without the attack. I hope we can. It's possible we'll have to attack because Iran will not have a nuclear weapon. But I didn't make it comfortable for them, but I didn't say no. Ultimately I was going to leave that choice to them, but I said I would much prefer a deal than bombs being dropped.

Are you worried Netanyahu will drag you into a war?

No.

Let’s talk about some of the issues with universities—

By the way, he may go into a war. But we’re not getting dragged in.

The U.S. will stay out of it if Israel goes into it?

No, I didn’t say that. You asked if he’d drag me in, like I’d go in unwillingly. No, I may go in very willingly if we can't get a deal. If we don't make a deal, I'll be leading the pack.

You're planning your first major foreign trip for your second term to the Middle East next month. What are the last hurdles for Saudi Israeli normalization?

Well, what I want, and the reason I'm doing it, is because Saudi Arabia, I happen to like the people very much, and the Crown Prince and the King—I like all of them, but they've agreed to invest a trillion dollars in our economy. $1 trillion. I'm then going to Qatar, and I'm then going to UAE, and then I'm coming back, and then we're making another. I think our foreign policy has been incredible, and it was before, and it is now. You sort of got a little glimpse of it.

Are you closer to a Saudi-Israeli normalization deal than you were before?

I have very good relationships in the Middle East, and I think all over the world. I think it's—well, the smarter people understand. I have stopped—I have solved more problems in the world without asking for or getting credit.

Advertisement

This would be a big one.

Which one?

Saudi-Israeli normalization. You had the Abraham Accords, one of your, you know, historic accomplishments—

Unfortunately, they did nothing. They did nothing with the Abraham Accords. We had four countries in there, it was all set. We would have had it packed. Now we're going to start it again. The Abraham Accords is a tremendous success, but Biden just sat with it.

Can you build on it to get the Saudi-Israeli normalization deal?

Well, I tell you what: I think Saudi Arabia will go into the Abraham Accords.

Yeah?

Yeah, and by the way, I think it will be full very quickly.

It would be a big deal if that happens.

They did nothing. Oh, that will happen.

That would be a big accomplishment. The State Department said it has revoked 300 student visas, primarily because of their participation in campus protests. I want to ask you about this, Mr. President, because you emphasized free speech as a cornerstone of your campaign, you castigated efforts to suppress it. But now it looks like your administration is deporting hundreds of people for engaging in speech you don't like. Why?

Advertisement

Tremendous anti-semitism at every one of those rallies. Tremendous, and I agree with free speech, but not riots all over every college in America. Tremendous anti-semitism going on in this country.

Are you worried that you're intimidating students or chilling free speech on American campuses and elsewhere throughout the country?

No, they can protest, but they can't destroy the schools like they did with Columbia and others.

Let’s talk about one case. Are you familiar with the case of the Tufts University student Reynessa Ozturk, who was arrested by a group of plain clothes officers. Well, she has since been accused by your government of having ties to Hamas. They have not revealed any evidence. Would you direct your Department of Justice to disclose the evidence that she is connected to Hamas?

I would have no trouble with it, no. I’ll look into it, but I’m not aware of the particular event.

Advertisement

You were harshly critical of what you called the weaponization of the Justice System under Biden. You recently signed memos—

Well, sure, but you wouldn’t be—if this were Biden, well, first of all, he wouldn't do an interview because he was grossly incompetent.

We spoke to him last year, Mr. President.

Huh?

We spoke to him a year ago.

How did he do?

You can read the interview yourself.

Not too good. I did read the interview. He didn't do well. He didn't do well at all. He didn't do well at anything. And he cut that interview off to being a matter of minutes, and you weren't asking him questions like you're asking me.

Well, we appreciate that you are able and willing to answer these questions. It says something about you, Mr. President.

I am indeed. I've been answering them for years and I’ve been getting elected by bigger and bigger numbers all the time, but you didn't ask questions like this to Biden, because if you did, he would have crawled under this beautiful desk.

Advertisement

You recently signed memos calling for an investigation of Chris Krebs, a top cybersecurity official in your first term. Isn't that, though, what you accused Biden of doing to you?

I think Chris Krebs was a disgrace to our country. I think he was—I think he was terrible. By the way, I don't know him. I'm not—I don't think I ever met him. I probably saw him around. You know, I have people come in, like the other one. He came in, and he's on CNN all the time as like an expert on Trump. I have no idea who he is. And Chris Krebs the same thing. I guess he probably said he knows me, but I have no idea. And you know, oftentimes I'll have some people sitting right here, and behind them will be 10 or 15 people from their agency or their office, and they'll stand there, and then all of a sudden, I'll hear that like I'm, you know, they're all time experts in me. I know very little about Chris Krebs, but I think he was very deficient.

Advertisement

You've used threats and lawsuits, other forms of coercion—

Well, I’ve gotta be doing something right, because I've had a lot of law firms give me a lot of money.

Why is that an appropriate use of presidential power?

Well, I think it is because I think they felt that the election was rigged and stolen and they didn't want to be a part of it. You think they gave me $100 million each for nothing? You know these law firms gave me $100 million worth of work, et cetera, and other things. And do you think they gave me that because I'm a nice guy? I don't think so. They gave it to me because they knew what they did wrong and they didn't want to get involved with it. And that's okay. That's the way it works, unfortunately.

But that is an appropriate use of presidential power, you think?

Which is?

The threats and the EOs against the law firms.

They pay–these are the top firms in the world. These are the biggest, the best: Cravath, Milbank Tweed, Paul Weiss. These are the toughest, smartest firms. They don't, they don't do this unless there's a little problem or a big problem.

Advertisement

Isn't cutting a deal with them to remove a threat from you and to do pro-bono work for causes you like just a form of extortion?

I don’t think it was a threat. I think they did that because, I assume they did it because they felt they did something wrong. Otherwise they would have, we would have had a lawsuit.

You once said you weren't sure how the Civil Rights Act quote “worked out.” Would America be better without it?

I never heard of that. Nobody’s ever asked me that before.

You said it in a 2020 interview.

I don't remember having said that.

Cheung: We have time for one more question.

When we spoke to you a year ago, we asked whether you would challenge the 22nd Amendment, which limits presidents to two terms. You said, and I quote, “I'm going to serve one term. I'm going to do a great job, and I'm going to leave.” What changed?

Well, I’m serving two terms now.

You meant one in addition to the one you already served.

Advertisement

You mean one more. I have more people begging me to run again, but I haven't looked at even the possibility. But the only thing that's changed is they think I'm doing a great job, and they like the way I'm running the country. They have a border, which you didn't ask about, that's virtually totally closed. The best border we've ever had.

Border crossings are down substantially.

No, I mean, it's, it's really, people can't believe it. They interviewed some farmers, really beautiful people that lived on the other side. They were being drawn into fights and horror shows, and now, I mean, it was dangerous. One of them got very badly injured, and by an illegal migrant that came across. And they asked him, How is it now? He said, ”Thank God for Donald Trump. It's the best it's ever been. And I've lived here for 50 years.”

You recently said you were “not joking” about seeking a third term and that there were methods to do it. What methods?

Advertisement

I'd rather not discuss that now, but as you know, there are some loopholes that have been discussed that are well known. But I don't believe in loopholes. I don't believe in using loopholes.

You wouldn’t run as vice president to J.D. Vance?

I don’t know anything about, what, look, all I can say is this, I am being inundated with requests. I'm doing a good job. Great physical exam, and unlike every other president, I took the cognitive test and I aced it 100% and I bet you guys couldn't get 100% on that exam. It's a tough exam. You know, when you get into the mid questions, it gets to be pretty tricky and pretty tough, and the last questions are very tough, and I aced it. And I guarantee, I'd give you, I'd make a big, beautiful bet that you guys couldn't ace it. But anyway. But look, it's good to have you, it’s a very nasty interview. They don’t ask any of the good things.

Advertisement

One final question. Mr. President, you were showing us the new paintings you have behind us. You put all these new portraits. One of them includes John Adams. John Adams said we’re a government ruled by laws, not by men. Do you agree with that?

John Adams said that? Where was the painting?

It’s right here.

We’re a government ruled by laws, not by men? Well, I think we're a government ruled by law, but you know, somebody has to administer the law. So therefore men, certainly, men and women, certainly play a role in it. I wouldn't agree with it 100%. We are a government where men are involved in the process of law, and ideally, you're going to have honest men like me.

Thank you, Mr. President. We appreciate your time.

Thank you.

Donald Trump,NA,FULL TRANSCRIPT: Trump's exclusive 100 days broadcast interview with ABC News - ABC News,"President Donald Trump sat down with ABC News' Terry Moran in the Oval Office.

President Donald Trump exclusively sat down with ABC News on Tuesday for the first broadcast interview marking the 100-day milestone of his second term.

ABC News anchor and Senior National Correspondent Terry Moran conducted the interview from the Oval Office, which aired on ABC at 8 p.m. ET. The interview will also be streamed later Tuesday on ABC News Live, Disney+ and Hulu.

The president's first 100 days back in the White House have been marked by controversial tariffs, an overhaul of U.S. immigration enforcement and massive cuts to the federal workforce, all policies that Trump notes he campaigned on.

Read the full transcript of ABC News' milestone interview with Trump below.

TERRY MORAN: Okay. Mr. President, thank you for doing this.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Thank you very much.

TERRY MORAN: Here in the Oval Office, it's -- it's special. A hundred days into your second term. So what's the one thing, just one thing, that you think is the most significant thing you've done so far in these 100 days?

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I think maybe the border is the most significant because our country was really going bad. They were allowing people to come in from prisons, as you know. And you've heard me say it, but you've heard a lot of people say it. Prisons, mental institutions, gang members -- murderers.

We had many murderers, 11,888, they think. Some murdered more than one person. So you had murderers coming in. You had everybody coming in. And not just South America. From all over the world, they were emptying their prisons into our country.

And now it's totally closed down. And you've seen just yesterday, they announced 99.9%. Nobody thought that could happen, and it happened quickly, very quickly. And I think that's very significant. But we're doing other things that are very significant.

Results will take a little bit longer because it's one of those -- you know, it's complicated. It's -- many years of trading abuse. We've been abused by other countries for years and years. They laughed at us. They thought we were stupid people, and we're fixing it. And -- I think that's gonna be very, very important. But I -- I would --

TERRY MORAN: We have a lot of ground to cover.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah. I would really say that -- that -- that the border is so important, you know? You just can't --

TERRY MORAN: And we'll get there. Immigration is huge --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: -- let that happen. Yeah.

TERRY MORAN: And we're gonna get there. But I wanna start --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Sure.

TERRY MORAN: -- with the economy, the number one issue for so many people, for just about everybody. It -- it's one of the main reasons that you're back in this office. And now we have this trade war with China that -- that Moody's and other analysts say is gonna cost American families thousands of more dollars per year. And there is a lot of concern out there. People are worried, even some people who voted for you, sayin', ""I didn't sign up for this."" So how do you answer those concerns?

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, they did sign up for it, actually. And this is what I campaigned on. I said that-- we've been abused by other countries at levels that nobody's ever seen before. We were losing $3 to 5 billion a day on trade. We were losing-- a trillion and a half to $2 trillion a year. Not sustainable.

They were takin' advantage of us like they've never -- I could've left it that way, and at some point there would've been an implosion like nobody's ever seen. But I said, ""No, we have to fix it."" I've -- I've wanted to do this for many years.

You know, I had the best economy during my first term. We had a tremendous economy, tremendous success. And we -- we did tremendous numbers of tariffs on -- we took in a lot of money from tariffs -- China in particular, hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs. We had no inflation, as you know. We had an incredible economy. We were given credit for a great economy. But I said, ""We have to fix this, otherwise it's just not self-sustaining.""

TERRY MORAN: Well, one of the things you ran on was you'd said you'd bring prices down on day one. And that --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And I have --

TERRY MORAN: -- it would happen fast. And that it would happen fast and --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I have.

TERRY MORAN: Many -- most economists will tell you that tariffs will raise prices. So don't your tariffs cut against that promise you made to bring prices down?

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, because I had massive tariffs on China, if you remember in my first term, and we had essentially no inflation. Like, around 1% inflation, which is, like, a perfect number. The -- and then when Biden took over it went through the roof.

It went to the -- probably the worst inflation we've ever had. I mean, we had an inflation nightmare. Now, if you look at what's happening now, we're only there for 100 days, as you say, and in 100 days we took over the -- we had bad inflation for four years, for two years of -- especially two years of his -- his administration. I would say record-setting like we've never seen. They say 48 years, the worst in 48 years. I'd say it was much worse than that --

TERRY MORAN: You lived through that, I lived through that, yeah.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Right. So -- so now if you look at what's happened -- energy is down. Gasoline hit $1.98 in a few states -- during the last couple of days. It was $3.50 and $4.00 and $4.50. But gasoline is way down. And when I took over, you remember the big thing with eggs?

They hit me the first week, ""Eggs, eggs, eggs,"" like it was my fault. I said, ""I didn't cause this problem. This problem was caused by Biden. What's the problem with eggs?"" And they said, ""They've doubled it."" Well, eggs are down 87% since I got involved.

TERRY MORAN: A lotta that is bird flu, right --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And by the way -- and there were plenty of eggs for Easter, which we just went through. There were plenty of eggs for Easter. They were saying, ""You won't have enough eggs for Easter."" We ended -- our sec -- my secretary did a fantastic job on eggs. Groceries are down. Everything's down --

TERRY MORAN: Okay.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Interest rates are the same. Interest rates should be down, but we have a Federal Reserve that wants to be stubborn. They wanna be cute --

TERRY MORAN: Alright, we'll get to that. A couple -- you said something a couple weeks ago that -- that struck me. You said, concerning the tariffs, which economists say are gonna raise prices, you said, quote, ""Hang tough. It won't be easy."" You said that to the American people. Is that what Americans should expect --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I've said that --

TERRY MORAN: -- some hard times?

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I've said that during --

TERRY MORAN: Because of these tariffs--

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: -- my campaign. Look, we won a campaign by a lot. We won all seven swing states. We won the popular vote by a lot. You know, we had a tremendous campaign. I said all of these things during my campaign. I said, ""You're gonna have a transition period."" We've been ripped off by every country all over the world. They're laughing at us. They thought we were stupid people, and we were. And I said, ""That's not gonna happen. We're not gonna let that happen"" --

TERRY MORAN: Hard times -- hard times are ahead?

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I don't think so. I think great --

TERRY MORAN: ""Hang tough"" --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: -- times are ahead. Look, since I came in gasoline is down, groceries are down, egg prices are down -- many things are down, just about everything. You know, you don't have the drop in -- in fuel and energy and oil like we did. I took it from maybe $3.20, maybe more than that, down into a low -- a much lower number. When you have that kind of a drop you're not gonna have inflation.

TERRY MORAN: Not now. But it's the tariffs, right? We still have 145% tariffs --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well --

TERRY MORAN: -- on China

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Why is it --

TERRY MORAN: Your Treasury secretary said we basically have an embargo on China.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Look, you're trying to --

TERRY MORAN: And that --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: -- say something's gonna happen, Terry --

TERRY MORAN: No, no, no, no. Okay, well, do you --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Nothing's gonna happen

TERRY MORAN: You know business. I wanna ask you --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Terry -- Terry --

TERRY MORAN: I wanna ask you.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I do know business. And --

TERRY MORAN: Yeah, so 145% tariffs on China. And -- and that is --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: That's good.

TERRY MORAN: -- basically --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: That's good.

TERRY MORAN: -- an embargo

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They deserve it.

TERRY MORAN: It'll raise prices on everything from--

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They deserve it.

TERRY MORAN: -- electronics to clothing to building houses.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You don't know that. You don't know whether or not China's gonna eat it --

TERRY MORAN: That's mathematics.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: China probably will eat those tariffs. But at 145, they basically can't do much business with the United States. And they were making from us a trillion dollars a year. They were ripping us off like nobody's ever ripped us off. And by the way, we have other countries that were just as bad. If you look at the European Union, it was terrible what they've done to us. Every country, almost every country in the world was ripping us off.

TERRY MORAN: But I --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They're not doing that anymore.

TERRY MORAN: I want you to think about the boom that this country has had in small businesses, mom-and-pops -- Etsy stores, small businesses that became --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Really? They haven't had a boom --

TERRY MORAN: -- big businesses

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: -- because of inflation.

TERRY MORAN: Well, your boom, what they've done --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The boom was inflationary boom. The people were wiped out with inflation. I mean, you read the news. You do the business stuff, I assume --

TERRY MORAN: Now they face -- now they -- they -- a lot of 'em built those businesses on the trading model before you --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah, and they're gonna make more money now

TERRY MORAN: They source their products overseas. And now they're looking at an extinction event --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I've been here.

TERRY MORAN: They're -- they're -- it's disaster for them.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I've been here for three months. I've taken a trade deficit down to a number that's very, very -- starting to get really good. I only -- I just got here. We had a country that -- it was not sustainable. What Biden did to this country, between -- the open borders where criminals poured into our country, between every country in the world ripping us off on trade, it was not sustainable.

TERRY MORAN: So your message to those small businesses who are saying, ""We can't live a month, two months with these tariffs,"" Apple got a big deal. Is there something for them?

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, no. Not only Apple. We've got $7-8 trillion being invested in our country in two months. Biden didn't have that over a year. I mean, if you look at Biden, nobody was really investing in this country. Everybody was ripping off our country. Apple's putting up $500 billion, but that's only one of many companies. Companies are flooding into our country right now.

TERRY MORAN: So your answer to the concern about the tariffs is, ""Everything's gonna be hunky-dory?""

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Everybody's gonna be just fine. It wouldn't have been if I didn't do this. I had a choice. I could leave it, have a nice, easy time. But I think ultimately you would've had an implosion. Our country had inflation that was worse than they've ever had it before.

You don't mention that. Why don't you mention that? We had the worst inflation probably in the history of our country. People say 48 years, probably in the history of our country we had the worst inflation. And people were dying over the inflation. You know that. Now the grocery prices are coming down. The energy prices are coming down. Gasoline's coming down. It's all heading in the right direction.

TERRY MORAN: Okay. Let's move on to immigration. And as you said, it is an undeniable fact that illegal crossings at the southern border have plummeted, a staggering decline. But there are questions about your methods, and so I want to ask you --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: About my message?

TERRY MORAN: Methods. About your methods, how you're accomplishing this --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, they seem to work.

TERRY MORAN: Do you acknowledge that under our law every single person who gets deported gets a hearing first to make their case?

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, are we talking about people that are citizens of our country or not?

TERRY MORAN: No, you're not deporting citizens, at this point.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, lemme ask you. Do they get hearings when -- when Biden allowed 21 million -- 'cause I think the number's 21, 20 million -- people to flow into our country? He had 21 million people that came into our country through a stupid open border.

And they were prisoners and they were -- people that you don't want, in many cases, in our country, right? They came from all over the world. They came from the Congo. They came from south -- they came from all over the world. We're talkin' about some of the roughest countries in the world -- they had -- they had here, including terrorists, by the way. Now --

TERRY MORAN: But the law --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Did we give them a hearing when they came in?

TERRY MORAN: Well, the law requires that every single person who is going to be deported gets a hearing first.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well --

TERRY MORAN: Do you acknowledge that?

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I'll -- I'll have to ask the lawyers about that. All I can say is this: If you're gonna have 21 million people, and if we have to get a lot of 'em out because they're criminals, we're gonna have to act fast. We can't -- do you think we can give 21 million trials? Let's say each trial takes two weeks. Is that what you want us to do --

TERRY MORAN: The law is the law, sir --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: -- give 21 million?

TERRY MORAN: The law is the law and you're sworn --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, no. The law doesn't say anything --

TERRY MORAN: -- to uphold it --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: -- about trials

TERRY MORAN: No, not trials. Hearings. I said hearings --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: If these people came in, they're not citizens, they came in illegally, they came into our country illegally, we have to --

TERRY MORAN: And they --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: -- get them out.

TERRY MORAN: There's a legal process for that.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I can't -- sure, and we follow the legal process. I can't -- I can't have a trial-- a major trial-- for every person that came in illegally, we have thousands of murderers that came in. They're gonna murder people. They already have murdered people in our country.

TERRY MORAN: Right, so --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We have to get 'em out--

TERRY MORAN: They're bad guys --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And we have to get 'em out fast.

TERRY MORAN: Really bad guys. But in our country even bad guys get due process, right?

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: If people come into our country illegally there's a different standard. These are illegal. They came in illegally.

TERRY MORAN: But they get due process.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, they get a process where we have to get 'em out, yeah.

TERRY MORAN: Okay. Let's talk about the Venezuelans.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They get whatever my lawyers say.

TERRY MORAN: Right. Alright, let's talk about the Venezuelans. You deported more than 200 Venezuelans to that prison in El Salvador. You -- you say they're -- they're violent. They're gang members. They're terrorists. Many of them don't have -- a criminal record --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They are, by the way.

TERRY MORAN: -- at all.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well -- I'm not so sure about that, if you take a look --

TERRY MORAN: I wanna -- I wanna read you something --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: When you -- excuse me. When you look at those -- those people, they were violent people. They were violent people --

TERRY MORAN: But many of them don't have a criminal record at this point --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Go ahead.

TERRY MORAN: I wanna read you something --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I mean, that's what you say.

TERRY MORAN: Well, it's based on -- their lawyer-- what their lawyers have said --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Go ahead. Go ahead.

TERRY MORAN: Joe Rogan said this. Joe Rogan, one of the leading podcasters, Trump supporter, about the deportation of Venezuelans. He said, quote, ""Rounding up gang members and shipping them to El Salvador with no due process,"" he said it was dangerous and added, quote, ""We gotta be careful that we don't become monsters while we're fighting monsters."" I -- is Joe Rogan --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I agree with that.

TERRY MORAN: -- right?

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Oh, I agree with that a hundred percent, yeah. We want to be careful. We are careful. We're doing something that has to be done. We have a country that's very sick. Joe Biden -- and it's not him, because I don't even think he knew what the hell was happening.

But the people around him are vicious people. And what they've done to the country is unbelievable. They've allowed 21 million people to pour into our country. Many of these people are criminals. They've allowed the -- you mention Venezuela -- the jails of Venezuela to be emptied into the United States.

Do you know Venezuela crime is way down? Way, way down. You know why? Because their criminals are now living happily in the United States of America, and we're getting 'em out. And I was elected to get 'em out, and we're getting 'em out --

TERRY MORAN: Under the law, it sounds like --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: -- getting them out fast, and we're getting them out legally. Now in some cases, we have judges. In some cases, they're radical left judges. What happened the other day, where a judge was protecting a criminal, was horrible.

TERRY MORAN: Mmm.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And I think she's got big problems, frankly --

TERRY MORAN: Probably. And talk about --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And there are a couple of them like that.

TERRY MORAN: I want to talk about one man --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Wait a minute.

TERRY MORAN: Yep.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We have to be treated fairly by judges. And we're not being treated fairly by all judges.

TERRY MORAN: Oh, that's a subject its -- so you're saying that you don't like some of the rulings, some of the --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I think --

TERRY MORAN: -- court orders?

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think the rulings will be overturned, yeah.

TERRY MORAN: Alright. Well, let me ask about one man and one court order. Kilmar Abrego Garcia. He's the Salvadoran man who crossed into this country illegally but who is under a protective order that he not be sent back to El Salvador. Your government sent him back to El Salvador and acknowledged in court that was a mistake. And now the Supreme Court has upheld an order that you must return him to the -- facilitate his return to the United States. What are you doing to comply?

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, the lawyer that said it was a mistake was here a long time, was not appointed by us -- should not have said that, should not have said that. And just so you understand --

TERRY MORAN: Said it in court. Said it in court --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: -- the person that you're talkin' about, you know, you're makin' this person sound -- this is a MS-13 gang member, a tough cookie, been in lots of skirmishes, beat the hell out of his wife, and the wife was petrified to even talk about him, okay? This is not an innocent, wonderful gentleman from Maryland --

TERRY MORAN: I'm not saying he's a good guy. It's about the rule of law. The order from the Supreme Court stands, sir --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: He came into our country illegally.

TERRY MORAN: You could get him back. There's a phone on this desk.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I could.

TERRY MORAN: You could pick it up, and with all --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I could

TERRY MORAN: -- the power of the presidency, you could call up the president of El Salvador and say, ""Send him back,"" right now.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And if he were the gentleman that you say he is, I would do that.

TERRY MORAN: But the court has ordered you --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But he's not.

TERRY MORAN: -- to facilitate that -- his release--

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I'm not the one making this decision. We have lawyers that don't want --

TERRY MORAN: You're the president.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: -- to do this, Terry --

TERRY MORAN: Yeah, but the -- but the buck stops in this office --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I -- no, no, no, no. I follow the law. You want me to follow the law. If I were the president that just wanted to do anything, I'd probably keep him right where he is --

TERRY MORAN: The Supreme Court says what the law is.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Listen. I was elected to take care of a problem that was -- it was -- a, a unforced error that was made by a very incompetent man, a man that turned out to be incompetent that you always said was wonderful, a great genius, right? And now you find out -- all of the media, now they're saying what a mistake they made. A man who was grossly incompetent allowed us to have open borders where millions of people flowed in --

TERRY MORAN: Alright.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I campaigned on that issue. I wouldn't say it was my number one issue, but it was pretty close.

TERRY MORAN: Right up there.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I campaigned on that issue. I've done an amazing job. I have closed borders. He said you couldn't do it, you wouldn't be able to do it, it would never happen. Well, it happened. And it happened --

TERRY MORAN: Alright.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: -- very quickly. Wait a minute. When we have criminals, murderers, criminals in this country, we have to get 'em out. And we're doing it.

TERRY MORAN: By law --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And you'll pick out one man, but even the man that you picked out --

TERRY MORAN: He's got --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: -- he said he'd -- wasn't a member of a gang. And then they looked, and --

TERRY MORAN: Alright.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: On his knuckles -- he had MS-13 --

TERRY MORAN: Alright. There's dis -- there's a dispute over that --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, wait a minute. Wait a minute. He had MS-13 --

TERRY MORAN: Well --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: -- on his knuckles tattooed.

TERRY MORAN: -- he -- he -- he -- it didn't say-- oh, he had some tattoos that are inper -- interpreted that way. But let's move on

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Wait a minute.

TERRY MORAN: I want --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Hey, Terry. Terry. Terry.

TERRY MORAN: He -- he did not have the letter --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Don't do that -- M-S-1-3 -- It says M-S-one-three.

TERRY MORAN: I -- that was Photoshop. So let me just--

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: That was Photoshop? Terry, you can't do that -- he had --

-- he-- hey, they're givin' you the big break of a lifetime. You know, you're doin' the interview. I picked you because -- frankly I never heard of you, but that's okay --

TERRY MORAN: This -- I knew this would come --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But I picked you -- Terry -- but you're not being very nice. He had MS-13 tattooed --

TERRY MORAN: Alright. Alright. We'll agree to disagree. I want to move on --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Terry.

TERRY MORAN: -- to something else.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Terry. Do you want me to show the picture?

TERRY MORAN: I saw the picture. We'll -- we'll -- we'll agree to disagree --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Oh, and you think it was Photoshop. Well --

TERRY MORAN: Here we go. Here we go.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: -- don't Photoshop it. Go look --

TERRY MORAN: Alright.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: -- at his hand. He had MS-13 --

TERRY MORAN: Fair enough, he did have tattoos that can be interpreted that way. I'm not an expert on them.

I want to turn to Ukraine, sir --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, no. Terry --

TERRY MORAN: I-- I want to get to Ukraine--

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Terry, no, no. No, no. He had MS as clear as you can be. Not ""interpreted."" This is why people --

TERRY MORAN: Alright.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: -- no longer believe --

TERRY MORAN: Well.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: -- the news, because it's fake news --

TERRY MORAN: When he was photographed in El Sal -- in-- in El Salvador, they aren't there. But let's just go on --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: He is --

TERRY MORAN: They aren't there when he's in El Salvador.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --there -- oh, oh, they weren't there --

TERRY MORAN: Take a look at the photograph --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But they're there now, right?

TERRY MORAN: No. What --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But they're there now?

TERRY MORAN: They're in your picture.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Terry.

TERRY MORAN: Ukraine, sir.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: He's got MS-13 on his knuckles.

TERRY MORAN: Alright. I --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Okay?

TERRY MORAN: -- we'll -- we'll take a look at it --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It's -- it's -- you do such a disservice --

TERRY MORAN: We'll take a look. We'll take a look at that, sir --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Why don't you just say, ""Yes, he does,"" and, you know, go on to something else --

TERRY MORAN: It's contested. Ukraine. I want to turn -- I was just in Rome, and to that moving photograph of you and President Zelenskyy sitting in St. Peter's Basilica --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah.

TERRY MORAN: -- talking peace. It went around the world.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Sure.

TERRY MORAN: Take us into that moment.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, look, the Ukraine is a very serious, very tough situation. And this is Biden's war. This is not my war. But I want to see if I can solve it, because probably close to 5,000 young soldiers a week are being killed, Russian and Ukrainian. We also spend a tremendous amount of money in Ukraine, and Europe should be spending much more than us. They're not. They're spending much less. It's been badly handled by the Biden administration. It's been badly handled all the way around, all the way around --

TERRY MORAN: But that -- that moment.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The moment was a moment of solace in a sense, because -- tremendous numbers of people are dying. A lot of his people are dying. They're being killed. And I feel very badly about it. I feel very badly about -- that's a war that would have never happened if I were president, and it didn't happen for four years. It was never even a thought of it happening.

TERRY MORAN: It -- it does feel like something's happening. After that meeting with Zelenskyy in St. Peter's, you posted this on social media. ""There was no reason for Putin to be shooting missiles into civilian areas, in cities and towns, over the last few days. It makes me think that maybe"" --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah, well, that was part of my post. But you're right. That was -- that was part of a post, yes --

TERRY MORAN: And it says, ""It makes me think that maybe he doesn't want to stop the war. He's just tapping me along--""

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It's possible. Yeah, that's possible. Sure.

TERRY MORAN: ""He might be --""

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: He could be tapping me along a little bit. I would say that he would like to stop the war. I think that --

TERRY MORAN: You believe that?

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: -- if -- if it weren't for me, I think he'd want to take over the whole country, personally. I always felt -- so when I left, there wasn't even a chance that this would happen. When Biden got involved, I won't say whether or not he handled it properly, but obviously it wasn't good, because the war started.

Putin went in. The war started. I believe that Putin wanted to get all of Ukraine once he went in. And I think part of the reason he went in is he saw what happened in Afghanistan, how incompetent -- how incompetently Milley and all these guys handled that. It was one of the greatest embarrassments of -- of our lifetimes but maybe in the history of our country. Okay. So Putin went in. I think Putin wanted all of Ukraine.

TERRY MORAN: Right.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think if I didn't win the election, he would have gotten all of Ukraine. I think he would have taken all of Ukraine.

TERRY MORAN: From --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think his first choice -- never with me. He would have never gone in. With this group of losers, he went in. He saw what happened in Afghanistan. He said, ""Wow, this is my chance,"" because it was always the apple of his eye. I talked to him. Ukraine was the apple of his eye. I think he wanted the whole country.

TERRY MORAN: You've said for months that --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And because of me, I do believe that --

TERRY MORAN: Yeah. Yeah.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: -- he's willing to stop the fighting. Don't forget --

TERRY MORAN: You think he wants peace?

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: -- this is --

TERRY MORAN: You think Vladimir Putin wants peace?

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think he does, yes. I think he does--

TERRY MORAN: Still?

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think because of me --

TERRY MORAN: Even with the raining missiles on --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think he really -- his -- his -- his dream was to take over the whole country. I think because of me, he's not gonna do that.

TERRY MORAN: Do you trust him?

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think --

TERRY MORAN: Do you trust him?

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I don't trust you. I don't trust -- I don't trust a lot of people. I don't trust you. Look at you. You come in all shootin' for bear. You're so happy to do the interview.

TERRY MORAN: I am happy --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And then you start hitting me with fake questions. You start tellin' me that a guy -- whose hand is covered with a tattoo --

TERRY MORAN: Alright. We're back to that.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: -- doesn't have the tattoo, you know.

TERRY MORAN: Alright.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I mean, you're being dishonest.

TERRY MORAN: No, I'm not --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Let -- let-- let me just tell you --

TERRY MORAN: No, I am not, sir.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Do I trust -- I don't trust a lot of people. But I do think this. I think that he -- let's say he respects me. And I believe because of me he's not gonna take over the whole -- but his decision, his choice would be to take over all of Ukraine.

TERRY MORAN: Okay.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: It's a war that never should have happened. It did happen because of incompetent people --

TERRY MORAN: Last question on this.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But it never should have happened.

TERRY MORAN: If there's no peace deal, will the U.S. cut off military aid to Ukraine?

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I don't want to tell you that. I'm not gonna tell you whether or not I would or not --

TERRY MORAN: That sounds --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I want to leave that as a big, fat secret, because I don't want to ruin a negotiation. But --

TERRY MORAN: I'd be worried if I were Ukraine.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: -- I will tell you I was not happy when I saw Putin shooting missiles into a few towns and cities. And -- that was not something that I liked seeing, and I thought it was inappropriate. But I think the whole war is inappropriate.

TERRY MORAN: Okay.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Again, it's a war that shouldn't have happened. This war is a war that if the election weren't rigged -- and it was totally rigged, the 2020 election -- if it weren't rigged, you wouldn't have that. You wouldn't have had the embarrassment --

TERRY MORAN: Okay.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: -- of Afghanistan.

TERRY MORAN: Got it.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You wouldn't have October 7th with Is --

TERRY MORAN: Got it.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --Israel. You wouldn't have had any of the problems that you have right now --

TERRY MORAN: Thank you. I want to ask one question --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And you wouldn't have had inflation either.

TERRY MORAN: Alright. I want to ask one question about Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. There's a lot of turmoil -- at the -- at the Pentagon right now. There's the Signal chat with his wife on it where he's discussing that attack in Yemen. There's another Signal chat -- discussing the attack on Yemen.

There's a reporter accidentally involved. You said the other day that you had a talk with the secretary. Did you take him to the woodshed?

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I had a talk with him, and whatever I said I probably wouldn't be inclined to tell you. Bu t-- we had a good talk. He's a talented guy. He's young. He's smart, highly educated. And I think he's gonna be a very good defense -- hopefully a great defense secretary, but he'll be a very good defense secretary --

TERRY MORAN: You have a hundred percent confidence in Pete Hegseth?

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I don't have -- a hundred percent confidence in anything, okay? Anything. Do I have a hundred percent? It's a stupid question. Look --

TERRY MORAN: It's a pretty important position.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: -- I have -- no, no, no. You don't have a hundred percent. Only a liar would say, ""I have a hundred percent confidence."" I don't have a hundred percent confidence that we're gonna finish this interview.

TERRY MORAN: We will.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Let's go.

TERRY MORAN: Elon Musk and DOGE. Everyone knows that there's wasteful government spending. It's really important. But the cuts have had some serious consequences. There have been cuts to foreign aid programs that save lives and keep people alive overseas. There's been research at the National Institutes of Health on cancer, on Alzheimer's that has had to be stopped. And- - the question I think people have is: Did DOGE go too far, too fast, too recklessly?

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, I think DOGE has been, look, saved $150 billion. Billion. We saved -- that's a lot of money. There's also a lot of things right now under investigation, which is gonna increase that amount by a lot. And that's a tremendous amount of money. There were some things where when I heard about 'em I -- I put 'em back, as you know. There are things that I'm considering right now putting back. But overall, we've saved hundreds of billions of dollars of --

TERRY MORAN: Well, the original promise was $2 trillion, went to $1 trillion. Now, it's $150 billion --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I don't know --

TERRY MORAN: -- and heading south.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You don't know what it's gonna be because we have things that are very -- at a very high level that are being looked at right now. We also found tremendous waste, fraud, and abuse, as you know.

We found a lot of fraud. There was a lot of fraud. Fraudulent things were taking place, and we ended that, and those people are gonna be suffering --

TERRY MORAN: Just --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: -- because of it.

TERRY MORAN: -- a legal note. Fraud is a crime. There have been no referrals to the Justice Department on any of this --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, you don't know that, do you? How do you know that?

TERRY MORAN: Have there been referrals --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: How do you know that --

TERRY MORAN: -- to the -- are there criminal referrals --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Why -- how would you know that, that there were no referrals? I think there--

TERRY MORAN: There's -- there's --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: -- were referrals.

TERRY MORAN: They generally -- alright. There's been no investigation from the Justice Department --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: How do you know that?

TERRY MORAN: I'm asking you, sir.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, you're not askin' me. You made a statement. You're not asking me --

TERRY MORAN: Now, I'm asking you.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: That was a statement that you made. There have been --

TERRY MORAN: Now, I'm asking.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Have there been? Yes, there have.

TERRY MORAN: So there have been referrals for fraud from the work of DOGE?

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Of course there have been. Take a look at some of these things --

TERRY MORAN: Alright. Alright.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: -- that took place. Millions of dollars were given to people for no reason whatsoever. Of course there have been.

TERRY MORAN: I want to bring up -- what is truly one of -- to a lot of people, one of the biggest achievements of your first term. That is Operation Warp Speed. You got that COVID vaccine up and going --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: That's right.

TERRY MORAN: -- and distributed. And a lotta people took it, and a lotta people that feel their lives have been saved by it. Now, we have this measles outbreak, biggest in a decade -- in Texas, and it's because people aren't getting their children vaccinated. Do you recommend to parents that they get their children vaccinated for measles?

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I recommend the governors to make the decisions. You have a very talented governor of Texas, and he's making decisions, and those decisions are gonna be made rapidly. This is a very much different thing than COVID in terms of rap -- rapidity and speed and other things.

Measles have been with us a long time. And I'm not saying good, bad, or indifferent. I'm just saying that -- the governors are making the decision. It's a federalist decision --

TERRY MORAN: So you're -- the president is -- is our leader in so many ways, and your voice counts so much. And you can't tell moms and dads, you know, it's a good thing --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Oh, sure. I rec --

TERRY MORAN: -- to get a measles vaccine?

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Do I recommend it?

TERRY MORAN: Yes.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yes, I do. I recommend it. Yeah.

TERRY MORAN: Got it. That was my question --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Do I mandate it? No.

TERRY MORAN: No. No, I didn't ask --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But I do recommend it, yes --

TERRY MORAN: Good. Do you think your --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And I have recommended it.

TERRY MORAN: Do you think the secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has a history of at the very least vaccine skepticism -- do you think Kennedy recommends the measles vaccines?

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: He did. He did. He recommended it. Yeah, he did. He recommended it --

TERRY MORAN: Are you satisfied with his --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah, I mean, he --

TERRY MORAN: -- response on this?

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: -- recommended that they go out and get the vaccine. Yeah.

TERRY MORAN: Okay. I want to talk a little bit about presidential power, the powers that you have in the presidency- - temporarily that the American people ha -- have given you, right? You've revoked a lot of people's security clearances. You've revoked people's security details who are -- still threatened, you know, with death threats. You've gone after law firms because they've employed people you don't like or they have represented people that you don't like --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, they obviously agreed because they paid me a lotta money.

TERRY MORAN: Well, the reason they agreed is because you were threatening to destroy their business with your executive order that said, ""You can't represent clients before the federal government."" That's--

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well -- These are big --

TERRY MORAN: That's their bread and butter --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: These are big boys. These are big -- these are the biggest, most powerful lawyers. These are not people that --

TERRY MORAN: You got a lotta leverage as president --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: -- are easily intimidated.

TERRY MORAN: As president, you've got all the cards.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And they paid hundreds of millions of dollars because they felt -- I guess they probably felt they did something wrong, you know --

TERRY MORAN: It was for survival, sir. You --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, it isn't. These --

TERRY MORAN: You were crushing their business --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: These -- these firms are very powerful firms, and there's 15 of them. And these are firms that -- probably-- look, you have to ask them. In fact, this is a separate story. You have to ask them, ""Why did you all pay Trump hundreds of millions of dollars in services, et cetera? Why did you do that?"" I don't know.

TERRY MORAN: You don't think that factored --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We -- we -- we have a clause in the thing that, ""While we admit no wrongdoing."" But, you know, it's like one of those things. And now I'm friendly with those firms. But it's -- you know, these are the most powerful firms in the world.

And they just signed whatever I put in front of 'em. I've never seen anything like it. I'm-- I'm actually surprised myself in a certain way. But they obviously felt they probably did something wrong. I guess that's why they signed.

TERRY MORAN: I guess the question out of that is the concern that people have: Are -- are you using your powers as president to get personal revenge?

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No. I'll tell you what -- I tell you what you sh -- not -- you're really not asking and you should be asking. There has never been a president in this country in the history that was persecuted like I was persecuted by really crooked people. Dishonest, horrible people. And it's been proven.

So when you say I'm treating people rough, I'm not treating people rough. I was treated worse than any president in the history of our country. And, you know, people figured, ""Well, maybe that's it. Finally we got-- you know, he's leaving town. There goes the helicopter.""

And then I came back. And -- I came back because I have tremendous support. You know, when you win an election like I won it -- and you will admit: I won all seven swing states. I won the popular vote. I won -- 700 of -- let's say 2,750 districts compared to 500 districts. That's why the map is all red. And those people feel that I was treated unfairly.

TERRY MORAN: But does that give you the right to go after your political opponents with the powers of this office --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I don't go after -- I don't go -- I'm going after -- all I'm doing -- hey, Biden did something to me --

TERRY MORAN: So --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --a nd I did something to Biden. And you know why I did it? 'Cause he's grossly incompetent. That's not a man that should be allowed to, you know, be lookin' at things that are very confidential.

TERRY MORAN: But what about --71 people you've revoked their --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Here's a man that used an autopen to sign very important documents. Now, who really is -- do -- do you think he knew what -- that they were using an autopen? I mean, he used an autopen to sign very, very important documents. And so those are really the questions you should be asking: ""What do you think of the autopen? Who wielded the autopen?"" Because -- whoever that person was, think of it. Whoever the person that wielded the autopen, he was really the president of the United States.

TERRY MORAN: You are the president, right.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I don't think that Biden knew anything about it --

TERRY MORAN: Okay, fair enough. But you are the president now. And I'm asking the justification for going after people you don't like.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Uh. No, no.

TERRY MORAN: That is the --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: People that I think are dishonest. It's not that I don't -- I don't even know most of 'em. They're people that I think are dis --

TERRY MORAN: These are people that made you angry.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No-- it's not anger. These are people that I think are very dishonest. I don't think they're worthy of being able to go into top-secret information. I think that's fine. And Biden did that with many of our people. But when you look at it -- these are people that I don't think are worthy. That's my decision. It's not a question of anger.

TERRY MORAN: Okay. I understand you just had a phone call with the new Canadian premier. And they just had this election. You were a big issue in it. And Canadians, many of them, are really angry, furious, about your talk about, ""We're gonna take over Canada. It's gonna become the 51st state--""

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: That’s their prerogative.

TERRY MORAN: And it kind of is of a piece -- a lotta -- travel is down into the United States from around the world.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We're doing great --

TERRY MORAN: Feels like there's been reputational damage --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The country's doing great.

TERRY MORAN: Well --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Prices are down.

TERRY MORAN: Not the tourism industry --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Gasoline's down. Energy's down. Tourism is gonna be way up. Wait till you see the numbers. The tourism is way up.

TERRY MORAN: Not now.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Now, Canada -- oh, sure -- tourism's doing very well. We're doing very well. We're doing very well. Wait till you see the real numbers come out in about -- in six months from now wait till you see the numbers.

TERRY MORAN: But do you think --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They're gonna be very good --

TERRY MORAN: I'm gonna ask -- if I may, do you think the reputation of the United States has gone down under your presidency?

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I -- no, I think it's gone way up, and I think we're a respected country again. We were laughed at all over the world. We had -- a president that couldn't walk up a flight of stairs, couldn't walk down a flight of stairs, couldn't walk across a stage without falling. We had a president that was grossly incompetent. You knew it, I knew it, and everybody knew it. But you guys didn't want to write it because you're fake news.

TERRY MORAN: Alright. Thank you --

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And, by the way, ABC is one of the worst. I have to be honest with you --

TERRY MORAN: Okay. Thank you for the opinion. But more importantly, thank you for having us here. I have one more question.

It's a big one. It's a question that you know a lot of people have out there. What do you say to people who are concerned you are taking, seizing too much power and becoming an authoritarian president like we haven't had before?

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, I -- I would hate them to think that. I'm doing one thing: I'm makin' America great again. We have a country that was failing. We have a country that was laughed at all over the world. We had a leader that was grossly incompetent. He should have never been there.

The election was rigged. He shoulda never been there. Our country suffered greatly, and now our country's coming back like nobody can believe. I have editorials just today where they're saying they've never seen anything like it. They love it. Our country's coming back, and we're respected again.

TERRY MORAN: Mr. President, thank you.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Thank you, Terry, very much.

Donald Trump,NA,"Transcript of the 2025 Trump–Zelenskyy meeting - Wikisource, the free online library","This transcript covers the last 10 decisive minutes of the 50 minutes Trump–Zelenskyy meeting on February 28, 2025 (11 a.m.) in the Oval Office. The talking participants were US President Donald Trump, US Vice President JD Vance, and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as well as members of the press.

Vance: “For four years, the United States of America, we had a president (Joe Biden) who stood up at press conferences and talked tough about Vladimir Putin, and then Putin invaded Ukraine and destroyed a significant chunk of the country. The path to peace and the path to prosperity is, maybe, engaging in diplomacy. We tried the pathway of Joe Biden, of thumping our chest and pretending that the president of the United States’ words mattered more than the president of the United States’ actions. What makes America a good country is America engaging in diplomacy. That’s what President Trump is doing.”

Zelenskyy: “Can I ask you?”

Vance: “Sure. Yeah.”

Zelenskyy: “OK. So he (Putin) occupied it, our parts, big parts of Ukraine, parts of east and Crimea. So he occupied it in 2014. So during a lot of years — I’m not speaking about just Biden, but those times was Obama, President (Barack) Obama, then President Trump, then President Biden, now President Trump, and God bless, now, President Trump will stop him — but during 2014, nobody stopped him. He just occupied and took. He killed people. You know what the contact line —""

Trump: “2015?”

Zelenskyy: “2014.”

Trump: “Oh, 2014? I was not here.”

Vance: “That’s exactly right.”

Zelenskyy: “Yes, but during 2014 ‘til 2022, the situation was the same, that people have been dying on the contact line. Nobody stopped him. You know that we had conversations with him, a lot of conversations, my bilateral conversation. And we signed with him, me and you, president, in 2019, I signed with him the deal. I signed with him, (French President Emmanuel) Macron and (former German Chancellor Angela) Merkel. We signed a ceasefire. Ceasefire! All of them told me that he will never go. We signed him a gas contract. But after that, he broke the ceasefire, he killed our people, and he didn’t exchange prisoners. We signed the exchange of prisoners! But he didn’t do it. What kind of diplomacy, JD, you are speaking about? What do you mean?”

Vance: “I’m talking about the kind of diplomacy that’s going to end the destruction of your country. Mr. President, with respect, I think it’s disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office to try to litigate this in front of the American media. Right now, you guys are going around and forcing conscripts to the front lines because you have manpower problems. You should be thanking the president for trying to bring an end to this conflict.”

Zelenskyy: “Have you ever been to Ukraine that you say what problems we have?”

Vance: “I have been to–”

Zelenskyy: “Come once.”

Vance: “I’ve actually watched and seen the stories, and I know that what happens is you bring people, you bring them on a propaganda tour, Mr. President. Do you disagree that you’ve had problems, bringing people into your military?”

Zelenskyy: “We have problems–”

Vance: “And do you think that is respectful to come to the Oval Office of the United States of America and attack the administration that is trying to prevent the destruction of your country?”

Zelenskyy: “A lot of questions. Let’s start from the beginning.”

Vance: “Sure.”

Zelenskyy: “First of all, during the war, everybody has problems, even you. But you have nice ocean and don’t feel now. But you will feel it in the future. God bless–”

Trump: “You don’t know that. You don’t know that.”

Zelenskyy: “...god bless, you are not in a war.”

Trump: “Don’t tell us what we’re going to feel. We’re trying to solve a problem. Don’t tell us what we’re going to feel–”

Zelenskyy: “I’m not telling you. I am answering on these questions.”

Trump: “...because you’re in no position to dictate that.”

Vance: “That’s exactly what you’re doing.”

Trump (angry): “You are in no position to dictate what we’re going to feel! We’re going to feel very good.”

Zelenskyy: “You will feel influenced.”

Trump: “We are going to feel very good and very strong.”

Zelenskyy: “I am telling you. You will feel influenced.”

Trump: “You’re, right now, not in a very good position. You’ve allowed yourself to be in a very bad position –”

Zelenskyy: “From the very beginning of the war—”

Trump: “You’re not in a good position. You don’t have the cards right now. With us, you start having cards.”

Zelenskyy: “I’m not playing cards. I’m very serious, Mr. President. I’m very serious.”

Trump (loudly): “You’re playing cards. You’re gambling with the lives of millions of people. You’re gambling with World War III!”

Zelenskyy: “What are you speaking about?”

Trump: “You’re gambling with World War III! And what you’re doing is very disrespectful to the country, this country that’s backed you far more than a lot of people said they should have.”

Zelenskyy: “I am very in respect with your country!”

Vance: “Have you said thank you once?”

Zelenskyy: “A lot of times! Even today.”

Vance: “No, in this entire meeting, you said thank you? You went to Pennsylvania and campaigned for the opposition in October.”

Zelenskyy: “No. What are you speaking about?”

Vance: “Offer some words of appreciation for the United States of America and the president who’s trying to save your country.”

Zelenskyy: “Please. You think that if you will speak very loudly about the war, you can –”

Trump: “He’s not speaking loudly. He’s not speaking loudly. Your country is in big trouble.”

Zelenskyy: “Can I answer?”

Trump: “No, no. You’ve done a lot of talking. Your country is in big trouble.”

Zelenskyy: “I know. I know.”

Trump: “You’re not winning. You’re not winning this. You have a damn good chance of coming out OK because of us.”

Zelenskyy: “Mr. President, we are staying in our country, staying strong. From the very beginning of the war, we’ve been alone. And we are thankful. I said thanks in this cabinet.”

Trump (loudly talking over Zelenskyy): “You haven’t been alone. We gave you through a stupid president 350 billion dollars. We gave you military equipment. You may have been brave but they used our military equipment.”

Zelenskyy: “What about are we speaking? You invited me to speak –”

Trump: “If you didn’t have our military equipment, this war would have been over in two weeks.”

Zelenskyy (sarcastic): “In three days. I heard it from Putin. In three days.”

Trump: “Maybe less.”

Zelenskyy (sarcastic): “Of course, yes.”

Trump: “It’s going to be a very hard thing to do business like this, I tell you.

Vance: “Just say thank you.”

Zelenskyy: “I said a lot of times! Thank you, to American people.”

Vance: “Accept that there are disagreements, and let’s go litigate those disagreements rather than trying to fight it out in the American media when you’re wrong. We know that you’re wrong.”

Trump: “But you see, I think it’s good for the American people to see what’s going on. I think it’s very important. That’s why I kept this going so long. You have to be thankful.”

Zelenskyy: “I am thankful.”

Trump (talking over Zelenskyy): “You don’t have the cards! You’re buried there. People are dying. You’re running low on soldiers. It would be a damn good thing, and then you tell us, ‘I don’t want a ceasefire. I don’t want a ceasefire, I want to go, and I want this.’ Look, if you can get a ceasefire right now, I tell you, you take it so the bullets stop flying and your men stop getting killed.”

Zelenskyy: “Of course we want to stop the war.”

Trump: “Are you saying you don’t want a ceasefire? I want a ceasefire. Because you’ll get a ceasefire faster than an agreement.”

Zelenskyy: “But I said to you, with guarantees. Ask our people about a ceasefire, what they think.”

Trump: “That wasn’t with me. That was with a guy named Biden, who is not a smart person.”

Zelenskyy: “This is your president. It was your president.”

Trump: “Excuse me. That was with Obama, who gave you sheets, and I gave you Javelins. I gave you the Javelins to take out all those tanks. Obama gave you sheets. In fact, the statement is ‘Obama gave sheets, and Trump gave Javelins’. You’ve got to be more thankful, because let me tell you, you don’t have the cards. With us, you have the cards, but without us, you don’t have any cards.”

Reporter: “One more question to Mr Vice President, I’m sorry –”

Trump: “It’s going to be a tough deal to make. Because the attitudes have to change.”

Reporter: “What if Russia breaks ceasefire? What if Russia breaks peace talks? What do you do then? I understand that it’s a heated conversation right now –”

Trump: “What are you saying?”

Vance: “She is asking what if Russia breaks the ceasefire.”

Trump: “What, if anything? What if a bomb drops on your head right now? Okay, what if they broke it? I don’t know! They broke it with Biden, because Biden – they didn’t respect him. They didn’t respect Obama. They respect me! Let me tell you, Putin went through a hell of a lot with me. He went through a phony witch hunt (referring to the Russiagate scandal), where they used him and Russia. ‘Russia, Russia, Russia!’ You ever heared of that deal? That was a phony Hunter Biden, Joe Biden scam! Hillary Clinton, shifty Adam Schiff. It was a Democrat scam! And he had to go through that, and he did go through it. We didn’t end up in a war. And he went through it. He was accused of all that stuff, he had nothing to do with it. It came out of Hunter Biden’s bathroom, it came out of Hunter Biden’s bedroom. It was disgusting! And then they said ‘Oh, the laptop from hell was made by Russia’, the 51 agents. The whole thing was a scam and he had to put up with that. He was being accused of all that stuff. All I can say is this: He might have broken deals with Obama and Bush, and he might have broken them with Biden. He did, maybe. Maybe he did. I don’t know what happened. But he didn’t break them with me. He wants to make a deal. I don’t know if you can make a deal. The problem is, I’ve empowered you (turning toward Zelenskyy) to be a tough guy, and I don’t think you’d be a tough guy without the United States. And your people are very brave. But you’re either going to make a deal or we’re out. And if we’re out, you’ll fight it out. I don’t think it’s going to be pretty, but you’ll fight it out. But you don’t have the cards. But once we sign that deal, you’re in a much better position. But you’re not acting at all thankful. And that’s not a nice thing. I’ll be honest, that’s not a nice thing. All right, I think we’ve seen enough. What do you think? This is going to be great television, I will say that. We will see what we can do about putting it together. Thank you.”",https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Transcript_of_the_2025_Trump–Zelenskyy_meeting

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

JONATHAN KARL, ABC “THIS WEEK” ANCHOR: Allegations of conspiracy and cover-up. Some of President Trump's most outspoken supporters are now turning on his attorney general.

MAGA backlash over the Jeffrey Epstein investigation.

THIS WEEK starts right now.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Are you still talking about Jeffrey Epstein? Are people still talking about this guy? This creep?

KARL: The Justice Department's Epstein memo this week sparks a MAGA eruption. Could a top administration official now be on the way out? What about the attorney general?

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Who would you guys prefer, Bongino or Bondi?

KARL: Pierre Thomas has the latest from the Justice Department. And Chris Christie and Sarah Isgur on the political fallout.

Pressure campaign.

HOWARD LUTNICK, COMMERCE SECRETARY: The president is driving his agenda. This is his agenda.

KARL: President Trump announces new tariffs on America’s allies and renews his attacks on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Is he about to be fired? Top White House Economic Adviser Kevin Hassett joins me live.

And, changing his tune.

TRUMP: And I'm not happy with Putin. I can tell you that much right now. Because he's killing a lot of people.

KARL: The president loses his patience with Vladimir Putin and resumes military aid to Ukraine. Martha Raddatz and Susan Glasser on the changing dynamics and what it means for the war in Ukraine.

And sources say FEMA failed to answer thousands of calls from flood victims in Texas. That and more with the roundtable.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

ANNOUNCER: From ABC News, it's THIS WEEK. Here now, Jonathan Karl.

KARL: Good morning. Welcome to THIS WEEK.

We begin with the controversy roiling the leadership of the Justice Department. It's an uproar that has pitted the leaders of the DOJ and the FBI, and possibly the president himself, against some of the most prominent voices in the MAGA movement. Just this weekend some of Trump's allies were in open revolt, demanding the resignation of Attorney General Pam Bondi, and accusing her of taking part in a cover-up.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

MEGYN KELLY, AMERICAN JOURNALIST: I don't think he realizes how much she's humiliated the administration. This is a self-inflicted wound. She caused it. Again, I have nothing against Pam Bondi. But if you want to look for the villain in this story, we have found her.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

KARL: This is about the administration's handling of the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein. He was the financier and convicted sex trafficker who was found dead in his jail cell after an apparent suicide in August of 2019. For years, many Trump allies, including his now FBI director, Kash Patel, pushed for the release of the government files on the Epstein case, suggesting they would implicate prominent Americans in a sinister plot.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

KASH PATEL, FBI DIRECTOR (December 2023): What the hell are the House Republicans doing? They have the majority. You can't get the list? Put on your big boy pants and let us know who the pedophiles are.

DAN BONGINO, FBI DEPUTY DIRECTOR (2019): The questions surrounding this alleged suicide are numerous and are worth entertaining and worth getting to the bottom of, quickly.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

KARL: That was Dan Bongino, the former MAGA social media star who is now the deputy director of the FBI. He hasn't been seen at FBI headquarters in days. And some of his allies say he may resign after he had a heated argument at the White House with the attorney general and White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles over how the administration has handled the case, sources familiar with the matter tell ABC News.

It was Bondi who raised expectations earlier this year that the full DOJ and FBI files on Epstein would be released.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

JOHN ROBERTS, ABC NEWS ANCHOR: The DOJ may be releasing the list of Jeffrey Epstein’s clients? Will that really happen?

PAM BONDI, ATTORNEY GENERAL: It's sitting on my desk right now to review. That's been a directive by President Trump.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

KARL: Days later, a group of far-right social media figures walked out of the West Wing of the White House with binders labelled “Epstein Investigation Files” that Bondi said contained, quote, “a lot of information.” But it turned out there was no new information in those files, no client list. They were full of previously released and heavily redacted records.

Bondi then sent a letter to the FBI demanding the full and complete Epstein files be sent to her office and suggested prosecutors in New York were withholding thousands of pages of documents.

In May, Bondi claimed the FBI was reviewing tens of thousands of videos of Epstein, further raising expectations about what would be released.

And now, the big reversal. First, FBI Director Kash Patel poured cold water on the Epstein conspiracy theory in an interview last month.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

KASH PATEL, FBI DIRECTOR (June 6, 2025): We've reviewed all the information and the American public is going to get as much as we can release. He killed himself. Do you think -- let's play out the logical conclusion of this. Do you think that myself, Bongino and others would participate in hiding information about Epstein’s grotesque activities?

(END VIDEO CLIP)

KARL: And last week, an undated and unsigned memo, the Justice Department and FBI announced the end of its investigation, writing that a review found, quote, “no incriminating client list,” and, quote, “no credible evidence” that Epstein blackmailed anyone, and confirming that, yes, he died by suicide.

As for what Bondi said about the, quote, “Epstein client list,” here's what she's saying now.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

PAM BONDI, ATTORNEY GENERAL: I was asked a question about the client list, and my response was, it's sitting on my desk to be reviewed, meaning the file, along with the JFK, MLK files as well. That's what I meant by that.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

KARL: The memo, and Bondi’s comments, didn't put out the right-wing fury over the Epstein case, but it seemed to make it burn brighter, leading to calls for Bondi’s resignation and ominous warnings about the future of Trump's movement.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (July 10, 2025): We need an attorney general who isn't going to lie, who isn't going to be addicted to going on Fox News, and who isn't going to jeopardize mid-term elections and cause President Trump to hemorrhage support from the base.

STEVE BANNON (July 11, 2025): The Epstein situation shows us one central thing, who runs the country. Either the people run the country, right, or the deep state runs the country.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

KARL: And where is the president in all of this? Trump, like many other New York celebrities, had some association with Epstein. You've probably seen this video of Trump with Epstein back in 1992. Decades later, when Epstein was arrested in 2019, Trump said that he and Epstein previously had a falling out and had not spoken in 15 years. And he suggested last year that he believed Epstein did probably kill himself.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TUCKER CARLSON, AMERICAN JOURNALIST (August 2023): Do you think it's possible that Epstein was killed?

TRUMP: Oh, sure. Possible. I mean I don’t really believe -- I think he probably committed suicide.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

KARL: Trump came to Bondi’s defense overnight, posting on social media that she “is doing a fantastic job.” He also urged his followers to, quote, “not waste time and energy on Jeffrey Epstein,” claiming, without evidence, that Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, among others, created the Epstein files. And he directed the FBI to investigate other matters, including the 2020 election results.

So, where does this all leave the Justice Department? We're joined now by ABC's chief justice correspondent Pierre Thomas.

All right, Pierre, you’ve got some remarkable reporting on this confrontation that Bondi had with Bongino in the presence of the chief of staff at the White House on Wednesday.

PIERRE THOMAS, ABC NEWS CHIEF JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Well, Jon, let me be clear, there's always a natural tension between the Justice Department prosecutors and the FBI investigators. Let's get that out in the open.

But this confrontation was unusual in its intensity, I’m told, in terms of Bondi allegedly accusing Bongino of leaking negative information about her. He denied it. And, again, it was very intense in the reporting that we have.

KARL: And he stormed out of the meeting, Bongino.

THOMAS: That's -- that’s some of the reporting we have, absolutely.

And here’s why it matters. These are two of the principal people who oversee the nation's national security in terms of terrorism, counter espionage still. The relationship and how they get along does actually matter.

KARL: It doesn't really work if the deputy FBI director, who runs the FBI day to say, is not basically not on speaking terms with the attorney general.

Let me -- let me ask you, though. There's been a lot of resources dedicated to this. I mean Bondi’s ordered this investigation. What -- give me a sense of how much they've actually spent on Epstein.

THOMAS: Well, at one point we had literally hundreds of agents who were tasked with getting together these files --

KARL: Wait a minute, wait a minute, hundreds of FBI agents?

THOMAS: Yes, that's the information that we have, that they were told, get this information to a point where some decisions could be made about what to release and not to release.

KARL: And now the answer is, they looked into it and they basically didn't find anything?

THOMAS: Well, at the end of the day, what the memo that they put out last weekend said is that he committed suicide and that there are limitations on what they're willing to release to the public and that's where it stands.

KARL: OK. I want to ask you before -- while I've got you. There was another remarkable story late this week, and that is that the FBI has been doing polygraph tests on its own workforce and that among the questions that are being asked is, have you said anything negative about FBI Director Kash Patel.

THOMAS: Well, let me be clear, there are always leak investigations and polygraphs and that sort of thing. It's been expanded from what our reporting is. And we do know that there's real concern about the so-called “deep state”.

And they've been asking questions trying to get at whether any of these people had political motivations in terms of the prosecution of former -- of, you know, then-candidate Donald Trump and now President Donald Trump.

And so, they're digging around again to make sure in their mind they want to be comfortable that they're not people still within the government --

KARL: I mean, that is pretty extraordinary though to see -- to being asked, “Have you said anything negative about the director?”

THOMAS: Well, some of the questions we’re told have to do with associations and political -- you know, for example, Pete Strzok, some of the people who --

KARL: Yeah.

THOMAS: -- are known to have said negative things. They want to know, “Have you been associated with those kind of people?”

So, it gets back to the issue of loyalty and whether they're fair or not to President Trump.

KARL: All right. Pierre Thomas, thank you very much.

I am joined now by former New Jersey governor and former U.S. Attorney, Chris Christie, and SCOTUSBLOG editor Sarah Isgur, who served as a spokesperson for the Department of Justice in the first Trump administration.

All right, Chris. Thank you for being here.

Let me get right to the president's very lengthy statement overnight defending Pam Bondi because it starts by saying, ""What's going on with my boys and in some cases gals?"" They're all going after Attorney General Pam Bondi, who's doing a fantastic job. We're on team MAGA. I don't like what's happening.”

So, are those boys and gals of team MAGA going to go along with this?

CHRIS CHRISTIE (R), FORMER NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR & ABC NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, look, what Donald Trump is learning is when you start the fire, sometimes you can't put it out. Now, he started this Epstein fire during the campaign and prior to that by alleging that this was all some, you know, Democratic plot, that he was perhaps murdered by former Democratic officeholders, that there were a lot of Democrats who had been down to Jeffrey Epstein's island and all the rest.

He used that to fire his own base, and he was going to get to the bottom of it, and he was going to release it because he's in -- absolutely in favor of transparency. Well, now you get into the job and you realize -- you know, maybe I don't want to do that.

And let's be clear about this: Pam Bondi -- there's no chance, in my opinion, that Pam Bondi made this decision on her own. No chance. She was instructed by the White House that we're not releasing this stuff. And that's why he's defending her.

And now he's at cross purposes though because when you bring in people like Kash Patel and Dan Bongino who are true believers in what Trump was saying prior to getting elected, they're saying, ""Wait a second. We came here to do the transparency thing.""

KARL: It seems to me that it wasn't so much Trump himself that was fueling the conspiracy theories. It was the people very close to him, his biggest supporters, people like Kash Patel and like Dan Bongino.

CHRISTIE: But, Jon, wait a second. We cannot let the president off that easily.

He benefited directly from it. He fueled it. He encouraged it. And he certainly didn't stop it.

So, you know, part of what bothers me in this context is that Donald Trump gets a pass. Oh, it wasn't him. It was somebody else. He took these people who were doing exactly what you just said and put them in charge of the people on the front line of protecting the American people from crime and terrorism and counterintelligence operations.

He encouraged this and by putting them in those positions, he supported the work they were doing.

KARL: Well, let me play what Trump said Tuesday at his cabinet meeting. When he's there at the cabinet meeting, Pam Bondi is just a couple seats away from him and a reporter tries to ask Bondi about all of this, and Trump intervenes and says this.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: Are you still talking about Jeffrey Epstein? This guy's been talked about for years. You're asking -- we have Texas, we have this, we have all of the things, and are people still talking about this guy, this creep? That is unbelievable.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

KARL: Okay. So, Sarah, he said it's unbelievable and people shouldn't be talking about this. That was Tuesday.

Yet all week his people have been talking about it, people like Steve Bannon, Megyn Kelly, Charlie Kirk. These are -- these are prominent figures in his movement who have been talking relentlessly about this.

SARAH ISGUR, EDITOR AT SCOTUSBLOG & ABC NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: We've heard plenty of times with folks trying to determine whether this is where the MAGA base abandons Trump and things like that. And I think those have all been pretty -- pretty big misunderstandings of how that hard candy coating around Donald Trump works.

You know, for instance, we saw that conversation happen around the pro-life movement that Donald Trump was abandoning pro-life principles and that maybe this would break up the MAGA movement.

But that hard candy coating, the people who really go out there day-to-day to defend whatever Donald Trump says, they're not policy people. They're not pro-life. They actually aren't even that big on immigration.

They're really big on this stuff, though -- JFK, Epstein, the moon landing, chemtrails.

So, this actually does have a real potential to influence whether Donald Trump has that protection between him and his base, that -- those translators. And that's what you're seeing this week is, those translators are taking a really long time to come back to Donald Trump, longer than I think we've seen to date.

KARL: I mean, I'll tell you this, if you look at his Truth Social post, again, this very long Truth Social post, the responses -- and who knows, they could be trolls, whatever, but are almost universally negative. People saying that they're not buying it. They're not ready to move on.

When --

ISGUR: Well, Jon, you had Santa's elves telling kids that Santa doesn't exist, and they're having a really hard time with that.

KARL: So, let me -- let me then play a little bit more from Kash Patel. We heard in the open. This was Kash Patel. He went on Joe Rogan's podcast in June and was asked about all of this, and here’s what he had to say.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

KASH PATEL, FBI DIRECTOR (June 6, 2025): The problem is there's been, like, 15 years of people coming in and creating fictions about this that doesn't exist. Where is the videotape of an Epstein island, x, y and z committing these frauds? Why haven’t you given it to us? Do you really think I wouldn't give that to you if it existed? I'm working my (EXPLETIVE DELETED) off, along with the leadership at the bureau and DOJ, to give you what we're allowed to give you.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

KARL: So, again, let me ask the fundamental question, are -- is the base going to buy it? You have the president saying nothing to see here. You have Kash Patel, who had been fanning this stuff directly saying, look, I mean, I would tell you. I got nothing.

CHRISTIE: Well, look, I'll tell you, I'll answer his question.

KARL: Yes.

CHRISTIE: Yes, I don't believe you give it if the president of the United States ordered you not to, because you haven't shown any independence from the president of the United States in your entire career. So, while he's asking me to believe something, like, would -- could you possibly believe me, Kash Patel, wouldn't do it, even if the president of the United States told me not to?

Look, the president made it very clear in the video we just saw before Patel's, I'm done with this. I don't want to talk about it anymore.

Donald Trump never gives, or very rarely gives, direct orders. What he does is, he does something like that, which is sending the signal out to everybody else, enough, stop. And so, I'll answer Kash Patel's question. Yes, I don't believe you would give it to us if, in fact, the president of the United States told you not to and your direct boss, the attorney general of the United States, has ordered you not to. And that's where we are.

KARL: So, Sarah, let me ask you really what is the big question. They have released -- they released, like, 11 hours of videotape of -- of Epstein's cell. It seems pretty well established that he, in fact, killed himself. I guess there are 60 seconds that are missing that has been attributed to a glitch. Well -- so, the big question is, is this now case closed on all of those conspiracy theories?

ISGUR: This was always strange to me because it depends what you mean by conspiracy theories. In terms of whether Epstein killed himself or this list that there's just no evidence ever existed, yes, I mean I hope those hundreds of FBI agents can go now, do some national security work, real stuff.

KARL: Yes.

CHRISTIE: Right. Right.

KARL: Yes.

ISGUR: However, like, where did Epstein's money come from? Where did the money now go? I mean, I guess I do still have questions about that. I'm surprised that, again, these people who made a lot of money and careers and got their current jobs based on this conspiracy theory aren't telling us any of those answers that they could have found. At the same time, hiding behind, you know, saying, well, we're not going to release, for instance, videos of minors or grand jury material that’s sealed by the court. Like, OK, but this was your bread and butter, literally.

CHRISTIE: And you know what we're finding out, Jon? Running the government is a hell of a lot tougher than running a podcast.

KARL: That’s -- that’s actually (INAUDIBLE) --

CHRISTIE: Running the government is a hell of a lot tougher than writing a children's book.

KARL: And I guess the big question now, is Dan Bongino going to leave and resign and go back to his podcast, or is he going to stay deputy director?

CHRISTIE: He doesn’t like his job anyway. Come on.

KARL: Anyway -- well, Sarah, Chris, thank you very much.

Up next, the president announced new tariffs on America’s biggest trading partners, and he turned up the heat on the Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Could he be on his way out? We'll ask the White House Economic Adviser Kevin Hassett.

We're back in two minutes.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: I think he's done a terrible job. I think we should be --

UNKNOWN: You're going to fire him?

TRUMP: No. I think we should be three points lower interest rate. He's costing our country a lot of money. We should be number one and we're not, and that's because of Jerome Powell.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

KARL: That was President Trump this week criticizing the head of the Federal Reserve. Trump Economic Adviser Kevin Hassett joins me from the White House North Lawn.

Thank you very much, Kevin, for being here. Let me -- let me ask -- we'll get to Powell in a second, but let me ask you about the new tariffs that the president has just announced that he's going to impose on August 1st on Canada, European Union, and Mexico. Why now? What's going on?

KEVIN HASSETT, WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL DIRECTOR: Well, I think that we've got a deadline that's coming up in early August, and the thing about President Trump, if you go back and look at his history, that he became one of the most successful, if not the most successful, businessman in the 20th century because he was able to squeeze everything out of every deal that he made, and right now we've got that guy who wrote ""The Art of the Deal"" making deals for the American people, and we've got to see where the dust settles.

The bottom line is that he's seen some sketches of deals that had been negotiated with Howard Lutnick and the rest of the trade team, and the president thinks that the deals need to be better, and to basically put a line in the sand, he sent these letters out to folks. And we'll see how it works out.

KARL: I mean, for all the talk of deals, I mean, there were talks of 90 deals in 90 days and then the president actually said 200 deals at one point. And we've really only seen really two and a half deals. We've seen the U.K., we've seen Vietnam, and kind of a framework on China.

HASSETT: Right.

KARL: So let me ask you, because what we're hearing from the Europeans and from the Mexicans is they were in the middle of these negotiations as this was, as this was going on, so is this a negotiating tactic, or are these tariffs real?

HASSETT: These -- well, these tariffs are real if the president doesn't get a deal that he thinks is good enough, but, you know, conversations are ongoing, and we'll see where the dust settles. The bottom line is that President Trump has produced a huge amount of tariff revenue with the tariffs we've seen in the first half of the year. The Congressional Budget Office has said that tariff revenue over the next 10 years will help reduce the deficit and secure our entitlement programs is $3 trillion and consumers haven't seen that.

You know, Consumer Price Index inflation right now is the lowest it's been in over a decade. And so what President Trump has always said is that the foreign suppliers, the foreign governments are going to bear most of the tariffs. It's being visibly seen, and I think that that's probably affecting his negotiating position because we've got all this empirical evidence that his position has been proven correct in the data.

KARL: Well, as you know, a lot of economists say that the inflation will be coming and that there was -- there were certainly a lot of exports that were, I mean, imports that were brought in in the anticipation that tariffs would be placed.

But let me, let me ask you about one new set of tariffs that he announced on Brazil. Fifty percent new tariff on Brazil. Brazil had a $6.8 billion surplus last year. In fact, the U.S. hasn't had a trade deficit with Brazil since 2007. I mean, almost two decades. So why, why, why are we putting a punishing 50 percent tariff on Brazil?

HASSETT: Well, bottom line is the president has been very frustrated with negotiations with Brazil and also with the actions of Brazil. In the end, though, you know, we're trying to put America first. I think that a lot of people, when I'm talking to negotiators from other country is at some point they'll say, ""What did we do wrong?""

And what I'm trying to get -- the message we're all trying to get across is this is about America getting itself ready for the golden age by getting our house in order, by getting our tariff and trade policy and tax policy exactly where it needs to be for a golden age.

And normally, it's not necessarily about a specific country, but with Brazil, it is. Their actions have shocked the president at times, and he's made -- been clear about that.

KARL: But I don't -- I don't understand how you're saying it's about America because the president has made it quite clear that what he's upset about is how the Brazilian Supreme Court has handled the criminal case involving former President Bolsonaro. I mean --

HASSETT: I'm agreeing with you. What I'm saying is that what I've been saying with most countries was that it's really about us getting the tariffs in order. And I think that this tariff for Brazil is a lot higher because of the president's frustration with Bolsonaro.

KARL: But --

HASSETT: And the fact that Bolsonaro himself -- you know, anyway --

(CROSSTALK)

KARL: But can you explain to me, because I find it confusing here, what -- on what authority does the president have to impose tariffs on a country because he doesn't like what that country's judicial system is handling a specific case?

HASSETT: Well --

KARL: I mean, how -- how is that --

HASSETT: If he thinks it's a national defense emergency or if he thinks it’s a national security threat, that he has the authority under IEEPA.

KARL: So, how is it a national security threat that, you know, how Brazil is handling a criminal case against this former president?

HASSETT: Well, that's not the only thing. That's not the only thing. I mean --

KARL: So, what is it? I mean, I've asked what it is. I mean, it seems that that's what President Trump's talking about. He's talking about his anger and his frustration. He's been quite candid about it with the Bolsonaro case.

HASSETT: Right. Well, the bottom line is that what we're doing absolutely collectively across every country is we're onshoring production in the U.S. to reduce the national emergency that is -- that we have a massive trade deficit, that's putting it at risk should we need production in the U.S. because of a national security crisis. And this is part of an overall strategy to do that.

KARL: But again, as we've just established, we have a trade surplus with Brazil, not a deficit.

HASSETT: But --

KARL: And we've had a surplus with Brazil for 18 years.

HASSETT: If you look at an overall strategy, if you don't have an overall strategy for this, then there'll be trans shipping and everything else, and you won't achieve your objectives.

KARL: Okay. I'm still confused, but let me move on.

Let me ask you about the 50 percent tariff that the president has imposed on copper imports. Copper, of course, is widely used in construction, industrial manufacturing, cars, mobile phones, and the like.

This is what “The Wall Street Journal” had to say about these tariffs: “Mr. Trump is going to make U.S. firms pay 50 percent more for a vital metal while they wait five or more years for U.S. sourcing. How does making it more expensive to build aircraft, ships, and ammunition promote national security? This is national insecurity.”

What's your response to “The Wall Street Journal”?

HASSETT: Right. The bottom line is that if there is a time of war, then we need to have the metals that we need to produce American weapons, and copper is a key component in many American weapon sets. And so, as we look forward to the threats that America faces, the president decided that we have plenty of copper in the U.S., but not enough copper production. And that's why he's taken this strong step.

KARL: But are you concerned about the effect of higher copper prices before American manufacturing can get up to speed?

HASSETT: The fact is that that effect that you're just discussing is something that you mentioned that economists said were going to be coming all year, these effects, and inflation is way, way down. In fact, inflation in the U.S. is right about the same level as it is in Europe.

KARL: Okay.

HASSETT: And so, the tariffs have worked the way that we said. And so, I guess the expectation would be that the countries and the people that are dumping into the U.S. would bear most of this tariff.

KARL: Before you go, I want to ask you about Jerome Powell, the Fed chair. The administration's been highly critical of the way the Fed has handled renovations to its -- to its building, to its headquarters here in Washington.

Two-point-five-billion-dollar renovation sounds like a lot to me, I have to admit.

HASSETT: Yeah.

KARL: But let me ask you, could this be used as a predicate to fire the Fed chair?

HASSETT: I think that whether the president decides to push down that road or not is going to depend a lot on the answers that we get to the questions that Russ Vought sent to the Fed. The bottom line is that this is the most expensive project in D.C. history, $2.5 billion with a $700 billion cost overrun.

To put that in perspective, the cost overrun for this Federal Reserve project is about the same size as the second biggest building overhaul in American history, which was the FBI building. And so, the Fed has a lot to answer for.

And the bottom line is -- the bottom line is that there's a key statutory problem. In 1913, when we founded the Fed, the U.S. was under a gold standard.

So, it was never envisioned, never envisioned by the people that voted for the construction of the Fed that we currently see, that the Fed could print money and toss it around willy-nilly because they had to have the gold to do what they're doing. And they're unbounded right now.

KARL: Literally -- right, literally print the money to do the renovation.

Very quickly, yes or no answer, does the president, in your view, have the authority to fire the Fed chair?

HASSETT: That's a thing that's being looked into. But certainly, if there's cause, he does.

KARL: Okay. Thank you very much, Kevin Hassett.

HASSETT: Thanks, Jon.

KARL: Really appreciate it.

Up next, did President Trump just break up with Vladimir Putin? Martha Raddatz reports when we come back.

Up next, did President Trump just break up with Vladimir Putin? Martha Raddatz reports when we come back.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

KARL: Remarkable change in President Trump's public stance on Vladimir Putin this week. Trump saying the Russian leader is, ""Not treating human beings right. He's killing too many people."" My co-anchor, Martha Raddatz takes a look at Trump's shift and what it could mean for the battle in Ukraine.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

MARTHA RADDATZ, ABC NEWS CHIEF GLOBAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This week, with Russia's assault on Ukraine far from over, a stark and surprising shift in President Trump's tone towards Vladimir Putin, a man he has often praised.

TRUMP: We get a lot of (expletive) thrown at us by Putin, if you want to know the truth. He's very nice all the time, but it turns out to be meaningless.

RADDATZ (voice-over): Trump lashing out at the Russian president and promising new weapon shipments to Ukraine.

TRUMP: We are going to send some more weapons. We have to; they have to be able to defend themselves. They're getting hit very hard now.

RADDATZ (voice-over): A stunning reversal after the administration put weapons shipments to Ukraine on hold last week without explanation.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Did you approve of that policy?

TRUMP: We wanted to put defensive weapons because Putin is not -- he's not treating human beings right. He's killing too many people. So, we're sending some defensive weapons to Ukraine and I've approved that.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So who ordered the pause last week?

TRUMP: I don't know. Why don't you tell me?

RADDATZ (voice-over): Putin's reaction was swift, launching Russia's largest attack on Ukraine since the war began more than three years ago. More than 700 drones and a dozen missiles launched in the massive aerial assault, much of it aimed at Kyiv. Trump reportedly saying he struck a deal with NATO leaders to supply weapons to Ukraine and teasing a big announcement for Monday.

TRUMP: You'll be seeing things happen.

RADDATZ (voice-over): Trump also considering granting Ukraine's request for an additional Patriot air defense system.

TRUMP: When you talk about a system like that, highly sophisticated, tremendous amount of money, and they're doing it because they want to prevent death.

VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT: Hi, everybody.

RADDATZ (voice-over): Ukraine's President Zelenskyy telling me last month that without U.S. military support, including those Patriot missile batteries, there will be more Ukrainian losses.

RADDATZ: If you do not get more U.S. aid, more U.S. military aid in particular, can Russia win?

ZELENSKYY: More -- more chance. More quick. But you know what we will have? We will have more losses. Much more losses. Without help of the United States, they can give us -- they can provide us, for example, missiles for a better (INAUDIBLE).

RADDATZ (voice over): And President Trump now signaling he's ready to support bipartisan legislation, imposing more sanctions on countries that trade with Russia, as lawmakers push to get the bill passed.

SEN. JOHN THUNE, MAJORITY LEADER: It's leverage that we need and that, frankly, the White House needs in their negotiations are the Russians.

RADDATZ (voice over): But in an interview in Moscow in May, Putin's spokesperson telling me that more sanctions targeting Russia will not bring them to the negotiating table.

DMITRY PESKOV, KREMLIN PRESS SECRETARY: It's very hard to threaten Russia with sanctions. We are a country that is experiencing a luxury of maximum sanctions that, in the history of the world, was applied. And we're a country that used to live and to live quite well under those sanctions.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

KARL: Our thanks to Martha.

I'm joined now by “New Yorker” staff writer Susan Glasser.

Susan, you just wrote a piece in ""The New Yorker"" with the headline ""Did Trump Really Just Break Up With Putin?"" So, what's the answer?

SUSAN GLASSER, NEW YORKER STAFF WRITER: Well, the answer is, maybe. Bottom line, Donald Trump, as you know, over the last ten years, has largely been incredibly complimentary of Putin. But what he's recognized is that in more than 100 days he hasn't fulfilled his pledge to end the war in Ukraine in 24 hours. And, at a minimum, Trump has been personally embarrassed, you could argue, by how Putin has strung him along and strong him along and strung him along. So, you know, it was a striking shift in tone. What we're waiting for with this big announcement, quote/unquote, tomorrow is to see whether he follows through with a change in actual policy.

KARL: But what do you think’s coming tomorrow?

GLASSER: Well, you know, it’s interesting because Donald Trump, again, has talked tougher on Russia, but right now the big question is, would the Trump administration, would this particular Republican Congress actually send more weapons to Ukraine? And the bottom line is that the last authorization of weapons was under Joe Biden's presidency in the final days, $1.25 billion. That is going to expire later this summer.

And, right now, there is no indication at all that this White House or this Congress is prepared to have a new bill authorizing billions more in aid. And, in the end, if Ukraine does not keep getting a steady supply of aid from the United States in the west, it doesn't really matter if Donald Trump curses at Vladimir Putin.

KARL: It would have to have serious Democratic support. Although it’s interesting, both speakers Johnson and John Thune have historically been supporters of aid to Ukraine.

But -- but let me -- let me ask you this, because you know Russia so well. You were based in Russia. You -- you -- you lived in Moscow as a -- as a correspondent. Are you seeing any indications that Putin is concerned about Trump's new tone? Or, what's the reaction coming from the Russians?

GLASSER: Well, I think it's striking that again and again and again over the last few months Putin has responded to Donald Trump by escalating the war. He has had an aerial bombardment of Ukraine and its civilian population in cities that has gotten tougher and tougher, frankly. The more that Putin was offered by Donald Trump, actually a very good deal, Donald Trump, according to reporting, gave him the chance to essentially keep the territory that he has illegally gained through this war of aggression, and Putin is saying, no, I want to go for it. I want to go bigger.

And that indicates that Russia thinks that its military position is actually strengthening in this conflict. That Ukraine is struggling on a variety of fronts, including the idea that Donald Trump and the West is not really there for the long haul.

KARL: If Congress passes these sanctions, which are -- seem to me pretty tough, that -- because they're not just -- they’re not on Russia, they're on people that trade with Russia, right? If - if -- if they pass these sanctions, Trump signs them and imposes them, will it make a difference? I mean Russia has been so heavily sanctioned.

GLASSER: Yes, that’s -- I think it's a, first of all, a big, important question. Second of all, it doesn't require Trump to impose these --

KARL: It gives him the power to do that.

GLASSER: Exactly. So, it really is a positioning, a messaging thing. Trump already has enormous power to impose additional sanctions on Russia, which he has chosen he not to do so. And I think that's the significant point, is it words right now or is it going to be followed up with actions?

KARL: All right, Susan Glasser, thank you very much.

Coming up, after devastating floods hit the Texas hill country, the Trump administration seems to have shifted its stances on eliminating FEMA. We'll discuss that and more with our roundtable.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

KRISTI NOEM, HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY: FEMA has been deployed and we're cutting through the paperwork of the old FEMA, streamlining it much like your vision of how FEMA should operate.

TRUMP: We have some good people running FEMA. It's about time, right, we get some good ones. They failed us in North Carolina, but when we got in on January 20th, they fixed it up in no time.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

KARL: DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and President Trump this week touting improvements to FEMA under their watch, after previously saying they plan to disband the agency.

The roundtable is here. We'll get back in just a few minutes.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

KARL: All right. Let's bring in the roundtable.

Former DNC chair, Donna Brazile, former RNC chair and Trump White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus, Center for American Progress president and CEO, Neera Tanden, and “National Review” editor, Ramesh Ponnuru.

Thank you all for being here. Before we get to all the other stuff, just a follow-up on all the Epstein news.

Reince, we heard from Steve Bannon late yesterday saying that, that this whole controversy could cause 10 percent of MAGA to stay home and not vote in the midterms, and that could cost 40 seats for the Republicans in the House. Is this -- could this potentially hurt the president?

REINCE PRIEBUS, FORMER RNC CHAIR, FORMER TRUMP WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF & ABC NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: If the election were held tomorrow, perhaps, but certainly not in 2026. Look, there are issues here that need to be resolved. Number one, from a White House perspective, chief of staff perspective, you have a staff issue, right? I mean, you've got a deputy director taking on AG publicly; that has to get resolved very quickly.

KARL: I mean, he walked out of a meeting at the White House, stormed out with the chief of staff.

PRIEBUS: So how do you resolve these things? You come up with a solution, and you -- and I would predict that you're going to see probably this week, something laid out as far as how we're going to deal with this issue, whether it's going to be a -- is there going to be a commission? Is there going to be a press conference? Is there going to be something moving forward?

KARL: But I thought the president said no more on this. We've talked about it too much.

PRIEBUS: Well, I think this is going to be -- this is going to have to get resolved both on the staff side and the solution side. And I would suspect that you're going to see something very soon.

KARL: Donna?

PRIEBUS: It's not sustainable.

KARL: Donna?

DONNA BRAZILE, FORMER DNC CHAIR & ABC NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, first of all, conspiracy theories, by nature, they're dangerous.

KARL: Yeah.

BRAZILE: It undermines trust. And it's very difficult to put the genie back in whatever bottle once it's out. This has been a comical relief, not the case itself, but the way in which they've handled it from the DOJ perspective to the White House, storming out of the meeting, all of the public threats, and now a big conference where this is the central theme, not that big beautiful betrayal. The central theme is why is this file being trashed? We need more information. It's all about the conspiracy.

RAMESH PONNURU, NATIONAL REVIEW EDITOR & ABC NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: President Trump loves conspiracy theories. President Trump has indulged one after another after another. You could argue that (inaudible).

(CROSSTALK)

PRIEBUS: QAnon -- President QAnon.

PONNURU: The birther conspiracy about President Obama was one of the ways he originally won the Republican nomination and, just as a tactic, saying you could look at all of these other conspiracies, but don't look at this one right here.

KARL: Yeah.

PONNURU: That is a very bad tactic for putting this to bed.

NEERA TANDEN, CENTER FOR AMERICAN PROGRESS PRESIDENT & CEO: Also, I mean, the Attorney General Pam Bondi went to the public and said all kinds of things about this. She said there was a list, there was files, they had people. That was in front of the White House, in front of the West Wing, that they had the influencers out there. So, I mean, there's a very legitimate question here.

Number one, was she lying then? Or is she lying now? She's the Attorney General. I do think she should go in front of Congress and sort of just explain the facts here, because ultimately, it is a big question. Was she just prancing around making things up? You're not really supposed to do that as the Attorney General. And then second of all, I'll just say, the -- everyone's acting like they don't know what the conspiracy theory is.

The conspiracy theory is that the client list has Donald Trump on it, and that's why his government is holding it back. And I think he should just -- we need to have people honestly answer questions in front of Congress or the press to just have this out once and for all.

PRIEBUS: And the overall problem with this case and why it's hard to just move on, that it's just a conspiracy. Listen, there are victims here and there are perpetrators who haven't been charged.

BRAZILE: Yeah.

PRIEBUS: And the public looks at that and says, OK, I get it. You guys are fighting over the one minute and this and that, but overall, we have a very bad thing that happened and there are people that got away with it, and that doesn't sit well with the public.

KARL: So let -- let me ask you about -- I mean, let me show you what Elon Musk, I don't know if you've been watching his X feed during all of this.

(LAUGH)

KARL: Elon Musk has been on this Epstein thing over and over again. Here's what he said. One of his many tweets. How can people be expected to have faith in Trump if he won't release the Epstein files? So my question is not that, Ramesh. My question is about Elon Musk and a third party, because Elon Musk has been saying time for a new party. He's going to theoretically fund one. How real is this threat?

PONNURU: Well, he certainly has the money to put behind any political initiative that he wants to undertake. But, we have historically not had a lot of success with third parties. The reasons we haven't had much success with third parties are still in place. And you also have to wonder whether he's the right guy to be behind it. He's an unpopular man and the platform he apparent -- presumably wants to promote, it not particularly popular either. You know, sure, a lot of people are very concerned about the Epstein issue. A lot of people are very concerned about entitlement spending. The intersection of those two groups, I don't know if that's a large constituency.

(LAUGH)

KARL: But Donna, you've seen, I think, in your past experience in politics that a third party --

BRAZILE: Third party.

KARL: -- doesn't need to be very big to have an impact.

BRAZILE: Look, I believe everyone should have a choice. They should have an opportunity to vote, you know, however they please, but the fact that Elon Musk, his brand is as tarnished. Well, I should say it this way. He's as popular as a root canal. How can he build a political party with a tarnished brand?

KARL: But -- but, Reince, Trump is really upset about this. I mean, he's been, you know, that the feud with Elon is what it is, but it seems particularly this idea that he would start a third party.

PRIEBUS: Well, because, granted, third parties -- I mean, the stacks -- the deck is stacked against them, right?

KARL: Right.

PRIEBUS: I mean, ballot X, winner-take-all electoral college, state legislatures, OK, but if someone is willing to spend a couple hundred million dollars, maybe more because Musk's ego is at it, you know, Jill Stein, Ross Perot, Ralph Nader, a few points here and there can make a difference. Forty seats? No. But, can it make the difference between winning and losing the majority in the U.S. House and having the Democrats taking over oversight? Could be.

BRAZILE: Yes.

TANDEN: Yes, I -- I would agree with that. I don't think the danger of the third party is him winning and becoming president, the danger of the third party is that he would split Republican votes. I mean, this is the person --

KARL: And, and he's born in South Africa so he's not going to be president so --

TANDEN: He is not going to be president of the United States.

PRIEBUS: Right.

TANDEN: But he spent hundreds of millions of dollars to help elect Donald Trump.

KARL: He's actually born in Africa.

(LAUGHTER)

KARL: We know that.

PRIEBUS: (INAUDIBLE).

TANDEN: So, so, but I mean, that's the dangers that it's -- look, I agree with you. It's like it splits up a lot of people. Maybe puts the Senate in play.

PONNURU: Republican voters who are dissatisfied with the Republican Party hate the Democratic Party more that they're dissatisfied with the Republican Party. They're not going to defect. If they were going to defect in that kind of magnitude, that would have happened in the 2016 election.

PRIEBUS: Understood but if --

TANDEN: But maybe it gives them an option. Maybe it gives them an option to go somewhere else.

PRIEBUS: If you put $5 million in a congressional seat that's in play and somebody, you know, someone people know, a local bank, a local car dealer, it can -- it can make a difference.

PONNURU: The congressional seats that are in play are going to have plenty of money spent on both sides.

KARL: Let me --

PONNURU: It's not going to be decided.

PRIEBUS: I think you're mostly right, but I'm just saying in the small spaces it can hurt.

KARL: It can hurt. It can hurt in there.

TANDEN: It can hurt.

PRIEBUS: That's right.

KARL: So, so -- but let me ask, can we switch topics to -- the horrific scene in Texas? And we saw at the top of this that now they're talking about improving FEMA and not eliminating FEMA, it's a bit of a change in tone. But I want to play something when Trump went to Texas and he was asked a question about the warnings, could there have been better warnings. Take a listen.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

UNKNOWN: The several families we heard from are obviously upset because they say that those warnings, those alerts did go out -- out in time and they also say that people could have been saved. What do you say to those families?

TRUMP: Well, I think everyone did an incredible job under the circumstances. Only a bad person would ask a question like that, to be honest with you. I don't know who you are but only a very evil person would ask a question like that. I think this has been heroism. This has been incredible.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

KARL: So it was evil to ask about families who were upset about lack of warnings. Also, Donna, we've had this report in ""The New York Times"" that FEMA didn't answer thousands of calls from flood survivors, essentially because a contract had been taken down by Department of Health -- Homeland Security.

BRAZILE: We need a strong FEMA. If -- if there's one thing in life I know a lot about --

KARL: Katrina.

BRAZILE: It's the aftermath. I mean, first of all, they didn't get the proper warning.

KARL: Yes.

BRAZILE: That's -- that's problem number one. But after an event, you need federal resources on the ground. States cannot handle this by themselves. With Katrina, we had over 5,000 FEMA employees. We had the National Guard. We had the U.S. military. And the fact that many of those resources are not available to the states, I mean, you just make the problem even worse.

I have to say something. Look, I understand the president wants to praise everybody when he gets up to speak, when you weaken FEMA --

KARL: Heck of a job.

BRAZILE: I mean, heck of a job, Brownie. You weaken FEMA. But with over 2,000 employees cut, 16 senior executives who know how to handle this kind of strategy, catastrophic losses, it's terrible that FEMA is not there to respond and to help the people in need.

KARL: And the acting FEMA director just got on the ground.

TANDEN: Yes, I mean, I think there are several errors here. One, as you said, they've been weakening FEMA all along. Two, they weren't pre-positioning people. People knew about this, Chip Roy knew that it was an issue we came back. But FEMA wasn't pre-positioned. And then, third, it's just, just to say this, they cut the contracts as this was happening. So call centers were down. And, you know, with all due respect to the president, last year, in North Carolina, he went on a vicious attack when there was no evidence FEMA didn't do everything it could do, almost zero evidence. Here, he's basically like everything is fantastic when there are still people hurting and these aren't like --

BRAZILE: And missing.

TANDEN: -- Republicans or Democrats. It's a --

BRAZILE: People are still missing.

TANDEN: People are still missing. Exactly.

PRIEBUS: There's plenty of time. As Donna said, there's plenty of time for us to go through this and find all the nexuses between what wasn't done right and what could be done better.

KARL: But I'm talking about the future and FEMA because they had talked about eliminating FEMA.

TANDEN: Yes.

(CROSSTALK)

KARL: Kristi Noem has said, and the state should be empowered to do this stuff on their own.

PRIEBUS: But, one doesn't beget the other. I mean, perhaps there is a better way to structure FEMA. It doesn't mean -- there can't be just one way for us to deliver emergency relief to people that are suffering. And so, I don't think it's off limits to analyze it. But in the meantime, we've got a lot of families that are grieving and arguing over whether phone calls were received or not.

And yes, we should -- maybe there should be a warning system. There's I think a lot in play here, but I don't think now is the time to start analyzing why and what -- that it's someone's person that's being blamed in FEMA.

(CROSSTALK)

KARL: A phone call.

TANDEN: Why is -- why is --

(CROSSTALK)

PONNURU: What is happening in New Mexico.

TANDEN: It's the families --

PONNURU: It's happened in Oklahoma.

PRIEBUS: No.

TANDEN: No, no, no, no. I'm sorry.

PRIEBUS: You guys are politicizing this, and I think it is ridiculous.

(CROSSTALK)

PONNURU: (Inaudible).

TANDEN: I'm sorry. This is an issue that's live right now. Families can't get through in the call centers. Like they weren't able to get through.

KARL: Two-thirds of the calls.

TANDEN: That is happening in real time right now. So, I think using the excuse that it's too close means that we'll just won't do enough --

PRIEBUS: No, no, no.

TANDEN: -- to help the families right now.

PRIEBUS: There are state resources. There's governors. There are federal resources. There is a lot of people here that are helping. There are people down there by the thousands delivering relief.

KARL: I mean, there are people --

(CROSSTALK)

PRIEBUS: And there are people who are grieving.

KARL: Ramesh?

(CROSSTALK)

PRIEBUS: And there are people who are grieving.

KARL: Look --

PONNURU: To the extent that there are knee-jerk criticisms that assume the conclusions, right, that haven't gone through and looked at all the evidence, that deserves being called out. But the president is trying to shut down the whole conversation.

TANDEN: Exactly.

PONNURU: He's saying let's not even ask the questions. It's evil to ask these questions. And I heard that question being asked during that press conference, and it was not a got you question. It was not a question trying to go after the president. It was a completely reasonable question that we have to be able to ask.

PRIEBUS: At the right time. Not where families are waiting for their children.

(CROSSTALK)

PONNURU: A press conference is the right time.

(CROSSTALK)

TANDEN: I'm sorry, why was it -- was it the right time during North Carolina for the president to (inaudible) everything?

PRIEBUS: People are looking for their dead children. I'm not talking about North Carolina.

KARL: All right, we've got to take a break. Well, thank you very much. We'll be right back.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

KARL: That's all for us today. Thank you for sharing part of your Sunday with us. Be sure to watch the ""Wimbledon Men's Final"" today on ESPN. Have a great day.

In Lengthy Press Conference, Trump Weighs In On Special Counsel Probe, January 6 Pardons, Ukraine and Gaza, Renaming Gulf of Mexico. Aired 12:30-1p ET

Aired January 07, 2025 - 12:30   ET

THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES:  -- and 5 cents on the dollar. [12:30:03]And you know, what they were doing? They were calling us up and saying, we'll sell it back to you at 200 cents. In other words, double what we paid for it. So they were going to buy it from this guy for 5 cents on the dollar. They were making deals. And fortunately, we had a very smart judge that stopped it cold. I think he called for an investigation too, and he should. But think of it, they were selling the wall. That was exactly the wall that the Border Patrol wanted, that was designed by them -- steel, concrete, rebar, exactly as they want. Very, very heavy steel, very powerful steel, hard to cut, very, very heavy 7,000 pound concrete, which is a very strong concrete. Everything was top of the line, very expensive. Would be double what we paid for it then six years ago. But let me just tell you, they were selling it for 5 cents on the dollar to people. And those people were calling us, asking us to pay them 200 cents because it's a good deal, because we can have it immediately. And you know what immediately is? Just leave it in place. No, no, the -- the papers have been written that though. You know, that deal is like all the other things that these people are doing, these people either hate our country or they're very stupid. And I don't believe they're stupid because nobody can cheat on elections like they cheat and be stupid. They either hate our country or they're stupid. So remember what I said because nobody wants to report it. They were selling the wall for 5 cents on the dollar and trying to resell it back to us for 200 cents or less, but for 200 cents on the dollar. That's a -- that's a nice return. (CROSSTALK)REPORTER:  -- announced it will be stopping fact checks on posts on its website and --  TRUMP:  Say it? Say it?REPORTER:  Meta said today it would stop putting fact checks on its website and instead allow community -- TRUMP:  Well, I watched their news conference and I thought it was a very good news conference. I think they've -- honestly I think they've come a long way -- Meta, Facebook. I think they've come a long way. I watched it, the man was very impressive. I watched it, actually, I watched it on Fox. I'm not allowed to say that. Say it? REPORTER:  Do you think he's directly responding to the threats that you have made to him in the past with these actions? TRUMP:  Yeah, probably. (CROSSTALK)REPORTER:  The last time you were -- the last time you were here, you were asked a question about the U.S. possibly launching a preemptive strike on Iran. You said you wouldn't answer that question. TRUMP:  On who?REPORTER:  Obviously -- on Iran, the U.S. launch a preemptive strike on Iran's nuclear facilities. TRUMP:  And I said, I don't -- I don't talk about it. It's a military strategy.REPORTER:  But it is a legitimate question. It's something --  REPORTER:  Well, it's not really because only a stupid person would answer it. TRUMP:  Look, it's a military strategy, and I'm not answering your questions on military strategy. All right, one more. Brian, go ahead. Brian?REPORTER:  Would you -- could you give us a preview of what you might be talking to leaders of Congress who expected to come here in the next couple of days, and you've got a very supportive Congress behind you?TRUMP:  Yeah, they're great. So we have a wonderful Republican Congress. We have a leader that have a lot of confidence in. I think he's going to be hopefully a great leader, a great speaker. And we have a leader, by the way, in the Senate, I think has been great. John Thune has been doing a fantastic job.But it goes through the House first. And the question is whether or not we do the two bills, the one bill. And, you know, look, I can live either way. I like the idea of the one big bill, but I can live either way. But they'll be coming down. The senators also will be coming down. And then ultimately we'll be meeting in the White House in a few weeks. But right now, this is the winter season. You know, they sort of call this the winter White House. It was built. I don't know if you know this, Marjorie Merriweather Post and E.F. Hutton built this. It was the greatest of all the estates in our country. And I saved it. And I got a lot of credit for saving it. Most of these big, great houses have been knocked down in Palm Beach. Just about all of them, actually. And they, you know, you build ten mansions on one site, but we saved it. But this was built as the southern White House, and she gave it to the government. And by the way, Jimmy Carter gave it back. He said it's too expensive for the United States. So I didn't -- I didn't realize that.REPORTER:  I was just -- I was just told --  TRUMP:  Actually, Jimmy Carter -- Nixon was through Watergate. He came down. He -- Nixon came here once and he thought it was incredible. But he had a thing called Watergate if anybody remembers that. And so he had other things on his mind, to put it mildly. And Jimmy Carter felt that it was too extravagant for the country. So fortunately for me, he gave it back to the foundation, and I bought it from the foundation. (CROSSTALK)REPORTER:  On reconciliation, some Republicans saying in trade for a massive bill that you and they share the interest in, they want to see big spending cuts. Do you agree with that? And what -- TRUMP:  Well, I'm okay with spending cuts. I like spending cuts. Just -- I'm on the record for spending cuts. And the debt ceiling was given to us. It shouldn't have been, but it was put in our lap. And what I want in terms of debt ceiling isn't the ceiling. [12:35:03]I just don't want to see a default. That's all I want. I never talked about spending more money necessarily, than all I want to see is no default, because nobody knows what would happen if there was a default. It could be 1929 and it could be nothing. But that was put into default, because nobody knows what would happen default, because nobody knows what would happen if there was a default. It could be 1929 and it could be nothing. But that was put into our lap and it shouldn't have been, but it was. And so we'll handle it. But debt ceiling is not about raising a lot of money. It's really just about extending it. I just want to see an extension. (CROSSTALK)REPORTER:  Mr. President, on immigration, sir, on immigration.How much can you do by executive order? Are you planning to do on executive order when it comes to immigration? And how much do you want Congress to tackle this issue? And also on day one --  (CROSSTALK)TRUMP:  Well, I had the safest border in the history of our country by far. You remember the famous chart that I brought down. I love that chart very much for a lot of reasons, but I have the safest border by far in the history of our country, and when I took it over, it was a mess. Nothing like it is now. This is ten times worse. When I got elected because of the border the first time, and I think I got elected largely because of the border the third time, and the second time I did equally well. Well, not as well as the last time, but I did very well. And I will say this was too big to rig, you know, you know the expression? Too big to rig. They couldn't do it. They tried, but they couldn't do it. I didn't get very much from Congress at all. I just said that we're being invaded, and I took the money out of the military. Much of the wall I built 500 -- over 500 miles of wall. Much of that wall was built through money that had put into the military. We took it out because we couldn't get things from Congress in those days, and we took it out, and that wall was built largely with money coming from the military. So, very simple. I went to the military -- I said, our country is being invaded by very similar. Nothing like what's invading our country now. They weren't releasing prisoners into our country and they weren't releasing mental institutions in. But some -- some bad dudes were coming in, right? And I said, our country is being invaded. And I took that money largely from the military. I was sued nine times by the Democrats in Congress, and I won all those suits and we built five -- we ended up building 571 miles of wall. Once that wall was built, they start going around it. So we're going to add another 200 that would have been up in three weeks. And then we had a very unfortunate election result. And they said we don't want to put it up. We'll sell it. And they started selling it for 5 cents on the dollar. What a -- what a --  (CROSSTALK)TRUMP:  So we'll do this again. I just want to thank everybody very much. I'm just telling you, this will be the golden age of America. This is the golden age of America. We're going to have a great country again. We're a country right now under siege. We have so many different problems and nobody respects us overseas. But now they do. The Italian prime minister, as you know, came here the other night, just flew in and flew out. She wanted to -- she wanted to see me and great respect is being shown. When I went to the cathedral in France, great respect was shown by the prime minister, the president, by everybody. France was -- and by the way, I have to say they did a great job in the cathedral. But great respect is being shown to our country again, and we have a great country, but we have to run it properly. It's going to be run properly. We want to get back those hostages for Israel and for us. You know, we do have people that are hostages being held. And I'll just say it again, if this deal is not done with the people representing our nation, by the time I get to office, all hell is going to break out. Thank you very much. Thank you. (CROSSTALK)REPORTER:  -- Ukraine, Russia, war before you take office?REPORTER:  Can you clarify what you mean by military? DANA BASH, CNN HOST:  Welcome to INSIDE POLITICS. That was over an hour of Donald Trump giving a news conference, answering questions and giving us some new information about what he intends to do, or at the very least, is not ruling out when he takes office, including not ruling out a military invasion to conquer Greenland, the Panama Canal and perhaps the annexation of the country of Canada. There is a lot more to discuss. We have a terrific panel here. Kaitlan Collins, you are our chief White House correspondent, in addition to all of your other titles. (LAUGHTER)BASH:  What's that? KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Thirteen more days to go. BASH:  Yeah. Okay, okay. But you obviously have been covering Donald Trump for a very long time. Before I get to you, I do want to play David Sanger, our friend at ""The New York Times"". His question about the Panama Canal and on Greenland and Donald Trump's response before you respond. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  No, I can't assure you on either of those two. But I can say this: we need them for economic security. [12:40:05]The Panama Canal was built for our military. REPORTER:  (INAUDIBLE)TRUMP:  I'm not going to commit to that now. It might -- it might be that you'll have to do something. Look, the Panama Canal is vital to our country. It's being operated by China. China. And we gave the Panama Canal to Panama. We didn't give it to China. And they've abused it. They've abused that gift. It should have never been made, by the way, it was -- giving the Panama Canal is why Jimmy Carter lost the election, in my opinion, more so maybe than the hostages. The hostages were a big deal. (END VIDEO CLIP)BASH:  Okay. So the question is, Kaitlan, how much of this is Donald Trump being trying to negotiate and posturing and warning them? And how much do you really think he means it, particularly given the fact that a big part of his consistent campaign message for eight years has been, I'm going to get us out of wars. COLLINS:  Well, I mean, it was an extraordinary moment, one of the most extraordinary moments of that press conference where he was refusing to rule out using military force to retake the Panama Canal, something that he himself brought up. I should note in this press conference, when a reporter later asked, why are you bringing this up? Obviously, it's a signature achievement of Jimmy Carter. He's about to be lying in state here in Washington, Trump said he was asked about it, but Trump brought it up in his opening remarks. It's something that he's been quite fixated on behind the scenes, from what I've heard from -- from sources in the past few weeks on this issue, complaining about Chinese influence. Obviously, this was a signature achievement of Jimmy Carter's. He believed it improved relations with Latin America for the United States, and still, it's one of his biggest accomplishments that people talk about. But Trump there saying that he would not rule out using military force to retake it, is not something that should be treated as with bluster. I mean, Trump is coming into this White House and is intentionally staffing his administration with aides who will not block what he wants to do or what he ultimately seeks. There were many instances in his first term where he wanted to do something, but advisers either convinced him not to or Republican lawmakers did. That is not going to be the same Washington that we are encountering in 13 days from now when Trump takes office. So I would treat everything he said there quite seriously. I mean, moments after he said he wanted to rename the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America, Marjorie Taylor Greene is saying that she's going to advocate for that. But I do want to say one of the biggest things that stood out to me from that press conference, from moments when Trump got out there before he even started taking questions, is the level of anger. BASH:  He's really agitated. COLLINS:  Well, we know why. He made it quite clear a few moments, and its two things. It's his legal issues overall, but it's -- it's the sentencing that he is facing on Friday that so far is still Judge Merchan has denied efforts to delay it. His attorneys are still working to do so. And two, it's this report by Jack Smith that we are told is imminent and is going to come out. Trump was informed during that that Judge Cannon down in Florida has tried to temporarily block that. Well, it's not a settled matter. We'll see if it's successful. But his level of anger over that is unmistakable. He has not been this angry since he won the election. BASH:  And, John, I wanted to intentionally start a little bit micro on Panama and on -- and on Greenland, particularly since his son is in Greenland as we speak. But I do want to sort of open it up a little and talk big picture about your takeaway from, as Kaitlan just said.JOHN KING, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  It is remarkable. Somebody who is two weeks from resuming the presidency of the United States, who whether you voted for him or not, whether you like him or not, just engineered a remarkable historical political comeback, is so whiny and so full of grievances. Now, that is Donald Trump's trademark. That has been his trademark since he came down that escalator. He uses grievance to keep his people together, to keep his base together, and to keep his team loyal. But he came out clearly -- his lawyers had access to the Jack Smith report at a private meeting here in Washington, D.C. They have briefed him on it. He is going to now try to use every legal power he can to prevent its release. You could see how angry he was about it. There's the sentencing on Friday. He was beating up on Joe Biden, who, yes, is using his powers on the way out to sign executive orders to do things that Donald Trump fundamentally disagrees with. COLLINS:  Trump also did. KING:  Welcome to it -- as Trump also did. Welcome to American politics. But talking about how he's inheriting a mess, he's inheriting the strongest economy in the world. It has troubles. It has potholes, it has issues. But he's inheriting the strongest economy in the world. And the Biden team is working with him as Donald Trump's own negotiator acknowledged on the very difficult issues about in the Middle East, about hostage releasing and about trying to finally bring about a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. His negotiator was very polite and respectful of the Biden administration. Trump was quite scornful and not factual. DAVID CHALIAN, CNN WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF:  Can I just say I thought that was like a bookend to the interview Susie Wiles did, who was also very respectful when she talked to ""Axios"" about Jeff Zients, the current White House chief of staff. So you have Steve Witkoff on one end talking about working so well with the Biden team in tandem on an issue as fraught as trying to get these hostages out. You had Susie Wiles on the front end two days ago yesterday saying that the chief of staff, the current Biden chief of staff, is doing everything very kind. [12:45:03]And yet in the middle of all that, you have Donald Trump trying to gin up this notion to your point about grievance, saying that they're throwing everything at this to make this a very difficult transition. KING:  Everybody's still out to get him. He just won an election. And then he questioned the election again, too. It was too big to rig, he said. He won the election. He won the popular vote. He should be celebrating. He should be coming into Washington. Yes. He has very narrow majorities in the House and the Senate. It's going to be difficult to get things done, but this should be someone who is upbeat and happy to come in. But he is still full of grievances because it is his organizing principle. But there are a lot of lies in there. That was a trailer -- that was an hour long trailer for the next four years, in that he tells a lot of lies. He hedges, he exaggerates and hypes a lot of things, but he also made a ton of news there. You're right. You're right about the idea that it's posturing, but the idea that he couldn't rule out econ -- using either economic leverage or military force to take Greenland and the Panama Canal, he says he's going to rename the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America. Canada, our closest friend in the world, our neighbor to the north, a giant economic partner, is in the middle of a political crisis right now. And he just poured kerosene on the fire. BASH:  That's why he did it. CHALIAN:  Military action there. (CROSSTALK)BASH:  Well, he did.CHALIAN:  He did actually -- KING:  He said he would, but he said he would use economic leverage. BASH:  He did. He said, I will use economic force because Canada and -- well, actually, let's listen to what --  KING:  Your neighbor's house is on fire and you don't call the fire department and you pour kerosene on it. BASH:  Let's listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REPORTER:  Are you also considering military force to annex and acquire? TRUMP:  No economic force, because Canada and the United States, that would really be something. You get rid of that artificially drawn line, and you take a look at what that looks like. And it would also be much better for national security. Why are we supporting a country $200 billion plus a year? Our military is at their disposal. All of these other things, they should be a state. That's why I told Trudeau when he came down, I said, what would happen if we didn't do it? He said Canada would dissolve. (END VIDEO CLIP)BASH:  Now, if anybody has moved since Trump was elected to Canada, they're going to be looking down from the north to the south saying, okay, is this going to happen? But no, but in all seriousness, John, you said that he's pouring gasoline on a fire. Excuse me, while Canada is having trouble. But the reality is that part of why Canada is having trouble, why Trudeau resigned yesterday is because of these threats. It's also because there's anti-incumbent fever globally and has been all year. The fact that they are in such turmoil, he believes -- Trump believes that he has maximum leverage right now with Canada.CHALIAN:  Precisely. Yeah. And you hear this -- he keeps talking about this $200 billion trade deficit, which he sees as a giveaway to Canada. And there's no doubt he sees this. In fact, he was asked about the election, if he might be able to work better. And he said, well, that guy, the conservative, may not even win. Or, you know, he didn't want to get in there because he did want to use this moment for maximum leverage. I will say just two other things that I think it's worth noting in the press conference. One, he continued, just because were a day after January 6th, to say that pardons are coming, as he has said --  BASH:  And he said, I'm making major parties.CHALIAN:  Making major pardons as it relates to January 6th, though not a clear blanket pardon for everyone involved. But clearly that is still on very much front of mind for him. And I do think you -- you heard in the press conference him at times he was asked about prices and his comments to ""Time Magazine"" about sort of expectations, setting that getting prices down is tough. He understands, you see there that he won this election on the economy and on immigration. He -- he said that as much. And so it was interesting to hear him reassert what he said at the time, which is like, oh, prices are going to come down, but it is tough to get prices down. He -- he wants to have that both ways. BASH:  I don't want to lose sight. We're going to -- Daniel Dale is getting ready to do a fact check on what he said about January 6th. And, who was killed and what the sort of what actually happened that day. But before we get to that, before this press conference and what we heard about Panama and the Panama Canal and Greenland and Canada and a whole host of other things, by far the biggest news story was Mark Zuckerberg saying this morning that they are totally changing their rules. They're getting rid of third party fact checkers, effectively saying exactly what -- what X is doing, what Elon Musk is doing and what Donald Trump and MAGA world have been asking for, for a very long time.Our Steve Contorno asked whether or not he believes that these changes, capitulations are a direct response to Trump's threat, and Trump just said one word: probably. COLLINS:  Well, I mean, the value to listening to Trump and to airing these press conferences is that he often says what he really thinks.[12:50:02]And he just had dinner with Mark Zuckerberg -- BASH:  Exactly. COLLINS:  -- at Mar-a-Lago not that long ago, not far from where he was standing. And that is how the Trump team views this big announcement. There's a reason it was announced on Fox News today. Trump was watching it as it came out and had an idea that this was coming. And so, certainly, I mean, we're seeing a lot of big tech companies and big tech founders making the trip down to Mar-a-Lago. Now, Facebook and Meta are part of that. And so we're seeing all of that part of this. That is also what I'm saying about how we should be taking what Trump is saying seriously, in the sense of he is coming into an area where big tech and big business are trying to appease him and listening to him, and certainly trying to make sure that Elon Musk isn't the only person who has major contracts that he's able to secure with the federal government. But what he's saying about Greenland there and saying not ruling out military force to David Sanger is notable. But then he said that he believes the U.S. needs Greenland for national security reasons. This has been something he has been thinking for eight years. It was brought up by ""The Wall Street Journal"" when they first reported it during his first term. But he also threatened economic coercion against Denmark, saying that he could level tariffs against them if they do not refuse to -- to provide it or sell it to the United States. That is certainly going to be an avenue. I mean, Trump's national security aides, secretary of state, incoming, potentially, Marco Rubio, the national security advisor, Michael Waltz, those are all comments that Trump is going to be committing to and keeping up with when he takes office. BASH:  Go ahead.KING:  And one other quick one we haven't mentioned because there was so much there is there's going to be a lot of reverberations throughout NATO and Ukraine. BASH:  Yeah, that was the other thing I was just going to point out -- KING:  Because he took Vladimir Putin's side about Ukraine and NATO, saying, I understand why Russia would be mad that some country on its doorstep would join NATO. And he said he was frustrated. He thought it was inappropriate that he talked to Putin before he's actually inaugurated. BASH:  Can we just stop right there, John?KING:  Yeah.BASH: Just that quote alone. KING:  Yeah, Russia is mad. And I understand that.BASH:  That Russia invaded a democracy --  KING:  A democratic nation within Europe. BASH:  -- and he understands why Russia. KING:  He understands why Russia -- well, he understands why Russia is mad. Let's be careful and let's be fair to President Trump. BASH:  That's fair. KING:  President-elect Trump. He says Russia is mad that NATO -- would be considered for NATO membership because it's on his doorstep. Ukraine is a democracy within Europe, and there's a process to apply to NATO. There has been for quite some time.The fact that the president of the United States, the leading superpower in the NATO alliance, would say, I understand that. BASH:  And he also said --  CHALIAN:  He also suggested there was some deal. He thought that was in place, that Ukraine would not -- is suggesting that Ukraine would not look for NATO membership, and said his understanding was that it was written in stone for Russia, that Ukraine would not seek entrance into NATO. COLLINS:  They also said Russia wasn't in Ukraine when he was in office. Obviously, they had illegally annexed Crimea when Obama was in office. They were fighting in Ukraine. CHALIAN:  Yes, indeed. KING:  And he said -- you know, again, we have one president at a time, which can be those lines get blurred a lot. But he did say he thought it was unfortunate he couldn't speak to Putin now, but he did say that he would speak with him as soon as possible. He gave --  BASH:  I think the question was meet with him.  KING:  Somebody said, would it take six months? Meet with him, meet with him.Now, Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor, has met with Putin. He was the first one because German. I don't want to get into German politics right now. They're complicated as well. The global politics are complicated. He finally did -- no other western leader since Putin invaded Ukraine, has met with him for the president-elect of the United States said, lets do this. To do this as soon as possible is big international news that's going to cause a lot of reverberations around Europe. BASH:  Okay. Daniel Dale has been waiting patiently. Daniel, we were talking about the president-elect's comments about January 6th. I know that there were a number of statements that are not accurate. Can you tell us what happened? DANIEL DALE, CNN SENIOR REPORTER:  There are. So listen to what he said about one prominent rioter and the presence of guns at the Capitol that day. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP:  Ashli Babbitt was killed. She was shot. She had never been shot. She was shot for no reason whatsoever. In fact, they say that she was trying to hold back the crowd, and the crowd was made up of a lot of different people. So we'll see. But I will tell you this, the person that was -- was killed was Ashli Babbitt. This would be the only insurrection in history where people went in as insurrectionists with not one gun. Okay?And let me tell you, the people that you're talking about have a lot of guns in their home. (END VIDEO CLIP)DALE:  This not one gun thing, Dana, has been debunked for three and a half years now, if not more. It is an out and out lie. Now, we'll never get a complete inventory of the number of guns brought by people to the Capitol that day, because most of them were permitted to leave before later being arrested. But there have been numerous cases in which people carried guns on Capitol grounds and were convicted for it. I have a list in front of me. Mark Mazza, two loaded handguns on Capitol grounds, five years in prison. Guy Reffitt, more than seven years in prison carried a handgun on Capitol grounds. Christopher Alberts had a pistol during the riot. Seven years in prison. Jerod Bargar pleaded guilty, had a pistol there. John Banuelos charged for allegedly twice firing a pistol in the air on Capitol grounds. Roger Preacher, pistol in his waistband. Mario Morris of Texas convicted of having a pistol in his waistband at the Capitol. So, the not one gun thing is out and out false. Now, on the Ashli Babbitt case -- look, it's subjective of whether she should have been shot. I can't fact check that, but the president- elect is certainly leaving out some pertinent facts here, specifically that Ms. Babbitt was a rioter who was trying to enter a shattered window of the House speaker's lobby had been warned not to do so, was carrying a knife. So, certainly, not just wandering around aimlessly or something of that sort. BASH:  All right. Daniel, thank you so much for that. Appreciate it. And staying on the sort of broader topic or the related topic to January 6th, I don't want to lose sight of what he said about Jack Smith, calling him deranged and worse, which is, I know, not new. He called him mean and nasty, but also what happened while this press conference was going on, which is that Judge Aileen Cannon, a judge who actually he said that he had never met, even though he obviously had a very important case before her, and he appointed her to the federal bench. She ruled that this report that Jack Smith put together will remain sealed. COLLINS:  And she's not the final say I should note. We'll wait to see, because obviously the Justice Department is going to respond to this, I would presume basically this report from our understanding, and we learned a lot from a filing that came out last night. Trump's attorneys and the attorneys of his allies/co-defendants in Florida reviewed this over the weekend. They got to go to the DOJ, go into a conference room and actually look at this report. The understanding is, as they laid it out in this filing, is that it's two parts. On the election interference case and the classified documents case. They were arguing, in part, that the classified documents case shouldn't come out because of the Walt Nauta and Carlos de Oliveira. They still have charges pending against them. But Trump's attorneys signed on saying none of this should be able to come out because Jack Smith's not supposed to be special counsel, which is Judge Cannon's findings as well, which is why the classified documents case is no more. Trump found out during that that she says right now, temporarily, this report cannot be released. They can't. The Jack Smith can't even transmit it to the Justice Department, is what she's arguing. We'll see if that holds. Obviously, there will be appeals. We're told it could come out really any day now, potentially by the end of this week. But they are fighting very hard. And he is very angry that even part of this could come out. What I've heard from people over the last few weeks is that a lot of this has to do with the Mueller report coming out and how Trump felt about that, because it went into details about his aides and whatnot. So we'll see if it ultimately comes out. But I mean, he came out and I think so much of what we heard was there was this underlying level of anger about this and the sentencing in New York. BASH:  But I agree with that. I believe, because he talked about the ""injustice department"", quote, unquote, many, many times. The whole beginning of this news conference was also about the series of executive orders that Joe Biden has issued relating to land -- relating to oil and gas. And that kind of prompted a lot of what he said, said yesterday on Truth Social. And again, at this press conference about the fact that he doesn't think Biden is giving him a proper transition, which Susie Wiles his incoming chief of staff, explicitly said the opposite. But I don't -- I don't want to gloss over some of the interesting things that we heard. We heard things before about windmills and so forth. But --  KING:  Don't forget about water in your dishwasher. BASH:  He went off about and we've actually heard a little bit about that before, believe it or not. But he went off about, his anger about gas stoves and gas heat in particular, and the fact that the Biden administration wants to be more electric and that he said, you know, people know that if you have electric heat in your apartment, in your house, you get the itch. CHALIAN:  I mean, he has guys this -- he's talked about these kinds of things, these environmentally tangential pieces of your everyday home life. He gets obsessed with them.BASH:  Yes.CHALIAN:  But as I listen to Kaitlan talk about the anger that was on display here, I do think it is important to note how much that is in contrast to what we've seen since the election in November from him. That is a -- this was a more familiar Trump to anyone who paid attention to the four years where he felt completely under siege all the time when he was in the White House. That's not how he felt. He -- I mean, he's given voice to this when he said, you know, everyone used to attack me, and now everyone's being a friend of mine. That's part of his sort of lighter feeling about this moment and becoming the 47th president again, different than he felt becoming the 45th president. And this was a return -- to your point about the trailer, I just wonder if America knew we were going to get sort of this kind of repeat performance. BASH:  I'm sure --  KING:  It's just a fascinating glimpse of his mindset, the artificial line separating the United States and Canada. I know that's an internationally recognized border, as is the sovereignty of Greenland, as is the treaty where Jimmy Carter signed over the Panama Canal, as is when you pull out a map. I use maps every now and then where it says the Gulf of Mexico. That's been there for a while. Donald Trump thinks if I wanted to be, it shall be. It's just a fascinating glimpse at his mindset. And, you know, in 13 days, he becomes president of United States again. And we will -- we will watch how much again, she knows better than anyone at this table. A lot of what he says is for negotiating purposes and purposes, to get some percentage of what he really says is what he wants. But here it comes. BASH:  They say you should live in interesting times. These are those times. Thank you all for getting us through that. I appreciate it. Thank you for watching INSIDE POLITICS.
