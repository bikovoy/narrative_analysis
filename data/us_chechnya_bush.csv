George W. Bush,"June 06, 2001",Press Briefing by National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice on President's Travel to Europe,"The James S. Brady Briefing Room
5:35 P.M. EDT
DR. RICE: Good evening, everyone. On Monday evening, June 11, the President will depart on a five-day trip to Europe that will take him to Spain, Belgium, Sweden, Poland, and Slovenia. The President will return on Saturday night, June 16th -- I might add, very late on Saturday night, June 16th.
The President's first official trip to Europe will express his vision of a Europe, whole, free and at peace, and it will include the following themes: NATO as an anchor of U.S. engagement; transatlantic security, and a force for stability and security throughout Europe; the U.S.-EU partnership for security and prosperity; the enlargement of the sphere of freedom, security and democracy. And the President also looks forward to his first meeting with President Putin and advancing an agenda for a constructive and realistic relationship with Russia.
I should note that this the first of two trips to Europe this summer. The G7-G8 meetings in Genoa in July will highlight the global dimension of our relationship with Europe. First, to the stop that we will make in Spain. The President will arrive in Spain on Tuesday morning, June 12th. While in Spain, the President will meet with King Carlos I and Queen Sophia. He will hold a bilateral and a lunch with Prime Minister Aznar and he will participate in a press availability at the Aznar ranch.
Spain is an appropriate place for the President to begin his trip. This country is an important NATO ally and trading partner, and a great example of successful post-authoritarian transition, and it is fast emerging as an influential European partner.
U.S. cooperation with Spain extends from the Mediterranean to Latin America. We have troops on the ground together in the Balkans, and we have important U.S. military installations in Spain. The President plans to cover a range of issues while there, including bilateral relations, trade issues, the Balkans, the Middle East, and European security including NATO enlargement.
The President spoke with Prime Minister Aznar early in February, and he, of course, received the King and Queen here in late March, and he looks very much forward to seeing them again in Madrid.
The President departs Spain Wednesday morning, June 13th, and goes on to Belgium. While in Belgium, the President will meet with NATO Secretary General Robertson, and with NATO leaders at NATO Headquarters. There he will have a press availability at NATO Headquarters. He will, afterwards, meet with King Albert II and Queen Paola. He will attend a U.S. Embassy greeting and hold a bilateral meeting with the Belgium Prime Minister.
During that part of the trip, the themes are that NATO embodies the transatlantic link that binds Europe and North America. It is based on common defense and security, as well as shared values and principles. The visit to NATO reaffirms the U.S. commitment to a strong alliance and to meeting new challenges together with our allies.
The President will discuss key NATO issues, adapting the Alliance to meet new challenges, defense capabilities, NATO enlargement, a new strategic framework for nuclear weapons, the European Security Defense Policy, missions in the Balkans, NATO outreach to Ukraine, Russia and --
The President is also looking forward to the bilateral component of the visit there. Belgium is a valued NATO ally and will hold the next EU presidency starting July 1. As I've said, the President will see the King and the Prime Minister there, and he will discuss U.S.-EU trade agenda, the broader U.S.-EU agenda, European security and also begin to preview with our European allies the question of AIDS in Africa, because that will undoubtedly be a major topic at the G-8 in July.
The President departs Belgium Thursday morning, June 1, and arrives -- I'm sorry, June 14th, and arrives on June 14th. While in Sweden, he will hold a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Perrson, attend a U.S.-EU summit and luncheon, participate in a press availability, meet with King Karl Gustaf and Queen Sylvia and have dinner with EU leaders.
The President's first U.S.-EU summit is a chance to advance his vision of a global partnership with the EU. The EU is already our largest economic partner, with an annual, two-way trade and investment profile of well over $1 trillion per year.
We're working well together to bring peace and stability to the Balkans and to integrate emerging democracies into Euro-Atlantic institutions. The summit is an opportunity to provide better definition and impetus to our common agenda with the EU, including the launch of a new trade round, addressing the scourge of contagious diseases like HIV-AIDS, exploring the different approaches to meeting our common goal of addressing climate change, and looking at Southeastern Europe and other regional security challenges.
The President will depart Sweden on Friday morning, June the 15th, and arrive in Poland. While in Poland, the President will hold bilateral meetings with the President and Prime Minister of Poland, lay wreaths at the Tomb of the Unknown, at the Warsaw Ghetto memorial, and at the Warsaw Uprising Memorial. He will deliver a speech at the university library and attend a state dinner, and of course, visit the U.S. Embassy in Poland.
Poland is a great success story of the post-communist era. It has built a stable democracy, a strong economy and a vibrant society. It's one of the three new allies in NATO, and the President will take the opportunity to celebrate that with the Poles while talking about this as just the beginning of a U.S.-Polish relationship that should benefit all of Europe and beyond.
The key security issues that the President will talk about there will be NATO enlargement, and he will talk also about our consultations on the new security framework. You may remember that Poland was one of the stops for the consultative team that went out a few weeks ago.
You should know that the President phoned President Kwasniewski early in his presidency, and he's stayed in close touch. And he appreciates the Polish government's tough economic reforms and will make that point to Prime Minister Buzek.
President departs Poland on Saturday morning and arrives in Slovenia. And while in Slovenia he will hold bilateral meetings with the Slovenian President Kuchan, and with the Prime Minister and, of course, he will meet there with President Putin of Russia.
But I want to make very clear that Ljubljana is not just the site of a meeting with the Russian President; it is in its own right an important stop for us, because the Slovenes have shown what a successful country in transition can achieve. It has been excellent on matters of economic reform. It is moving to an excellent political consolidation of its democracy, and the Slovene leadership seems to be determined to implement the necessary economic legal military reforms to become contributing members of EU and eventually of NATO.
The President looks forward to these meetings, and he also looks forward, of course, to meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin face to face. He will have an opportunity there to discuss with President Putin his vision for security in the 21st century and to explain to President Putin his desire to build a positive and constructive relationship with Russia.
The meeting is planned for a little over two hours between the two Presidents. We have a lot of work to do with the Russians, and the President is eager to begin it with President Putin. In addition to presenting his view on the nature of the relationship and its very important security component -- that is, to talk about the new security framework -- the President really wants to talk more broadly about the U.S.-Russian relationship, areas of cooperation, regional areas in which we are already cooperating, like Nagorno-Karabakh. Economic cooperation, and as well, areas with which we have differences with the Russians on proliferation, on Chechnya, on media freedoms in Russia.
But I want to be very clear that this will be an opportunity for the two men to get to know each other and an opportunity to sketch out a broad vision for the relationship. That is really the purpose of this meeting.
At the conclusion of the meeting with President Putin, the President returns here to Washington.
Q: What's the message the President's going to bring to allies who are critical of the administration's positions on global warming and missile defense?
DR. RICE: Well, first of all, the administration will bring to the allies another statement of our very strong interest in a strong alliance and strong Alliance relations. And as a part of that, we will understand that there will be times when we don't always agree on exactly what approaches to take to different problems. They will, I think, an important discussion of global climate change, a problem that the President takes very seriously, and he's looking forward to hearing from our friends and allies.
On missile defense, I think that I would not characterize it as disagreement. I would say that we're in the midst of ongoing consultations with our allies about how to best move forward to address the common threats of today's security environment. We understand that we're putting a lot on the table in talking about an entirely new security framework, a new comprehensive approach that includes a new offense-defense mix that puts offensive nuclear reductions on the table; that talks about new efforts at nonproliferation. We understand that there is a lot to digest here. The consultations have just begun and we look forward to talking with the Europeans.
But the one thing the President will really underscore is that we have more in common than we have in disagreement, and that we really should be celebrating that which we have in common.
Q: Just to follow up, besides listening to them on global warming, what is the message he's going to bring? ""I'm opposed to Kyoto, but"" --
DR. RICE: The President, as you know, because he was concerned about this issue, but has believed that the Kyoto Protocol did not address the issue properly, the President has had a high-level Cabinet working group that has been working very hard at this problem, but it's ongoing work. It is work that is continuing. A lot of ideas are being explored.
It has been a matter of bringing up to speed some of the highest-ranking people in this government. I would dare say -- dare challenge you to find a situation in which you've had so many high-ranking people sitting there week after week after week, understanding the challenge that we face in global climate change. Everybody from the Vice President, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Interior, Secretary of Agriculture. It has been quite something to see all of these people grappling with the issue.
The President has met with that group and he will have some ideas. But this is ongoing work and he really wants to talk about the seriousness of the problem and how we address it.
Q: Dr. Rice, is that to say, then, that whatever is announced, either prior to or during the course of the talks during the trip, will be more in line with I'm opposed to Kyoto, but these are principles that I adhere to and we're still talking about that before we come out with any specific ideas?
DR. RICE: Well, the President wants to keep this Cabinet-level working group continuing to work, because he feels that we have learned a great deal, that we have some good ideas, that we are getting a better sense for what the science does tell us and what the science does not tell us, and that ultimately, this is going to lead to better policy. But we are not through with the work, and we would be wrong to represent that we are through with the work.
This is a complex problem. It's a far more complex problem than one usually reads on the pages of the newspaper. And I think we understand its complexities. Addressing it is also a complex set of issues. So the President is going to keep this group working, and with his allies he'll talk a little bit about what we've learned thus far.
Q: You're not saying that the President is going to Europe with this buddy-buddy attitude when there's been so much hostility in the things that he's said. They don't really feel that he is on board with them or on the same page on Star Wars or everything else. So he's got a lot of fence-mending to do, doesn't he? I mean, the whole question of the whole missile defense, it doesn't work yet, and yet you're going to unveil it as our defense?
DR. RICE: Well, Helen, first of all, I want to say very clearly that the President is talking about a new strategic framework for dealing with threats of today, not the threats of yesterday. It is not 1972 --
Q: Right, but he doesn't have a system that works yet.
DR. RICE: It is not 1972. What we are embarking on and have told the allies that we wish to embark on is a comprehensive research-development, testing and evaluation program of many promising ideas. Some will accelerate; some will drop by the wayside. But this needs to be seen not just in the context of what we do about missile defense, but what we do about addressing the threats that are really there today.
This is not an era in which the Russians, pointing thousands of nuclear warheads at the United States on high stages of alert, with concerns about a Soviet conventional attack in Europe, is anything like the current situation. So the President is going to talk about the new security environment.
As to how he's received in Europe, I have sat in every meeting that he's had with European leaders. I've been there when he's made the telephone calls. These are friendly, respectful, outgoing relationships. And he's going to have a chance to renew them. The notion somehow that we have tremendous tensions with our European allies I think are, frankly, just not right.
Q: How can you say that? On global warming, on --
DR. RICE: Of course, we have policy differences on a number of issues. Not, by the way, on missile defense. There, the allies have made very clear that they appreciate the consultations that are going on, that they expect those consultations to continue. The NATO communique says that, yes, there are new threats to worry about. And so we have a lot of work to do with our allies, but, you know, the common values here, and the common agenda, far out-weighs policy differences that we have.
Q: The President is not going to be going to the Balkans, but do you expect him to make some statement about the pace or the prospect of withdrawal of U.S. troops?
DR. RICE: The President's been very clear that we are going to honor our commitments in the Balkans; that he understands that we went in together, that we will eventually come out together. What we have been talking to our allies about -- and I think everybody believes that this is appropriate -- is as conditions do change on the ground, what do we do about the troop presence, about the structure of our troops, and how do we get on with the business of building civilian institutions like police forces and a functioning judicial system that can actually be the bedrock of stable democracy in Bosnia-Hercegovina, or ultimately in Kosovo.
A lot has changed in the Balkans, including the election of a democratic government in Belgrade, and so we do have to keep assessing the circumstances. But the President has made very clear he has no deadline and that he's going to honor our commitments in the Balkans.
Q: Could you elaborate on what the President is going to be advancing or possibly proposing on AIDS? And could you also possibly react to a proposal today by Congressman Hyde, the Chairman of the International Relations Committee, which would put forward about a 50-percent increase in the funding for U.S. support for other countries dealing with HIV-AIDS?
DR. RICE: Outside of Africa? Essentially Africa, yes. I have not seen the Hyde proposal and, I'm sorry, so I can't really react to that. I know that Chairman Hyde has been very interested in this problem, and we've, indeed, talked about it. There's a lot of support on the Hill for doing something about the scourge of AIDS.
The President outlined his approach when he had Secretary General Annan here and President Obasanjo of Nigeria. And it is an approach that is comprehensive in the way we go about it. It recognizes that yes, treatment is an important issue, but so, too, is education and prevention; so, too, are health delivery systems that can actually carry out the rather complicated regimen that one needs to treat AIDS.
I think that perhaps Secretary General Kofi Annan said it best when he talked about the tremendous leadership that the United States had shown in being the first to respond to his call for a global fund to deal with infectious diseases like AIDS, tuberculosis and other such diseases.
The President will talk more about the need for accountability, for knowing what works, for having ways to measure the progress that we're getting. But most of all, I think he will join, hopefully, the allies in putting forth a real effort to deal with this scourge. And I might just want to note again, the United States already provides almost half of the funding internationally for AIDS. So it is a challenge, in a sense, to others to also come along.
Q: A question on the summit with the Russian President. Do I understand you correctly that no policy documents are expected to come out of that summit? And more generally, what outcome of the summit would you describe as a credible success to the Americans, to the Russians, and to the Europeans?
DR. RICE: I believe that the success of this summit is going to be seen in the long term. And that is that what we really are doing here is establishing a foundation with these two Presidents in their personal relationship that can help us to promote a constructive and realistic relationship with Russia going forward. No, we're not expecting major agreements here. This is, after all, a two-hour meeting of the two men. But we felt that it was time to go ahead and do this, to get them to start to get to know each other, to have them lay out a vision of how we see the relationship unfolding, and so I think that it will be successful, because I would speculate or I would guess that these two men will find that they have a lot in common in what they view as a successful U.S.-Russian relationship.
Of course, there will be disagreements. I know that it's sometimes better to write about the disagreements. But, you know, countries do disagree about some things. It doesn't mean that it's a fundamentally hostile relationship or that it's a relationship of enemies. Russia is a big power going through a major transition. I think the President wants to signal his support for having a Russia that is really a part of Europe, that is a respected partner in international politics, and they will talk about that as well.
Q: Dr. Rice, in diplomatic circles and in meetings with the President, how frequently do our European allies raise the issue of their governmental opposition to the death penalty? And do you see any possible awkwardness next week in the possibility that the U.S. will carry out the death penalty in a very high-profile case on the same day the President leaves for his trip to Europe?
DR. RICE: The death penalty has not been raised in a single meeting between the President and a head of state. I believe that our allies probably understand that this is a matter for the American government, its democratically-elected government with the American people to be concerned about. We are an open and democratic society, we have debates about the death penalty. Reasonable people disagree about the death penalty. But it is a matter for America's democracy, not a matter for international negotiation.
Q: With the 2002 target for the next round of NATO expansion coming up, do you expect that to come up in the discussions with the allies, and particularly with President Putin?
DR. RICE: I believe that it will certainly come up with the allies. It is, after all, NATO's business to decide when and where and how to take in new members. And so I suspect that there will be discussions there. It will probably also come up in the EU context because NATO and the EU are the two great European institutions and, of course, they have different profiles and different circumstances for entry. But obviously, in talking about the European Project, building a Europe whole and free and at peace, they both have their role to play. So I would expect it would come up there, too.
I think what the President will make clear in both those stops as well as when he talks to President Putin is that this really is a matter for NATO to decide. The United States believes strongly that enlargement needs to continue. It is only natural that enlargement will continue, that we believe strongly that there should be no red lines, geographic or historic, that eliminate any country as a fait accompli, and that we believe that there can be no veto by any country over NATO enlargement.
The final thing that he will make clear, though, is that anyone who wants to eventually become a member of NATO has to meet certain criteria. And there are membership action plans out with a number of states, and so fulfilling those is really very important.
Q: Going to Slovenia, does that indicate we believe Slovenia has met those standards?
DR. RICE: No. Nobody has been invited yet. Slovenia is a country that is making a lot of great strides. It seems to be a very good place to meet the Russian President and also to meet the Slovenes. Because frankly, in the Balkan story, Slovenia is a pretty remarkable success story.
Q: Dr. Rice, do you think -- first of all, were you accurately quoted in The Journal today about the administration's backing away from the Kyoto Accord? Do you believe that the administration could have better handled its withdrawal?
DR. RICE: What I think I said is that the President had made clear when he was a candidate that he did not believe the Kyoto Protocol addressed the problem of climate change in a way that the United States could support. He had the backing, by the way, of a Senate that was under no means prepared to ratify such an accord, and I think if you really look at the history of what was going on, nobody was ready to bring that treaty up for ratification because of the way that it was.
In retrospect, perhaps the fact that we understood that we had already said this was not immediately observable to everybody, and it might have been better to let people know again, in advance, including our allies, that we were not going to support the protocol. But as I said to European ambassadors, I was surprised that anyone was surprised.
Q: Dr. Rice, following up on this question, can you outline, at least at this date, what the President's principles are for a new Kyoto treaty or a new opening to discuss it? What are his principles?
DR. RICE: I think you will have an opportunity to hear this as well prepare for the European trip in one way or another. Let me say, the Cabinet-level working group is still working on what it wishes to say to the President before we go to Europe, and so I don't want to try to prefigure that. But the President's been clear about a few things.
First, he's been very clear that the problems with Kyoto could not be repeated in any further international effort. And so, one would want to be certain that developing countries were accounted for in some way, that technology and science really ought to be important parts of this answer, that we cannot do something that damages the American economy or other economies because growth is also important.
But it is also very clear that this is a President who takes extremely seriously what we do know about climate change, which is essentially that there is warming taking place. But he takes it seriously enough to also want to understand better what we don't know. It is the reason that he has worked very, very hard to put this Cabinet group together; that we've spent so much time understanding the science; that we've had experts in to help us understand what we do know and what we don't know, so that you can have intelligent policies that balance, given what we do and do not know about this problem.
Q: To follow up, in terms of timing, when would we expect, or when would the President -- Cabinet-level group? Maybe by G-8?
DR. RICE: Well, I think we don't want to set a time limit on it. It is working; it is continuing to work. I might note that even as this goes on, I think it will continue to work well into the future. I mean, one of the advantages of having this particular Cabinet group together is that you can look at the potential for agriculture and sequestration to play a role in dealing with emissions; that you can look at the effects on the economy as a whole, when you have both Larry Lindsey and Paul O'Neill sitting at the table; that you can look at concerns about energy supply when you have Spence Abraham at the table; and you can look at what we might want to do with our allies if you have Colin Powell there. So you could think of this as an ongoing way to address the problem.
Now, I think that there will be interim reports along the way, but we're taking this seriously enough that we're not just going to slap something together and say, okay, that's it. We think it's a problem that has many dimensions and deserves serious attention over an extended period of time.
Q: Dr. Rice, about the President's missile defense plan, Japan's new Foreign Minister has criticized the President's proposal, at least on several occasions. Are you disappointed? Are you willing to talk with him about the missile defense system?
DR. RICE: Well, of course, we're willing to talk with the Foreign Minister of Japan about the new strategic security framework. I must say that we've heard from the Japanese government that there is a willingness to listen and to continue to consult. Let me be very clear: We have not asked anybody to come out and say, oh yes, we woke up this morning and we think this is all a great idea to change the way that we think about nuclear weapons. That would be too much to expect. There's a lot on the table, and we're continuing to consult. And of course, we'll consult with the Japanese Foreign Minister as well.
Q: Dr. Rice, a question on some breaking news. Can you confirm that the U.S. will reopen negotiations with North Korea on a broad range of issues, including dealing with the troublesome issue of nuclear weapons?
DR. RICE: As you know, the Secretary of State is going to meet with the Korean Foreign Minister tomorrow. The President will issue a statement a little bit later tonight.
Q: Is that a confirmation?
DR. RICE: The President will issue a statement a little bit later tonight. You'll have to wait to see what it says.
Q: A question on the trip. How did you interpret the Secretary of State's ability to deal with the NATO foreign ministers on the question of missile defense? There was some language he specifically proposed that they did not endorse, and some of the communique changed what NATO had historically said about missile defense and about the ABM Treaty itself. What is your general assessment of what happened there and how does that set the table for this trip?
DR. RICE: I thought it was an enormously successful session for the Alliance. As a matter of fact, I think Lord Robertson went on the record to say that he believed that the characterization of what had happened in that meeting and the drafting of the communique was 180 degrees wrong, to paraphrase.
And it is true that for the first time, there is no mention of the ABM Treaty at all, let alone as a cornerstone of strategic stability. And so, you have to take that as a clear indication that the Alliance is moving on, that it understands that while there is a transition to be made, and while it understands that, and we understand that people believe that the treaty continues to be an issue, that people are listening when we say that the ABM Treaty can not only not be the cornerstone of strategic stability, but it is an impediment to getting to a new foundation for security in the modern era.
So I thought that -- I judge it as having been very successful, and it does lay the groundwork of continuing to move this ball forward. But I just want to emphasize, nobody expects breakthroughs on any given day, most especially so early in the process. We are early in the process of consultation.
Q: Dr. Rice, can I follow that? The reporting I've seen indicates that the language on the ABM was removed because we objected to it, and NATO being a consensus organization, it could not be included unless we went along with it. Is that inaccurate?
DR. RICE: I think that if you listen very hard to what Lord Robertson says, that Lord Robertson does not see this as having been the United States pitching a fit, and therefore getting some language that he wants.
Lord Robertson says that the reports that were out there about how the United States did not get language that it wanted, how this was all very contentious, he says this was respectful, this was a dialogue, and I think that that is exactly how this took place.
Now, all that I'm saying -- I've said that there are still people who believe in the importance of the ABM Treaty; nobody is -- we're not fooling ourselves in that regard. But in moving forward little by little -- and I would point you in this regard to the joint statements that were made with Prime Minister Blair, with Chancellor Schroeder, with the Japanese Prime Minister, with the South Korean President, all of which talk about a new offense-defense mix and working on the new threat environment -- this intellectual argument is moving forward and I think that we are at this stage very pleased in where we're going.
Q: Is it inaccurate, Dr. Rice, that a majority of the members of NATO wished to keep the language and the U.S. and perhaps Britain objected and, because -- and not in a contentious way, but simply because NATO is a consensus organization --
DR. RICE: I'm not going to give you a head count, but the United States was not alone in thinking that this was the right way to characterize the current situation.
Q: And his question on majority?
DR. RICE: Yes, all the way in back.
Q: Dr. Rice, you talk about -- you said earlier that countries -- people need to understand that countries do have their differences. But can you clarify one difference about the Bush administration, when the President's top trade negotiator, Bob Zoellick, said one day earlier, he said that it would be a constructive step if Taiwan's President can attend the APEC Summit, while today, the State Department seems to have said the opposite way, saying that Taiwan can only be represented by its senior economic official. Where does the President stand on this issue? Can Taiwan's president attend the APEC summit, or not?
DR. RICE: We have been very clear about the way that the President views the situation in the Taiwan Straits, including that we do not believe
in a change in the status quo unilaterally by either side, that we don't believe in any change by force. And I think you would find that Chen Shui-bian was treated with the kind of respect when he came to the United States that we think should be accorded to a democratically-elected leader.
But the matter of who attends the APEC summit, we don't expect any change in what has traditionally been U.S. policy at the APEC summit, which is the highest-ranking economic official.
MS. COUNTRYMAN: Last question.
Q: A question about Russia, please. This is your area.
DR. RICE: Listen, since I did this, I'll go there and there. How's that?
Q: Thank you. As you know, India approves the President's NMD, and you had spoken with the Defense Minister of India when he was here, and also you called him. But also, India is saying that China is a threat to the region as far as security and peace is concerned, because it's building up. Don't you think China is really a threat to the U.S. in the future? And if this is -- discussed between the two Presidents, also Afghanistan.
DR. RICE: We do not see -- we are not out to find a threat in the region. And what we are trying to do with China is to build a constructive relationship with China that would allow us to continue to support what is a very important fundamental transition that is going on in China. That is why the President has been so supportive of normal trade relations with China, of WTO accession for China, and a lot is going on in China domestically.
Now, it is true that we don't always see eye to eye with China about other matters, including security issues sometimes. In the Asia Pacific, for instance, we've made very clear to the Chinese that we're not leaving the region, that the United States is a stabilizing presence. But, for instance, on North Korea, there has not been tension with China.
So I think that it is by no means a picture of a threat. It is a China that has interests that are sometimes coincident with ours and sometimes not. It's true of normal relations between mature powers, and I think that we are working hard toward a constructive relationship with China that would benefit, obviously, peace and security in the Asia Pacific region.
Q: Dr. Rice, just to follow, are you going to discuss China and Afghanistan during the discussions?
DR. RICE: Well, with our allies, of course, we'll discuss any place on the globe that is of interest to them and I suspect that U.S.-China relations will come up. And most certainly, I would think that the problems that we have with the Taliban and Afghanistan will come up.
Q: Can you elaborate, Dr. Rice, on the vision that the President has for the future of U.S.-Russian relations? What does the United States want from them, this administration, other than acquiescence in the modification of the ABM Treaty? What does the President have to offer them in terms of incentives?
DR. RICE: Well, I think the greatest incentive for Russia to be a modern power that is internally reformed, democratic, economically open and marketable is that that would be the true source of Russian power for the future. And so it's not an incentive that we offer the Russians. It is that for Russia, that is the course for full acceptance and for being able to deal in the world in a way that is not a 19th century way of dealing with the world.
And I think that in some sense, Putin understands that. He understands that economic reforms do have to go forward. I am not always so certain on the democratic reform side. But obviously, the modern democratic state is the model that is succeeding. And so the incentive to Russia is to become the modern democratic state so that it can play its rightful role as a great power.
We in the United States have every reason to want that Russia to exist. We understand that it's mostly on the basis of choices that the Russians themselves will make, not choices that we will make. But of course, to the degree that a U.S.-Russian economic dialogue helps, to the degree that our support for Russian accession to the WTO when it meets the criteria helps with that process, we are prepared to offer that support.
We want to be supportive of the burgeoning civic society in Russia. I'm a university former provost and professor; I can tell you that one of the most important things that has happened since the collapse of the Soviet Union are the scores of Russian students that are studying in the United States, the easy exchange of peoples back and forth. That's an important part of the transformation that Russia is going to make.
And finally, the President will sit down, state to state, to talk about areas of potential cooperation on a new strategic security framework on regions of the world. We've cooperated in the Balkans; we've cooperated in the Nagorno-Karabakh. The Russians have been positive in the Middle East in these last -- since we have been in office. It is most certainly a broad relationship that we have with Russia. Russia is, after all, a big and important power. And it's not surprising, therefore, that it's a complex relationship. Some things we will agree on; some things we will disagree on. But there is no reason that Russia has to reemerge as a strategic adversary for the United States.
And that is really what the President is saying to President Putin. That is why he wants to move the security relationship on to a different footing, because this is now becoming a normal relationship with Russia, not the abnormal relationship that we had with the Soviet Union.
Thank you very much. Oh, I should mention, Dan Fried, who is the Special Assistant for Eurasian, will stay behind to answer any questions, on background, if you've got them.

George W. Bush,"June 14, 2001",Göteborg Statement: Summit of the United States of America and the European Union,"Today in Göteborg, we, the leaders of the United States and the European Union, reaffirm our historic partnership. Our relationship is founded on strong and enduring ties between our peoples and shared fundamental values, including respect for human rights and individual liberty, democratic government and economic freedoms.
What unites us far outweighs that which divides us. From this foundation, we are determined to forge a common and cooperative approach to the complex and changing global environment in which we live and the new challenges we face. Experience has taught us that, when the U.S. and EU work hand-in-hand, either bilaterally or multilaterally, we can be an engine for positive global change, nurturing the development of democratic regimes, opening trade and investment, working to reduce poverty, and protecting the environment.
Today's meeting takes place under conditions few of our ancestors could have imagined. The European-American bond of the last two generations has forged a great peace—rooted in democracy, free markets and human rights—that is our responsibility to preserve, deepen and extend. We renew our commitment to address in concert the most pressing bilateral, regional and global issues of the day.
Strengthening Our Transatlantic Bond
We are determined to strengthen our transatlantic bond. We agree that, for our partnership to be a stable platform for our common global agenda, we must address our differences honestly and seek, in good faith, constructive solutions. This we intend to do.
The U.S. and EU enjoy one of the deepest economic relationships in the world— the vast majority of trade and investment flows in an open, unfettered manner across the Atlantic. When this is not the case, we agree that consultation, rather than litigation, should be the preferred method of managing our disagreements. Moreover, we resolve to settle our trade disagreements more quickly and effectively. We are also determined to work together to explore ways to achieve this objective, including through mediation, and to redouble our efforts to find practical and mutually acceptable solutions to all outstanding trade disputes, in accordance with WTO rules. In this context, we welcome in particular the agreement to resolve the dispute on bananas. Furthermore, we reaffirm our determination to comply with recommendations of the WTO Dispute Settlement Body.
The EU is working to acquire a civilian and military crisis management capability, which will reinforce the Union's ability to contribute to international peace and security in accordance with the principles of the UN Charter and make the EU a stronger, more capable partner in deterring and managing crises, thereby also enhancing the security of the Transatlantic Community. The U.S. welcomes the efforts of the EU to strengthen its capabilities and to develop the ability to manage crises, including through military operations, where NATO as a whole is not engaged, and in a manner that is fully coordinated, where NATO interests are involved, and transparent with NATO, and that provides for the fullest possible participation of non-EU European allies. In particular, the commitments made by the EU Member States concerning military capabilities will, as they are implemented, strengthen both the EU and the European pillar of the Atlantic Alliance.
One of the unique aspects of our relationship is the development of transatlantic civil society dialogues. We will continue to benefit from their advice and perspective as we confront the challenges of the future. We encourage efforts to intensify the Transatlantic Legislators Dialogue between the European Parliament and the Congress of the United States, a dialogue which brings our peoples closer together.
Working to Promote Peace and Prosperity in Regions throughout the World
We remain committed to forging innovative solutions to resolve conflicts and will continue to promote peace, stability, democracy and economic renewal throughout the world.
We are gravely concerned by the developments in the Middle East. We welcome and support the report by the Sharm el-Sheikh Fact-Finding Committee. We urge both sides to implement the report's recommendations, in all aspects, including ending the violence, taking confidencebuilding measures and resuming negotiations. We welcome the constructive initiative taken by Egypt and Jordan to that end. We see no alternative to a negotiated solution based on UN Resolutions 242 and 338, and the principle of land for peace. We will continue to cooperate closely to promote peace in the region.
In recent months, we have strengthened our already close collaboration to bring peace, stability, democracy and economic renewal to South East Europe. We welcome the positive developments in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. In Bosnia-Herzegovina, we call upon all partners to contribute actively to the full implementation of the Dayton agreement, which remains the key element in building a lasting peace. In Kosovo, we welcome the promulgation of the constitutional framework for provisional self-government as a major step in building a peaceful, multi-ethnic and democratic society. We urge the people of Kosovo to condemn the use of violence and isolate extremists. In the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, we will continue to coordinate our efforts to promote a political solution to the current crisis. In this context, we support the political reform dialogue and look forward to a report in the coming days. In cooperation with NATO and OSCE, we have responded quickly and firmly to threats to peace in the region. Together, we are endeavoring to prevent extremism from undermining the democratic process and stress the need for political, not military, solutions.
We reaffirm our support for the Stability Pact for South East Europe. In order to encourage the countries of the region to promote democracy, the rule of law, protection of minorities, the inviolability of international borders and regional reconciliation and cooperation, we will continue to engage all States in the region through the Stability Pact and, in the case of the EU, also within the framework of the Stabilization and Association Process. Our objective will be to encourage political and economic reforms, among them those designed to enhance private sector investment in the region, in order to ensure long-term economic renewal. We urge all governments in the region to cooperate with the International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia in bringing war criminals to justice.
We fully support President Kim Dae-Jung's policy for peace and reconciliation on the Korean peninsula. We discussed the results of the EU high-level mission to the two Koreas and affirmed the importance of the DPRK leadership's adherence to its commitment to maintain the moratorium on missile tests and to continue the process initiated at the inter-Korean Summit We also discussed the U.S. decision to enter into a serious discussion with North Korea on a broad agenda, which was welcomed by the EU. We agree that the inter-Korean dialogue and cooperation, non-proliferation and human rights will remain issues of vital importance for further progress in developing our ties with the DPRK.
We recognize the progress made since 1991 and emphasize the importance to Europe, to the transatlantic community and the world of Russia's full transition into a democratic, free market state, enjoying constructive relations with its neighbors and close ties to the transatlantic community. We pledge to continue working together and with Russia towards that goal, and will pursue a dialogue with Russia that is constructive, cooperative and, where warranted, frank. We are concerned about recent adverse developments regarding media, which should remain independent and free of interference. We call upon the Russian Government to pursue actively a political settlement to the conflict in Chechnya.
The U.S. and EU strongly support an independent, sovereign Ukraine with close ties to the transatlantic community but are concerned about domestic developments affecting democratic and free market reforms. We support Ukraine's leaders in their pursuit of reforms that secure Ukraine's future prosperity and urge them to continue to follow this path. We remind Ukraine of the need to send a strong signal to the international community by responding positively and transparently to concerns over human rights, independent media and free elections.
We will intensify our political dialogue on the Southern Caucasus, where enhanced stability is a common interest. In that regard, the U.S. and EU remain committed to strengthening Georgia's sovereignty, independence, and transition to democracy and free market economy. We urge all sides in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict to continue their efforts to find a peaceful settlement based on mutual compromise.
Reaffirming Our Global Responsibilities and Commitments
We share a unique responsibility to confront issues of global concern and impact, and today we reiterated our commitment to address growing global challenges.
We are committed to launching an ambitious new round of multilateral trade negotiations at the WTO Ministerial Meeting in Doha, and, in our high level discussions in recent weeks, have made progress towards this shared goal. We seek a round that will lead both to the further liberalization of world trade and to clarifying, strengthening and extending WTO rules, so as to promote economic growth and equip the trading system to meet the challenges of globalization. The new round must equally address the needs and priorities of developing countries, demonstrate that the trading system can respond to the concerns of civil society, and promote sustainable development. We will work closely together and with our partners in the coming weeks to secure consensus to launch a round based on this substantive and forward looking agenda.
We also welcome the steady progress made so far on WTO implementation and are ready to examine ways to make further progress in connection with the launch of a new round of trade negotiations. We will also reinforce and improve our provision of technical assistance to build capacity, including capacity to support negotiations, in developing countries, so as to aid both their implementation of WTO agreements and help them to integrate more fully into the trading system, including the dispute settlement mechanism. Finally, we will continue to make efforts to secure the early accession of candidate countries to the WTO, with particular attention to the specific situation of least developed countries. This will make the WTO a truly universal organization.
Recalling that the dispute settlement mechanism of the WTO is a central element in providing security and predictability to the multilateral trading system, the U.S. and EU undertake to work constructively to improve that mechanism.
We agree on the need for an integrated and comprehensive approach to confront the diseases HIV/Aids, Malaria and Tuberculosis, particularly in Africa, emphasizing prevention in a continuum of treatment and care, and spurring research and development. We support the establishment of a global fund to fight these diseases. We are also working together to ensure the success of upcoming events, such as the UN General Assembly Special Session on HIV/ AIDS in promoting an effective global response to this scourge. We welcome the steps taken by the pharmaceutical industry to make drugs more affordable. In the context of the new global fund, we will work with the pharmaceutical industry and with affected countries to facilitate the broadest possible provision of drugs in an affordable and medically effective manner.
We celebrate the important contributions migrants have made to our countries. Respect for the individual right to seek asylum is also an essential democratic value of our societies. Therefore, we underline the importance of a comprehensive and integrated approach to asylum and migration based on a common commitment to human rights, existing international agreements, and support for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. We will focus on a broad range of issues related to asylum, illegal immigration and mass influxes of refugees and displaced persons.
We emphasize the need to take mutually reinforcing action in response to common problems in fighting international crime. We have, therefore, launched multi-annual cooperation in several areas, such as trafficking in human beings, cybercrime and crime related to drugs.
We had an interesting and open dialogue here in Go¨teborg on climate change, which will continue. We recognize that climate change is a pressing issue that requires a global solution. The U.S. and the EU are both committed to providing strong leadership on climate change. Prompt, effective and sustainable action is needed, consistent with the ultimate objective of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) of stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. We are determined to meet our national commitments and our obligations under the UNFCCC through a variety of flexible means, drawing on the power of markets and technology. In this context, we agree on the importance of intensifying cooperation on climate-related science and research. We disagree on the Kyoto Protocol and its ratification, but we are determined to work together in all relevant fora to address climate change and will participate constructively in the resumed COP 6 in Bonn. Our efforts must ultimately result in an outcome that protects the environment and ensures economic growth compatible with our shared objective of sustainable development for present and future generations.
Looking to the Future
We have also taken a fresh look at the mechanisms of U.S.-EU cooperation in the context of the changing global environment. Whether working together to resolve disagreements, promote peace among our neighbors or combat threats to the broader world, we seek greater results. To focus our attention and efforts on elements in our common agenda where progress is both necessary and possible, we have selected the following strategic themes for cooperation over the next several years, keeping in mind the need for flexibility in responding to unforeseen events. Within these themes, we have identified immediate priorities on which we seek tangible progress before our next Summit.
Addressing security challenges: Preventing conflict and managing crises; fighting terrorism; promoting non-proliferation;
Promoting Growth and a Multilateral Trading System: Reaching agreement on the scope of the new round and working together to solicit support for the agreement in the run-up to the WTO Ministerial in Doha;
Fighting Crime: Cooperating in fighting trafficking in human beings, drugs and cybercrime;
Protecting the Environment: Promoting effective ways to address climate change;
Fighting against poverty in the developing countries: Combating the communicable diseases HIV/Aids, Malaria and Tuberculosis.
Promoting the Digital Economy and making its benefits available to all citizens will be an important strategic theme for our dialogue for the years to come.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/goteborg-statement-summit-the-united-states-america-and-the-european-union
George W. Bush,"June 16, 2001",Press Briefing by Secretary of State Colin Powell and National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice,"Hotel Korsk
Brdo Pri Kranju, Slovenia
6:30 P.M. (L)
SECRETARY POWELL: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Dr. Rice and I are pleased to be with you, to spend a few moments answering your questions.
I just might begin by saying that I believe today's meeting between President Bush and President Putin was a fitting capstone to the Week of Europe, as we call it in the National Security Council and State Department, where President Bush had a chance to travel widely across the continent, beginning in Spain, where we reinforced the bilateral relationship that we have with Spain; continuing on to NATO, where he had the opportunity at the North Atlantic council for the first time to meet with all his fellow heads in government -- government and state of NATO, and to explain his thoughts with respect to America's continuing role in Europe, to emphasize the fact that we went into the Balkans together and we will come out together; to have an opportunity to express his ideas on a strategic framework for the future -- a future that is quite different than the past we have come out of, as we have come out of the Cold War era.
And then on to Goteborg, where he had a chance to meet with members of the European Union, and they had frank discussions with respect to global climate change. And then on down to Warsaw, where in a remarkable day yesterday we saw an outpouring of affection and support, not just for the President, but for Polish-U.S. relations. And I think the President gave a landmark speech yesterday, with respect to our belief in the future of Europe and the fact that we seek no enemies and there are no enemies, in our view, any longer, behind what used to be the Iron Curtain.
And then, finally, here today, where these two gentlemen had the chance to take the measure of each other, to express their hopes and aspirations concerning the future of the relationship between Russia and the United States.
So I think it's been an excellent week and I'm glad it ended in this very, very fine way, here in Slovenia. And let me express our appreciation to the authorities, the leaders here in Slovenia for the hospitality they've extended to us.
The meeting was about an hour and 40 minutes, just the two of them, with interpreters and note-takers. And Dr. Rice was a note-taker, so she has much more information and insight as to the meeting than I did -- or, I do -- I was in a separate meeting with Foreign Minister Inanov, and then we assembled, all of us, in a final short plenary meeting of about 15 minutes.
With that, I would invite your questions and Dr. Rice and I will field them, depending on the nature of the question.
Q: Mr. Secretary, your career was spent, as you've noted, in a time of blue lines and red lines on the map. I wonder if you could tell us what kind of a moment it was for you when Putin read that 1954 directive, and what it said to you about the prospects for future NATO-Russia cooperation?
SECRETARY POWELL: Well, I think there is every opportunity for future NATO-Russia cooperation. I did spend most of my life looking at the red side of the map from the blue side of the map, separated by an Iron Curtain. But some years ago, I had Dr. Rice's job, and I watched that whole thing disappear. And I watched the world become a mosaic of changing colors and parts.
And now I am so pleased to be the Secretary of State as I see that change continue, and I look forward to a productive relationship with Russia. There is no reason, as both Presidents noted, that we cannot be friends, that we cannot be partners, that we cannot cooperate in a number of different spheres, that we can't help each other move forward into the 21st century.
So as an old soldier, I was deeply moved by not only the activities of today, the meetings of today, but everything I have seen this week. I have been this week in places that used to just be on my target list in the old days. And now they are part of a free Europe, a Europe founded on democratic principles and values, and I'm pleased that I'm still around to be a part of it.
Q: Sir, can you tell us, when do you intend to start your consultations with Mr. Ivanov on the new security framework, and this will include missile defense?
SECRETARY POWELL: We'll begin rather quickly. Foreign Minister Ivanov and I will have overall responsibility for it, but there will be parts underneath that where the Defense Department will be our lead agency working directly with their ministry of defense. And Dr. Rice and I will set up our committees in consultation with Minister Ivanov and Minister Ivanov, and I would hope to see these consultations begin as quickly as possible.
So we're anxious to move ahead. And Foreign Minister Ivanov and I talked about it again today. I don't have a specific date for you.
Q: Mr. Secretary, to paraphrase President Putin, he said the 1972 ABM Treaty lies at the center, or the cornerstone, in his words, of the modern architecture of arms control. Can you give us a sense -- we had a pretty good sense before this meeting -- how wide the gap was between the two countries on that issue? Did it narrow any significantly today, and how do you go from here?
SECRETARY POWELL: I think I may ask Dr. Rice to talk to this, because she was in the room. But I think both sides laid out their position. I don't share President Putin's view that it remains at the center of the entire arms control structure or the entire strategic framework that exists between our two nations.
It was a treaty that was written for the time of the red and the blue map of 30-odd years ago, and I think it is quite appropriate, in light of a new world, in light of changed circumstances, to review anything that is from that era to see if it is still relevant, and why not talk about changing it.
It was interesting that President Putin made that point, but he also said, now let's get into a dialogue to see what it is that we think should be updated. So at the same time that he held his position, he also invited dialogue.
Q: Dr. Rice, if you would expand on that, please?
DR. RICE: Yes. I would also say that there was a great deal of interest on the Russian side and the question of new and common threats, and I think a desire to explore that further. As you know, President Putin has said publicly several times that he believes that there are new threats, and that was expressed again today in the meeting with the President.
He also said in his press conference, a new security architecture. And so I think we'll have serious consultations, discussions about what constitutes now that new security architecture. But I think there is an openness to dialogue, there is an openness to discussion, and I felt that they established a very good basis to move forward.
Q: On that dialogue, did the gap close any in the differences of opinion on the ABM Treaty and its centrality?
DR. RICE: Well, as the Secretary said, they had an hour and 40 minutes together, and then an additional 15 minutes. But they covered a wide variety of subjects. It would be a mistake to think that even the bulk of this conversation was about missile defense or the ABM Treaty; it was not. It was about a whole wide range of issues. This was one small part of the discussion, and they did not try, as the President said, to get into a negotiating session about trying to close the gap.
But I think it is also important to note that they gave experts -- both the Secretaries of the Foreign Ministry and State and the Defense Secretaries -- a desire to go now and talk about concrete issues.
Q: Dr. Rice and Secretary Powell, during the campaign, Bush seemed to be very skeptical about Russia, especially compared to the Clinton administration, and critical of the way the Clinton administration tended to personalize relations between the countries, and embodied in their two leaders.
It seemed today that we were witnessing a personalization of diplomacy in a way that maybe you criticized in the past. I'm wondering, I mean, they seem to have had a very warm meeting, they talked about how they trusted each other. How do you look at that now? And, also, any other atmospherics for those magazine writers in the room that you could provide would be great.
DR. RICE: Doing the work for all of you, all right? (Laughter.)
On the issue of personalization, no one has ever said that it's not a good thing for the President of Russia and the President of the United States to have a good, warm relationship, to be able to look each other in the eye and to expect each other to be straightforward. That was never the issue.
The issue was whether or not the United States started to equate reform with Boris Yeltsin. And I think you heard something very important, actually, from President Putin that I don't remember hearing earlier in the history of U.S.-Russian relations, because he took full responsibility for creating conditions in Russia in which economic capital would begin to flow to Russia.
He talked about the work that Russia had to do. And I think that the United States can clearly try to be a partner; the United States can be supportive; we can send the Secretary of Commerce and Treasury and trade representatives and support Russia in WTO accession when it is ready. But we cannot do the Russian's work for them. And I think that was the tone of this meeting.
This President has been very clear that he wants a good relationship with President Putin, but that he's going to be realistic both about those things about which we agree and those things about which we disagree. And he did so, the two of them, in an atmosphere that was respectful and, frankly, quite straightforward.
Q: Did you hear in anything President Putin said or as what we're seeing emerges, the possibility that there could be some kind of agreement and embrace of the ABM that would allow us to do what we want and would allow them to have the sort of reassurances that they seem to --
DR. RICE: Well, Frank, as I said, they only talked about this issue for a period of time with the President kind of allaying out a vision. But I do believe that they are open to discussions and I believe that both the Secretary and I have said to you that we are open to discussions about what constitutes the new security framework.
We are quite convinced that it's time for the world to move on, pass the ABM Treaty, to deal with the new threats, to deal with offensive reductions, defensive forces that can contribute to deterrence and new nonproliferation efforts. And, by the way, they did spend a good deal of time on nonproliferation issues.
And so we believe that there is a new security framework to be had. Its form is really up for discussion. And I think they set in course a very high level set of discussions to get that done.
Q: I'm wondering what kind of talk there was between the two Presidents on actually reducing nuclear arsenals?
DR. RICE: Again, they did not talk in specifics. The President laid out the framework that you have heard him lay out. President Putin listened, said that he looked forward to further discussions. But they didn't get into details.
Q: Did they agree on the basic idea that it was important to reduce nuclear arsenals on a general level?
DR. RICE: Well, I think we have known for some time that the Russian Federation feels strongly that nuclear reductions are in its interest, and the President has made clear that he believes that getting to a level that is consistent with our deterrent needs is important to us. So I don't think that there was anything there to bridge.
Q: Dr. Rice, Mr. Secretary, when President Putin said today that he agreed with President Bush that the U.S. and Russia can be good allies, is that meant, allies in the sense that the members of NATO are allies?
SECRETARY POWELL: Let's call it small ""a."" I think he was talking in terms of a partnership, friends, countries that could get together, that have mutual and shared interests, that can work together. I don't think he was talking about an alliance in the sense of a military alliance or a political alliance.
Q: Are you ruling that out?
SECRETARY POWELL: I'm not ruling anything in or our at the moment.
Q: Can I ask you to elaborate on your answer to Jay's question on the atmospherics? For example, who's idea was it to take a walk in the woods? Did the President enter the meeting intending to invite him to Crawford or did that just develop? I mean, what were the atmospherics?
DR. RICE: The President had said -- really it wasn't planned hours in advance. The President said, I would like to invite him to come to Washington, and I think on the spot then President Putin invited the President to come to Russia. It was a quite remarkable meeting in that it was both warm and straightforward. Sometimes meetings are warm because people are trying to blur differences. This was not the case. This was a case in which I think President Putin feels he had his say, in which President Bush felt that he had his say, but they maintained a kind of warmth about it, a kind of respect about it.
And, frankly, I think both men, I think, connected on a kind of sense of humor. The President mentioned the point about the daughters being named after mother-in-laws. That was kind of an interesting moment. But it was really not a very scripted meeting. It was a meeting in which the exchanges were long. There was a lot of dialogue between them on every issue. They went into depth on some issues; others, they left to their experts to do.
But it really was one of the more remarkable meetings of this kind that I've been in, because it was extremely straightforward. They did not blur their differences. The President brought up freedom of the press. The President brought up Chechnya. Mr. Putin brought up concerns that he had about the region to his south. They did not try to blur their differences, but it was still a very warm meeting.
Q: In his speech in Warsaw yesterday, the President seemed to put the United States' weight behind full membership of NATO. Did President Putin understand that speech in that way, and what was his general response to the possibility of the Balkan states coming into it?
DR. RICE: The President, in his speech in Poland, I think simply laid out some important principles, which were that he believes NATO should continue to expand. He and the allies, as Lord Robertson said, believe that something should happen at Prague. There cannot be a zero option at Prague. The President also clearly said that there should be no geographic and historical red-lines, and that no one has a veto. He did not bother -- he did not need to reiterate that to President Putin. President Putin had read the speech, he understood that.
But the President did reiterate that there was nothing for Russia to fear with Europe moving toward it, that this is an alliance of democracies and peace-loving states, and that he looked forward to a relationship that completely took cognizance of Russia's European-ness in much the way that he talked about in Poland. But President Putin did not comment directly on specific areas, specific questions that the President had raised -- or specific points that the President had made in Poland.
We'll miss the plane if we don't get out of here.
THE PRESS: Thank you.

George W. Bush,"June 16, 2001",The President's News Conference With President Vladimir Putin of Russia in Kranj,"President Bush. Good afternoon. President Putin and I have just concluded 2 hours of straightforward and productive meetings. We had a good discussion of our views of Russian-American relations and of the changing world at the beginnings of this new century. Our countries have common interests, and we share great responsibilities.
My meeting with President Putin today is an important step in building a constructive, respectful relationship with Russia, a relationship that has the potential to benefit not only our two countries but also the world. Russia is an important country with vast potential. When Russia and the United States work together in a constructive way, we can make the world a safer and more prosperous place.
I enjoyed the opportunity to meet President Putin in person for the first time. I am convinced that he and I can build a relationship of mutual respect and candor. And I'm convinced that it's important for the world that we do so.
More than a decade after the cold war ended, it is time to move beyond suspicion and toward straight talk, beyond mutually assured destruction and toward mutually earned respect. As we work together to address the world as it is, not as it used to be, it is important that we not only talk differently; we also must act differently.
We have great opportunities to cooperate on economic, commercial, regional, and security issues. President Putin and I have agreed to launch an extensive dialog about a wide range of issues that we can constructively address together.
We also discussed the importance of sound investment climate to improve Russia's future economic prosperity. I was so impressed that he was able to simplify his tax code in Russia with a flat tax. I'm not so sure I'll have the same success with our Congress.
We must continue a dialog, so I'm prepared to send both Secretary O'Neill and Secretary Evans to Moscow soon to further our discussions. I want to encourage Russian and American businesses to become more involved in our discussions, so that together, we can foster meaningful investments. President Putin agrees with this approach.
And we've agreed to launch regular detailed and serious consultations on the nature of our security relationship. I said to President Putin that we need a new approach for a new era, an approach that protects both our peoples and strengthens deterrence by exploring and developing our new attitudes toward defenses and missile defenses. I've directed Secretary of State Powell and Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld to work with their Russian counterparts to begin discussing a new security framework. I have invited President Putin to Washington this fall; he accepted. He invited me to Russia, and I accepted, and I look forward to the visit.
We also agreed to continue our cooperation and work toward common solutions on important regional issues, from the Balkans to Nagorno-Karabakh to Afghanistan. And we discussed our common interest in developing the energy resources of the Caspian Basin in a way that benefits all the countries of the region.
Respectful relations require honesty. And we did discuss areas where my country has differences with Russia, over Chechnya and over media relations. I also expressed my hope that Russia will develop constructive relations with its neighbors, like Georgia, that are trying to find their own way in a challenging but hopeful world.
This was a very good meeting. And I look forward to my next meeting with President Putin in July. I very much enjoyed our time together. He's an honest, straightforward man who loves his country. He loves his family. We share a lot of values. I view him as a remarkable leader. I believe his leadership will serve Russia well. Russia and America have the opportunity to accomplish much together; we should seize it. And today we have begun.
And finally, I'm especially pleased we're able to have this meeting in Slovenia, one of the success stories of Southeast Europe. In my meetings today with the President and the Prime Minister, I reaffirmed America's support for Slovenia's integration with Europe and the Euro-Atlantic community. I especially thank the people of Slovenia, and I want to thank the leadership for such warm hospitality and congratulate the people on the 10th anniversary of its independence on June the 25th.
I only regret not staying long enough to see Lake Bled or to climb Mount Triglav. Who knows, maybe I'll have the opportunity down the road.
Mr. President.
President Putin. First of all, I wanted to confirm everything that's been said by President Bush when he characterized our meeting. I could even add that I was counting on an open, frank dialog, confidential dialog. But in this regard, as they say in cases like this, reality was a lot bigger than expectations, because this was not only a confidential discussion but extremely and all the way to more than what you could expect from frankness, because President Bush, as a person who has studied history, proposed a very global, wide-scale approach and view to history. And it was very interesting and positive.
We sat, talked about the past, about the present, about the future of our countries and about the development of the situation in the world for many years into the future. This was really a very interesting discussion. I think that we found a good basis to start building on our cooperation. We're counting on a pragmatic relationship between Russia and the United States. We compared our approaches in key areas, and once again, we established our common ground.
I want to return now to what the President said very recently, that Russia and the United States are not enemies, they do not threaten each other, and they could be fully good allies. And taking into account the fact that the United States and the Russian Federation—as no one else, as no other country of the world—have accumulated huge amounts of nuclear weapons, weapons of mass destruction, we bear a special responsibility for maintaining the common peace and security in the world, for building a new architecture of security in the world.
All of this presupposes a very close cooperation for strengthening security in the 21st century. And saying this, any unilateral actions can only make more complicated various problems and issues.
One of the central topics of our discussion was the strengthening of strategic stability. We exchanged our views on our approaches. It was very important for me to hear how and what the President of the United States thinks and to hear directly from him.
In turn, naturally, I expressed the approaches of Russia in this sphere. The differences in approaches do exist, and naturally, in one short moment, it's impossible to overcome all of them. But I am convinced that ahead of us we have a constructive dialog and the will to talk about these topics, to discuss, to hear, to listen—to listen and to hear each other. And to my mind, this is very important.
The President and I have agreed that we're going to tell our Ministers of Defense, Secretaries of Defense, Foreign Ministers, to continue in this vein, to continue this discussion without any pauses.
Of course, we discussed some very difficult regional issues, the Near East and Afghanistan and the Balkans. I have to say that this discussion showed that the differences in our approaches in the very fundamental areas are much less than that which unites us. The differences in our positions, positions of the two countries, really are not of a fundamental nature, a global nature, something which cannot be solved—not at all. I think that it would be very incorrect for us to start forcing out issues and arguments and not take into account the very fundamental, main concepts and issues in our relationships, which are the basis and the whole foundation of the relationship between the Russian Federation and the United States of America.
The President and I are united in saying that the economic ties between our two countries do not correspond to the potential of our two countries. The Government of the Russian Federation, businessmen of both countries, and the U.S. administration, of course, can do a lot more to support the effectiveness of our economic ties. And the President expressed that we need an additional impulse from our businessmen, that we will do everything possible to receive a very high-level business delegation of the United States to Russia, moreover, especially if it is headed by one of the senior officials of the U.S. administration.
Here there are a lot of very specific issues. We talked about energy resources; we talked about using the Caspian Basin. You know, very soon the new pipeline system is going to go into effect, which is going to be transporting energy resources from the Caspian region through novie russkies. And this is a joint project of two companies, Russian and American companies. I'm sure that this will not be the last such project.
I want to stress here that the issues that were discussed at Ljubljana are going to be the subject of our continuing dialog. And we really, in fact, did agree that we're going to talk in Genoa; we're going to talk in Shanghai at the APEC Conference. And I'm very grateful to the President of the United States for inviting me to the United States. I would do it with great pleasure, especially because he invited to have me over at his ranch. And I'm going to receive him in my own home, not just in Russia but in my own home.
And the last, in the last few months, and at the very threshold of our meeting, there was a lot of discussion about the fact that U.S.-Russian relations are overburdened by problems and issues that are somehow reaching a critical stage. I think the very nature and the result of our discussion today between myself and the President of the United States will put an end to all of these rumors. We see very clearly a very positive prospect of our relationship in the future. And we are all geared up to work in the future constructively, pragmatically, and to establish very good, predictable relationship.
And of course, I cannot but say the very highest about the hospitality of our hosts, who provided us with all the conditions necessary for holding this very good meeting—good, moral atmosphere.
Thank you. Thank you ever so much.
Moderator. Dear colleagues, we have said that we're going to give the first opportunity to ask a question to journalists from Slovenia, please.
[At this point, a question was asked, and an English translation was not provided.]
President Bush. I don't think the interpreter could have done it in English, but anyway, go ahead.
NATO Enlargement
Q. On the next summit in Prague, where, according to Lord Robertson, enlargement will happen, and what is the Russian position on enlargement?
President Bush. I went to my first NATO summit, and there appears to be a uniform desire to expand NATO. This is certainly the position of my country. But as I reminded the leaders today, that there is a process, and the countries must work toward that process. I am impressed by the progress being made in this country, and we will take that under consideration when we meet in Prague a year from this fall.
The Balkans
Q. A question for you, Mr. Putin. You're leaving from Slovenia, straight to Belgrade. Do you have any concrete solutions for the Balkan crisis?
President Putin. As I understand you, what you have in mind is the situation in the region.
Yes, it's working. It's working. It's good to have dealings with effective people that make things work.
As I understand it, what you have in mind is the overall situation in the Balkans, right? Macedonia, Kosovo, et cetera, right? Well, we do have our own idea, vision of what's happening here and how we should act.
Today we did discuss with the President of the United States, Mr. Bush. The most important things that we have to really pay attention to is to put an effective block, an end to any kind of extremism and feelings of intolerance—religious intolerance. People who are trying to solve, no matter how complex an issue of national or ethnic or religious conflict—weapons simply are not those kinds of things which can solve these problems.
In some of the countries of the former Soviet Union, for instance—you probably know, we talk about this very often—in the Baltic States, for instance, we feel that human rights are damaged, especially of the ethnic Russian populations. In Latvia, for instance, 40 percent of the population is Russian-speaking, a huge number of noncitizens—in other words, people who can't even get citizenship. We don't send weapons there. We don't support those people. We don't call it terrorism. We don't try to get people to rise up on the basis of national or ethnic origin or religious feelings. We don't encourage people to take up arms to fight against that.
I stress against, and I insist that people who try to do this do not deserve the support of the international community. But on the contrary, the international community must say once and for all, everybody who does this will receive due answer. These things can only be solved through negotiations. This is a very difficult process. It requires patience, but there is no other way.
National Missile Defense/Nuclear Proliferation
Q. A question to both of you, if I may. President Putin, President Bush has said that he's going to go forward with his missile defense plans basically with or without your blessing. Are you unyielding in your opposition to his missile defense plan? Is there anything you can do to stop it?
And to President Bush, did President Putin ease your concern at all about the spread of nuclear technologies by Russia, and is this a man that Americans can trust?
President Bush. Yes. Do you want to go first?
President Putin. Now, as far as the issue of antimissile defense, the official position of the Russian Government is known. I don't think we need to spend time to, yet again, declare it. We proceed from the idea that the 1972 ABM Treaty is the cornerstone of the modern architecture of international security. We proceed from the premise that there are elements which unite us with our partners in the United States.
When we hear about things like concerns of the future and about threats from the future, we do agree that together, we have to sit down and have a good think about this. But we proceed from the idea that these concerns and threats are different kinds of things. Threats have to be defined. We have to look at where they come from and then make some decisions as to how we have to counter them.
We feel that we can do it best together. Based upon today's dialog, I've come to the conclusion, and the impression, that we might have a very constructive development here in this arena; at least the President of the United States listened carefully. He listens to our arguments very carefully. But I think the specialists, as I have said before, have to sit down, have contact to identify the overall platform that we're going to work from, and try to find a way together to solve these problems.
Now, as far as the issues of proliferation and nonproliferation, I have to say that in our opinion, this is a topic that's very, very closely tied to the ABM Treaty because many other things are hooked onto this same string. And many threshold states, when it comes to the destruction of a previous accord, can only be happy and say, ""Look, fantastic. Yesterday, we were threshold. Nobody agreed—nobody took any account of us—now, today, recognize us."" This is a problem we're going to have to really think very hard about.
Can we trust Russia? I'm not going to answer to that. I could ask the very same question.
President Bush. I found him to be very straightforward and trustworthy. We had a very good dialog. I was able to get a sense of his soul, a man deeply committed to his country and the best interests of his country. And I appreciated so very much the frank dialog. There was no kind of diplomatic chitchat, trying to throw each other off balance. There was a straightforward dialog. And that's the beginning of a very constructive relationship. I wouldn't have invited him to my ranch if I didn't trust him. [Laughter]
Secondly, I appreciate the opportunity to be able to talk about a new relationship, and we will continue these dialogs. The basis for my discussion began with this simple premise, that Russia and the United States must establish a new relationship beyond that of the old cold war mentality. The cold war said loud and clear that we're opponents and that we bring the peace through the ability for each of us to destroy each other. Friends don't destroy each other. People who cooperate do not have a basis of peace on destruction.
Our nations are confronted with new threats in the 21st century. Terror in the hands of what we call rogue nations is a threat. I expressed my concern—and so did the President—very openly, about nations on his border and nations that can't stand America's freedoms developing the capacity to hold each of us hostage; and he agreed. I brought up concerns about Iran. And I'm hesitant to put words in the President's mouth, but he said he's concerned, as well—I think that accurately categorizes your position—and we'll work together to stop the spread of weapons of mass destruction. And I believe as we go down the road that we'll be able to develop a constructive relationship as to how to use our technologies and research and willingness to keep the peace, in a way that makes the world more peaceful.
I was so pleased that we were able to begin constructive, real dialog between our Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld and Mr. Andrei Ivanov. These will be fruitful discussions, and I believe what people will see is a strategy, a joint strategy. The President's a history major, and so am I. And we remember the old history. It's time to write new history, in a positive and constructive way.
NATO Expansion
Q. This is a question to both Presidents, if you allow. Mr. Bush, you partially answered—you talked about issues of strategic security; you talked about the future. In this connection, could you tell us anything about what you talked about the expansion of NATO? Thank you.
President Bush. [Inaudible]—to expand, so long as nations met their obligations and fulfilled their—met what's called the MAP process. I said yesterday in Poland, I felt like a secure border for Russia, a border with safe and friendly nations, is positive. And I expressed my Government's position very plainly. And the President, of course, had a reaction, which I'm sure he'll give you right now.
I thought he was going to give it to you right now. [Laughter]
President Putin. Yes, I'm going to lay it out for you. I'm going to lay it out for you. Look, I'm going to read to you something which was recently declassified. Speaking for myself—look, this was printed a while back, but there's a document—attached addendum documents which were secret. ""Copy declassified""—it was top secret. Look, here it is. This is a note of the Soviet Government from 1954, sent to the countries of NATO. Here's what it says: ""The leadership, holding to its inalienable policy and taking into account all the tensions, the Soviet Government announces its intention to enter into discussions with NATO countries about its participation in NATO, with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.""
And this was the answer—look, here's the answer: The Soviet Government proposed—they were talking about the widening of the NATO pact and what they're going to do about bringing the Soviet Union in. ""There is no need to stress the completely unrealistic nature of such a proposal from the Soviet Union."" That's the answer that NATO gave.
So what we're talking about here, you remember about a year ago, I think, somebody asked a question about, ""What's your attitude? Is it possible that Russia is going to join in NATO or not?"" I said, ""Why not?"" And right away, Mrs. Albright, former Secretary of State—she was someplace on a trip to Europe—she said, ""Look, we're not talking about this right now.""
Look, you understand that our attitude toward NATO is not was one toward an enemy organization; of course not. And I'm very grateful to the President of the United States that finally, from the territory of the United States, these words were heard. This is very important for us; we value this. When a President of a great power says that he wants to see Russia as a partner and maybe even as an ally, this is worth so much to us.
But if that's the case, then, look, we ask ourselves a question: Look, this is a military organization? Yes, it's military. They don't want us there? They don't want us there. It's moving towards our border? Yes, it's moving towards our border. Why?
So this is the foundation of all our concerns, not just to bring it in or not bring it in, or accept NATO or not accept NATO. Look, the positive feeling that we now have developed today with President Bush—this could be a separate subject of discussion because, you know, Russia is cooperating with NATO. We have an agreement; we have association; we have various accords and treaties; there's the JPC. And there's no need to fire up this whole situation.
National Missile Defense/Russia-U.S. Relations
Q. Mr. President, did you offer President Putin any inducements in this conversation to ease his opposition to a U.S. missile defense plan?
And President Putin, to follow up on your comments just now, does the simple fact of President Bush saying that Russia is not an enemy actually change your strategic or military planning?
President Bush. I offered something: logic and a hopeful tomorrow. I offered the opportunity, which the President is going to seize, for us, as leaders of great powers, to work together.
We have a unique opportunity to address the true threats of the 21st century together. We have a great moment during our tenures to cast aside the suspicions and doubts that used to plague our nations. And I'm committed to do so.
I said in Poland, and I'll say it again: Russia is not the enemy of the United States. As a matter of fact, after our meeting today, I'm convinced it can be a strong partner and friend, more so than people could imagine.
The leader of Russia is working hard on behalf of his people to promote prosperity and peace. And I believe our nations can work together to achieve prosperity and peace, not only within our respective countries but around the world. I believe that.
And so we didn't have a bargaining session. We had a session of two men who have come to office for the right purpose, not only to represent our countries but given our standing, our respective standings, to work together to deal with the threats of the 21st century. A threat of the 21st century is energy; a threat of the 21st century is poverty; a threat of the 21st century is the spread of weapons of mass destruction. And as the President said to me clearly, he said that ""You're not the only nation that cares about weapons of mass destruction; we care."" And we have an opportunity to do that. We have an opportunity to reject extremists that could threaten our respective nations and respect our— and threaten our alliances. And we will do so—we will do so.
And today has been a very constructive day. Everybody is trying to read body language. Mark me down as very pleased with the progress and the frank discussion. We will meet again in July, then later in the fall. Then we'll have the great Crawford, Texas, summit. And I believe that people who watch carefully our relationship will see that it grows and emerges. It starts with trust. Ron [Ron Fournier, Associated Press] asked a great question: Can I trust him? And I can. And from that basis we can begin a very fruitful relationship.
Q. So there were no specific—that you offered in this meeting, just logic?
President Bush. We did not—well, first of all, our relationship is larger than just security relationships. It's bigger than figuring out how to deal with the ABM Treaty; it's much bigger than that. It deals with two leaders who share values.
The President told me something very interesting. He said, ""I read where you named your daughters after your mother and your mother-in-law."" And I said, ""Yes, I'm a great diplomat, aren't I?"" [Laughter] And he said, ""I did the same thing."" [Laughter] I said, ""Mr. President, you're a fine diplomat, as well."" We share our love for our families. We've got common interests. And from that basis we will seize the moment to make a difference in the world. That's why he ran for the Presidency, and it's why I ran for the Presidency.
This is not a bargaining session. The President didn't say, ""You know, if you do this, I'll do that."" It's bigger than that. It's a bigger relationship than that, and it's important to understand that.
Q. Question on whether the simple fact of President Bush saying that you are no longer—the United States is not your enemy actually changes your military thinking or your strategic thinking and planning?
President Putin. This is not a question; I think this has become an interview. [Laughter] But look, nonetheless, I'll respond. It's not by accident that I said that's it's important for us. And it seems to me that if you start with a mutual understanding that we are partners, that's the way we're going to move to try to solve this very important issue.
Look, we didn't just sit down and say that our specialists are going to meet and they're going to have an exchange of views. But we agreed that they're going to discuss very specific questions which cause concern to both sides, very specific items. I'm not prepared right now to get into this publicly, but we're talking about specifics.
Moreover, I have to say that between Russia and the United States, we have two protocols that we've signed on nonstrategic ABM systems, in New York and I think it was in Helsinki. And this, too, is a subject of very special review. I think the specialists should define all these things. Again, I define—I repeat—define the threats and those things which just stand in the way; to look at the power that both countries have to neutralize these threats. I think we can work out a common approach.
Russia-U.S. Economic Ties
Q. To both Presidents, if you allow: Getting back to trade and economic issues, ties between our two countries, how soon do you think we can expect a delegation of American businessmen to Moscow? And do you have any plans on creating an intergovernmental commission of various agencies, which could stimulate economic ties between the United States and Russia? Thank you.
President Bush. I'll talk to the Secretary of Commerce as soon as I get back and tell him of our agreement and get him moving. Sometimes I worry a little bit about commissions. If commissions exist just to exist, then I don't think it's fruitful. If commissions exist in order to stimulate action, then perhaps.
Let me say one other area where the United States is in agreement with Russia. We think Russia ought to be admitted into the World Trade Organization. And we'll work toward that end. The Russian President has expressed a desire to join the WTO, and I think it makes sense. I think that will help a lot.
And there's a lot of areas in our business relationships. I reminded the President that oftentimes people speak in terms of—they say Russia is a country of great resources, only referring to the energy resources, the mining resources, the timber resources. That's true. But Russia has got a resource that's invaluable in this new era, and that's brainpower. Russia's got great mathematicians and engineers who can just as easily participate in the high-tech world as American engineers and American mathematicians. And that's an area of great interest to me, and it's an area of great interest to the President. It's an area where we can begin a fruitful dialog.
The deployment of capital is something that's very important to Russia; it's important to our businessmen. The President understands it's important to have rule of law, a reasonable tax system, transparency in the economy. And he's working toward that, and I am grateful. Our businessmen and our Secretary of Commerce will hear that when they travel to Russia.
President Putin. You know, I agree with the President in that to overload our relationship by a variety of bureaucratic structures and organizations, that's not always justified. The most important thing is to create favorable conditions for effective work by the business community. We know the plans of President Bush with respect to his taxation policy and with respect to other measures which he is planning, with respect to the economy of the United States.
From our part, we still have to do so much that would make Russia attractive for foreign investors—although among international investors, the Americans are in first place. Naturally, first and foremost, we have to take care of the issues of the energy problem in the world at large. American business is showing a great interest in this sphere.
But we also know that President Bush has plans in the atomic energy field. Here, too, we think we've got a couple of things we could talk about. We have a very fruitful area of cooperation we could work in. We have a number of various structures that are working very appropriately now in reprocessing uranium.
We've got pretty good cooperation in space now. It seems to me that to a significant extent, that which exists now, it is functioning very successfully now, the space station, the International Space Station and the participation of the United States and Russia.
We have so many other areas we'd like to work in. But when the businessmen come—that depends, of course, on the U.S. side—but we'll receive them at any time that's appropriate to them.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-president-vladimir-putin-russia-kranj
George W. Bush,"July 22, 2001","Press Briefing by Dr. Rice Discussing the Bilateral Meeting of President Bush and Russian President Putin in Genoa, Italy","En Route Cristoforo Colombo AirportGenoa, Italy
3:27 P.M. (L)
MR. FLEISCHER: Does anybody have any questions?
Q: Yes, when they talked about joining forces, to work together in regional conflicts, do you know which in particular they think they can, and what joint forces means?
DR. RICE: Well, they used as an example what they've been able to do with the French, in NK, in Nagorno-Karabakh. And it doesn't mean military forces, it means joining diplomatic efforts. I think that Colin Powell believes, for instance, that Igor Ivanov has been very helpful in the Middle East. And obviously we're cooperating in the Balkans, which is another area. So those are the areas that I think that they really meant, and those are the areas they discussed in most detail.
Q: How did the Russians help in the Middle East?
DR. RICE: There have been several meetings between Arafat and Putin, Arafat and Igor Ivanov. Powell very often, when he's arranging the diplomacy he will call Annan, he'll call Solana and he'll call Igor Ivanov. And the idea is to get everybody giving the same message to Arafat. There have also been a couple of meetings with Sharon with the Russians. And obviously there are connections there, given the large Russian population. So I think they've actually been quite helpful.
Q: What about these discussions that you're going to go on, to see - so you're going to go and set up discussions between Ministers of Defense and Foreign Ministers. And then do you have any sort of timetable on when you hope things start rolling or getting a decision on any kind of cuts?
DR. RICE: Well, I think the important thing is that the schedule of consultations, is how I would describe it, we would hope to have completed by the time that I leave Moscow. And I think you'll see that they'd be very regular, because they talked about an intensive schedule of consultations.
I don't think that either president has in mind a timetable at the other end, in other words, you have to do it by this date. But they clearly want to make this quite intensive, and want to get going very soon. So it's my job to go get that schedule put together.
Q: Are they closer now to settling - are they further down the road now than they were after the Slovenia meeting? Did they make any progress today that's measurable?
DR. RICE: Well, I think that I'd just point you to the line in the joint statement that they already have some tangible areas of agreement. I think that they are making some progress on what the elements of a new strategic framework might entail, including discussions of defensive systems, although there's not yet agreement as to what form that would take, given the constraints of the ABM Treaty. But also that offensive reductions are a part of it, the non-proliferation efforts are a part of it, that discussions on terrorism are a part of it. So I think that what they've really moved forward on is what are the elements of a new strategic framework, and I think also, a kind of openness to the fact that a new strategic framework is a good idea.
Q: Where are they on the terrorism part of the talks?
DR. RICE: At this point, the discussion is to have under probably Deputy Secretary Armitage some discussions on terrorism -- on efforts to combat terrorism. The President always makes the point that in fact missile defense is one part of a counter-terrorism strategy, because you would be denying to countries that might try to use ballistic missiles in a terroristic way the capability to do that. But I think these will be pretty broad discussions. Right now it's just a commitment in principle.
Q: President Putin seemed very excited about the idea of linking offensive weapons to defensive weapons. Did the President bring that up first? What's your sense of that agreement? How does that work, because people may remember Reykjavik, where SDI was tied to - what's your sense of that?
DR. RICE: No, I think that there's something quite different in mind here, and in fact it was the President who first linked these, all the way back in his pre-election speech, but then at the Fort McNair speech he made very careful - very clear that he thinks these are all part of a package of elements of a new strategic framework. So again, I thought there was movement forward in hearing the Russian President say, all right, this has to be about defense and offense, not just as they tended to want to talk about offenses in the past.
Q: Going into this meeting, though, was it sort of reiterated, and said - that he brought up in this meeting, or was it something that you were - that Putin brought to this?
DR. RICE: They had been talking, and it was actually Putin who said that he thought it would be good to say that they were about to discuss this, and they decided then on a joint statement.
Q: Who was it that decided today? You guys hadn't already thought we'll have a statement?
DR. RICE: No, this came out in the meeting.
Q: Dr. Rice, after the first bilateral, in Slovenia, President Bush said that he looked into Mr. Putin's eyes and saw that he could trust him. And later on, he annotated that a little bit to say trust and verify. If you trust someone, why would you need to verify?
DR. RICE: Well, I don't think he - I think what the President said was, he - first of all, he is somebody that takes people at face value unless they give him reason not to. And he said that he thought that there was a basis here for a candid and honest and straightforward relationship. And I think that the meeting today did nothing but reinforce that.
Because I want to emphasize that they don't sit there and sugarcoat for each other sensitive issues. The President brought up the problem of freedom of the press. He brought it up in the small meeting and also in the expanded meeting. They talked about their differences on Iraq. They talked about Iran. I think you're going to see here a maturing relationship.
And a maturing relationship is one in which you do not simply talk about what you agree about, and try to make the other side feel good, but it's really a relationship in which you can, in a friendly way, still talk about difficult things. And I think that's what the President was expressing at Ljubjana, and I think that that was certainly the character of the meeting today, as well.
Q: Did they talk about the smart sanctions vote in the U.N.? And did President Putin give any expanded reasoning for why he thwarted us there?
DR. RICE: Well, the President did raise his disappointment that we were unable to come to agreement on Iraq, and that Russia was in fact the isolated party here. And President Putin said that he shared the goal of trying to make sure that Saddam Hussein would not be a threat to his neighbors or to his people again, but that they disagreed with the methodology here. The President listened to him. They agreed that the two foreign ministers would go back and hash it out.
But I think the President is very clear that he believes the United States and Britain have the right approach here. And it's going to be a matter of continuing to talk to the Russians about it. But there was no acrimony about it. But the President was very clear that he was disappointed that we were unable to get to an agreement on Iraq.
Q: When you talked about going to Russia yourself, and setting up this timetable and the schedule of intensive consultations, are you talking just logistically setting dates, or also setting agendas, and what does that step-by-step unfolding look like, even just topic wise?
DR. RICE: Well, I'm also going, in addition to setting up dates and logistics, as you say, to listen to the Russians on what they have in mind for these consultations, so that we have a sense of how they see the agenda unfolding. I don't think that we're going to say on August 1 we have to discuss X, and on August 7 we have to discuss Y. I don't think it will be like that. But I do think that we want to get a good sense of the topics and subject matter that both sides want to put on the table as we go forward.
And I want to emphasize that these are ministerial level consultations. This is not a set of 15 year arms control agreements -- arms control discussions. This is at the ministerial level, and we expect to move quickly.
Q: When do you actually leave?
DR. RICE: I leave from Rome, the day after tomorrow. I'm sorry, from Kosovo, the day after tomorrow.
Q: Will the schedule you set be consistent with the very loose time table you and Powell and others have set out, in terms of dealing with the issues relating to the ABM Treaty and missile testing of months, not years, in that short period of time? Are you talking about setting an aggressive schedule that would allow you to get to the brunt of those issues in the next few months?
DR. RICE: It clearly will be an aggressive schedule. And I think both Presidents want it to be an aggressive schedule, allowing for the fact that these are busy people, these ministers. And so one has to allow for that. But they clearly want an aggressive schedule. We don't have a specific timetable in mind. We've made very clear that the constraints of the treaty are a problem for us, and that the President really believes that he's going to need to move forward at an appropriate time. But I think right now what we're focused on is getting in motion high-level consultations, to see how quickly we might be able to sketch out an agreement.
Q: Back on the subject of linkage, what's your feeling, is it that there would be a linkage of nuclear arms reduction to just breaking the treaty, or that the arms reduction in nuclear forces would be a part in deploying an actual system?
DR. RICE: I wouldn't call it linkage. I think the better term is the one that's in the statement, which is that they're inter-related. And the reason that they're inter-related is that it's not that the offensive systems need to be maintained at a certain level to overwhelm the defensive systems, which was the thinking back in the Cold War days. Because the President has made very clear that this is a limited defense system, against several nuclear weapons, not against hundreds of nuclear weapons.
The way that they're related is that they are both elements of a new way of security, which is lower levels of offensive forces on lower stages of alert, so that there's less danger of accident, or unauthorized release, missile defenses aimed at specific limited threats, and that we get out of a force structure that really came out of a time when we worried about a Soviet march across Europe that would lead then to nuclear war. So it's in that sense that they're linked, not that the defensive systems require a certain number of offensive systems.
Q: Or that a reduction in the offensive systems is a precursor for Russian agreement?
DR. RICE: Right, we see it as all part of the same package. And I think that the good thing about today's statement was that there is no sequencing here. This seemed to be a package.
Q: You know, President Putin yesterday indicated he wanted specific information and details on what the problems were with the ABM, and what you wanted to change. Did you go into much more detail today?
DR. RICE: The President explained to him, as he said in the past, that the problem with the ABM Treaty is that it was signed to prevent you from building ballistic missile defenses. I mean, whenever you have a treaty that in every other line says, if you test in an ABM mode, you're in violation of the treaty, you have a problem with the treaty when you start trying to build ballistic missile defenses.
We consistently said that we don't think the way to approach this is to line in, line out the treaty, where we say this test requires that change in the treaty, because the treaty is so restrictive. And our view is that we need to move beyond it. We need to get flexibility for a robust testing and evaluation system. A robust testing and evaluation program is going to run afoul of this treaty. There's just no doubt about that, because just to give you an example, everybody's favorite potential system is a sea-based system of some kind, because of its flexibility. And in fact it would clearly not threaten the Russian deterrent. You can't test a sea-based system in an ABM mode. There are just too many limitations.
So I think the President, certainly when Don Rumsfeld and Sergei Ivanov get together, I'm sure Don can show him where this test or that test is a problem. But the fact of the matter is, the ABM Treaty was intended to prevent the development and deployment of ballistic missile defenses. And we have to always keep that in mind.
Let me just say one other thing. You can get five lawyers to give you different interpretations of when you're violating this treaty. And I'm a veteran of the sozdavat' (phonetic) controversy. Did the Russian verb sozdavat' (phonetic) mean to develop, or did it mean to establish? We don't want to get into that. We really want to get to a place where we have flexibility to do the testing and evaluation we need to do.
Q: Just on that, is it fair to say then that Putin essentially was trying to see how to amend the ABM, and you're saying let's start something new all together?
DR. RICE: I think we've always said that we believe that the ABM Treaty is not only a problem for the limitations it places on testing and evaluation, but it's the wrong treaty for the wrong era. And it inculcates and hardens a hostile relationship that no longer exists. But we'll talk to the Russians as to form. I think that's part of the consultation that needs to go on.
Q: From where Putin is coming from, is he looking much more at amending?
DR. RICE: I don't want to put words in his mouth. He has not, to my knowledge, yet said what he has in mind. So we need to talk to him about it.
Q: How much of their talks today were focused on defense, ABM, things like that, and how much were on other issues?
DR. RICE: I'd say it was about half and half.
Q: And what was the biggest other issue?
DR. RICE: They talked a lot about economic issues and economic cooperation. They talked some, within that context, about the kind of political environment that produces economic benefit, including the ability of citizens to express themselves, and so forth. So there was some talk about the Russian internal transformation.
Q: So they did bring up Chechnya and bring up human rights - I mean, the rights of free press, and things like that?
DR. RICE: They did bring up -
Q: Dr. Rice, unless I misunderstood your briefing back at the White House a week or two ago, you said that you weren't interested in getting into another treaty that would put restrictions on defensive weapons. Is that still the view of the United States, that you're not interested in another treaty that would restrict defensive weapons? And if that's the case, then in what way are defensive weapons part of these talks? Simply as a carrot to be offered to the Russians, so that they would agree to an offensive - in an offensive framework or -
DR. RICE: I'm sorry, the other way around. Right. No, the - what we're not interested in doing is replicating the old arms control process, by which it takes us 15 years to come to some agreement. We believe that that is something that happens when you have an implacably hostile relationship. And so we don't believe there's a need for such.
As I've said, we will talk to the Russians about what forms they have in mind. But I would expect, or certainly it's our view that these are more like defense planning talks, that you look at what is required for each side to insure itself. And when you look at - we understand that the Russians may not even see exactly the same threats that we see, because they have a different history and a different geography. That's okay.
Q: Was there any progress at all - does the President feel there was any progress at all, or on the U.S. side, on the calls for economic reforms in Russia? I mean, you mentioned press freedom economic reforms was one of the other big-ticket items?
DR. RICE: I think that you'll find that they're going to try to engage this dialogue on press in a creative way, for instance. At one point, there was some talk about what is the economic basis of a free press. This is an interesting question, because Russia doesn't actually have an advertising culture for the press. And so do you want them to have state ownership of the press, or is it going to be corporate ownership of the press? Or how do you think about supporting a free press? I think that's a dialogue they're interested in having.
On the economic progress that they're making, nobody would disagree - nobody could say they don't have a long way to go still, but they're making some progress. There's a lot of legislation before the Duma. The flat-tax got passed, and I think everybody believes the tax system was one of the biggest problems that they faced. Implementation I think is going to be difficult, but I think it's impressive what they've done so far in that regard.
Thanks.

George W. Bush,"September 25, 2001",Press Briefing by Ari Fleischer,"The James S. Brady Briefing Room
12:50 P.M. EDT
MR. FLEISCHER: Good afternoon. Let me give you an update on the President's day-to-day, and then share some other information with you.
 The President, as many of you know, began his day with a meeting of the bipartisan congressional leadership. He met with Majority Leader Daschle, Speaker Hastert, Minority Leader Lott, Minority Leader Gephardt, to discuss the military planning, as well as to discuss domestic consequences.
 He had his intelligence briefing and a briefing with the FBI this morning, and then he convened a meeting of the National Security Council. He has just concluded a meeting with the Prime Minister of Japan, where they discussed ways the United States and Japan will cooperate in fighting against terrorism, and he will depart shortly for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, where he will thank the workers there for the role that they have been playing in the war on terrorism. And he will also receive a briefing on several aspects of the investigation.
 The President will also travel to Chicago on Thursday to meet with airline workers at O'Hare Airport. He will thank the workers for their contributions in combatting terrorism by working every day and getting our airline system and our economy back on track to help keep our economy moving and to help to keep the American public moving.
 The President will also talk about the importance of the government and the airlines working together to address important issues of airline and airport safety. He'll address airline workers' concerns about these difficult times and the impact it's having on airline workers and their families.
 Following his meeting with the airline workers, the President will also have lunch with Mayor Daley. That's on Thursday.
 I want to share with you some new information, also, out of the Department of Education about assistance, and the Department of Treasury. From Education, Secretary Paige announced today that the U.S. Department of Education will provide $5 million in immediate assistance from his Rehabilitative Services Administration to New York State to help those who have suffered disabling and mental and physical injuries as a result of the terrorist attacks.
 The Secretary also announced a $1.7-million grant to New York from the Department's Project Serve to meet the needs of New York's school districts whose students and teachers were directly affected by the attacks. That grant is in addition to the $4-million grant that had previously been announced.
 And the Secretary announced that the Department is sending a team of mental health experts specializing in trauma and disaster response to meet with key staff of the New York City Board of Education to create a plan to help the city's students and teachers in the aftermath of the attacks.
 And now, over to Treasury. These are follow-on announcements to yesterday's announcement by the President in the Rose Garden. Secretary O'Neill participated today in a conference call with G7 finance ministers during which they discussed the economic and financial situation in the G7 countries and their common cause in strengthening the international fight against the financing of terrorism.
 And the Secretary and the finance ministers have issued a joint statement just moments ago in which they agreed to integrate action plans developed since the attacks, and pursue a comprehensive strategy to disrupt terrorist funding around the world. They also agreed to meet in the United States in early October to review the economic developments, which is a very encouraging sign that, again, the world is joining the United States, shoulder to shoulder, to fight this war against terrorism on multiple fronts, including the financial one.
 With that, I'm more than happy to take questions. Campbell.
 Q:Ari, the President said this morning that we're ""not into nation-building,"" but at the same time he's made it abundantly clear the Taliban is a target. So what is the administration's plan with regard to the power vacuum that's likely to result if we take out the Taliban?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, again, the President said that we have respect for the Afghani people. I remind you that the Taliban regime is not comprised entirely -- it's comprised substantially of non-Afghanis who came into Afghanistan for the purpose of sponsoring terror and bringing it to the rest of the world. So the President's message is that we will take actions designed to protect the people of the United States and protect the people around the world from terrorism, and that we will take action, including military action, against those who harbor terrorists.
 It is not designed to replace one regime with another regime. Part of the process also will be being mindful of stability in the region throughout the process. But it is not nation-building, but that's not to say that the Taliban will be given a free pass because they can encourage terrorism, harbor terrorism, and then because we have to worry about issues involving instability, won't take action. The President has made clear we will.
 Q:But if he says we're not into nation-building, ultimately you're going to have a situation when this is over that you have to deal with. Or is it your view that it's someone else's problem, other countries in the region should deal with it? Or is there -- Northern Alliance --
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, I think you're presuming in your question that whatever action the United States takes, and the world takes, that the situation in Afghanistan will be worse. And that's not a presumption that I think you can make.
 Q:Maybe because of the deliberate ambiguity of the President's comments, but I took it another way, which is that he was saying today that the government, our government is not after the removal of the Taliban as a precondition of achieving its objectives, that in fact, he'd work with any of the citizens of Afghanistan, he said, who would be willing not to support terrorism. Does it represent a less aggressive posture toward the regime in Afghanistan than he articulated in his list of demands last Thursday?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I think you need to look at it exactly as the President described it, which is that anybody who harbors terrorism will be the target of our operations and the target of our actions. And within the Taliban, they have to decide what to do. And clearly, they are, at least from what we're hearing, making their choice that they will continue to harbor terrorists. But we will take whatever action is necessary, with an eye always on stability, to protect people from terrorism that is sponsored by the Taliban.
 Q:But if there are officials within the Taliban, dissident officials, in Kabul as opposed to Kandahar, for example, who are willing to meet our demands, that's okay? We aren't looking, as you point out, to replace one regime with another, we just want to --
 MR. FLEISCHER: The issue is not to what regime do you belong, but what actions have you taken in sponsoring or harboring terrorism. If you are sponsoring or harboring terrorism, you will be a target for American action and for world action.
 Q:Don't you think that the United States ought to have an answer at the end of the road? If they do come along with us, this will happen, and so forth. You were saying, we're assuming it will be worse. We're not assuming anything. We want to know where you're headed.
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, that's why I answered Campbell's question by saying that stability is always an objective.
 Q:And this is -- you know, during World War II many promises were made, Atlantic Charter and so forth, to people who would help us, allies and so forth, North Africa, that they would find freedom at the end of the road, and so forth. And we are offering nothing, publicly.
 MR. FLEISCHER: What we are not doing is turning a blind eye to anybody who would sponsor or harbor terrorism.
 Q:All we're offering is destruction.
 MR. FLEISCHER: We're offering protection.
 Q:Ari, can I just follow? Isn't it fair to say the President said that the Taliban is an -- I think he used the word incredibly repressive regime. Does he believe that the Afghanistan population would be better off without it?
 MR. FLEISCHER: You know, again, there's no question the Taliban is a repressive regime. Women have no rights. It's just by all definitions of the free world and other world a repressive regime. But again, the fundamental mission that the President is focused on is going after, through a variety of means, those people who sponsor or harbor terrorists. The stability of the region is also an important issue, which is going to, of course, be a part of all the planning that goes into what is done.
 But it will not stop the United States or any other nations from taking action against those who have carried out this attack on the United States.
 Q:Where is the carrot?
 Q:Isn't it fair, though, to say that there has to be discussions going on within the administration and with allies about possible steps, whether it be a UN protectorate or something set up in the case of removal of the Taliban? I mean, isn't it fair to say there has to be some discussion of that?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Again, you're assuming the objective here is to remove a regime. The objective here is to target those who have sponsored or have gone after or harbored the terrorists. And that will take a variety of forms.
 Q:Ari, if our support for the Northern Alliance is not to overthrow the Taliban, is it then to try to occupy more areas of Afghanistan and remove the effective amount of territory that bin Laden can operate in?
 MR. FLEISCHER: The United States is going to work with a variety of people, including Pakistan and, of course, as you know, Russia and others, involving putting the coalition together.
 Your question on the Northern Alliance specifically is --
 Q:If our support of the Northern Alliance is not to remove the Taliban from power, is it then to encourage the Northern Alliance and help them occupy more areas of Afghanistan to remove the effective areas that bin Laden can operate out of?
 MR. FLEISCHER: The United States welcomes the efforts of the Northern Alliance and anybody else to put an end to those who sponsor terrorism to fight those who sponsor terrorism.
 Q:But have we stated to the Alliance that we want their help in fighting terrorism, but don't go -- don't march on Kabul?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I'm not going to be more explicit than that. We're not, as you know, indicating exactly what actions we're asking of different people or nations around the world.
 Q:Ari, can I put aside the issue of what we or our allies might do, but was I wrong when I heard that the President say that the Afghan people have this repressive regime, many would like to be rid of it -- but was I wrong in hearing him really calling for the overthrow of the Taliban?
 MR. FLEISCHER: The President has made it clear, and Condoleezza Rice said on one of the Sunday shows that the people of Afghanistan would clearly be better off with a different regime. But the whole purpose of this exercise is that the Taliban should not be given an excuse because there could be other issues that follow after their support for terrorism is diminished or put an end to.
 There should be no question around the world that our actions are going to be aimed at protecting citizens around the world from the Taliban's actions to sponsor terrorism.
 Q:Even if our explicit goal is not regime change or nation-building, the President would be delighted if the Afghan people did that job for us?
 MR. FLEISCHER: The Afghani people are not synonymous with the Taliban. They are different. And the Taliban, to a significant degree has come in from the outside, from other nations, from different regions of the world, and they've taken advantage of the turmoil that has existed in Afghanistan and the lack of a powerful central government in Afghanistan to make Afghanistan the breeding ground for their international terrorism.
 So there is a difference between the Afghani people and the Taliban.
 Q:If I just heard the statement you said, we would support any elements within Afghanistan who are willing to put -- that anybody --
 MR. FLEISCHER: End terrorism in Afghanistan. We'll work with them.
 Q:Ari, President Putin last night, when he spoke on Russian TV, made it clear that the degree of Russian participation in the campaign against terrorism would depend on what he called greater understanding for what the Russians are trying to do in Chechnya. Is he going to get that greater understanding from the United States?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, the position of the United States is enshrined as an important principle in fighting for human rights everywhere around the world. And it will continue to be America's position. Russia, too, has terrorist threats that it is addressing. And the United States at all times will remind all nations around the world, as they deal with any threats, that human rights must always be a policy objective.
 Q:Could you state for the record what this government's current view is of the war in Chechnya?
 MR. FLEISCHER: The United States government's view about the war in Chechnya is one that we are reminding the Russians about the need to adhere to important human rights, to respect the various nationalist movements, and to do so in a way that is consistent with the UN charter and human rights.
 Q:So, Ari, are you saying that with Russia and other nations who might be offering money or assistance to us, you'll not give up on this desire to have human rights be at the top of the agenda? You won't let that kind of slide for a little while in order to get their support?
 MR. FLEISCHER: You know, I think if you take a look around the world, at all the actions that over time our American military and our nation has been called on, human rights has always been at the forefront of it. It's true in the manner in which the United States military conducts its operation and the manner in which any type of harm to civilians has always tried to be kept to the absolute, absolute minimum. And that message is an internal American message to all nations around the world.
 Q:On the economic front, you mentioned earlier today that the administration is looking at both industry-specific problems and the big picture. Is it possible that we'll see another bailout similar to what you've done for the airline industry, for some other industry?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Ron, I think it's too soon to say. The focus remains on having taken action to help the one industry that was principally adversely affected as a result of an order by the United States government to put all its planes on the ground, and therefore, deny itself the ability to carry out its business for a period of several days, the United States moved quickly to help the airline industry.
 No such immediate action was taken that had a direct impact on any other industry. The President is working with members of Congress very closely on any potential next package that would help the economy in general. There could be different elements of that package that bring different amounts of help to different people, depending on their circumstances. But that's under review right now and there's no specific indications that I can give you about what it will look like.
 Q:To ask about the Taliban here, at what point did the President's strategists or advisors differentiate between the Afghan people and the Taliban? And are you saying that the United States is content to let the Taliban fall in upon itself and not make any sort of value judgment about who will replace that leadership?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, the distinction has always been made, and the best example I can give you is the United States provides approximately $140 million a year in assistance, humanitarian assistance, to help feed the people of Afghanistan, while at the same time the United States has never recognized the Taliban regime as a legitimate government. So that's the existing policy and it's a wise one.
 So all the actions that the President and his staff have been undertaking since September 11th have kept that distinction in mind.
 Q:Ari, and the second part of that question?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Give it to me again.
 Q:Is the United States content to let the Taliban fall down upon itself to create pressure that will cause it to fall apart on its own, without making a value judgment about who replaces that leadership?
 MR. FLEISCHER: The United States has made it clear about the conditions for actions that must be taken on the ground in Afghanistan, involving turning over Osama bin Laden, his top lieutenants to the proper authorities, shutting down and closing all the terrorist facilities, allowing United States access to make certain that they're shut down. Those are the conditions and they need to be met.
 Q:On the Hill, Ari, you've had Greenspan and Rubin meeting yesterday on the House side, today on the Senate side, talking about economic stimulus. To what extent is the White House involved in this, and what does the White House view on the need for any stimulus in general, and on the efficacy of any particular actions that might be taken?
 MR. FLEISCHER: That's why I indicated the administration is working very closely with members of Congress about what type of economic action could be taken to help as far as a stimulus for the economy.
 One of the interesting developments out of some of these meetings on the Hill involving Chairman Greenspan was the Chairman's statement that it's very important for Congress to pass trade promotion authority. He believes that in the wake of the attack on the United States it's now more important than ever for the United States to have that authority. That's been reported by a senator up on the Hill this morning; it's the senator's attribution of what Mr. Greenspan said.
 And the President shares that view. The President does believe it's important for Congress to take action on trade promotion authority and do so this fall as another way to help the economic and to help protect, to create jobs in America.
 Q:Has the administration reached a view that it is necessary, in fact, to have another stimulus program, a package of things to stimulate the economy, beyond what is already in place?
 MR. FLEISCHER: It remains under review.
 Q:Ari, isn't the President concerned that an issue like that, if it comes up for a vote in the House, will be divisive and harm this unity that he's fostered on the Hill?
 MR. FLEISCHER: No, I think the President wants to do it in a way that reaches out. Clearly, trade promotion authority cannot be agreed to unless it is bipartisan. You have a Republican House and a Democratic Senate, so by definition, anything that moves in the Congress will move with bipartisan support.
 Q:A recent Bloomberg news poll shows that while a majority of Americans support war, they don't support using the Social Security Trust Fund to pay for it. What is the administration's position on this? Isn't it kind of clear that you would need to dip into this money?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Let me make a couple of points. One is, I read that story; it surely seemed to me, at least by the person who was quoted in the story, is that he was under the impression that the choice was lose his Social Security check or pay for a war, which clearly is not the case. The existence of the Social Security surplus has nothing to do with the ability of the government to pay all benefits to retirees now and for the long-term future. So I think there was a wording issue in that poll.
 But even having said that, the President is not going to be governed by whatever the polls show. And I think the President recognizes that -- he's appreciative of the very strong support he has from the American people. I don't think anybody believes a 90-percent rating is going to last forever. But the President is going to continue to do what he thinks is right for the country and protect the country and to take whatever actions are necessary in accordance with his previous statements about Social Security should not be used unless in times of war or recession. And clearly, we are in a time of war.
 Q:Is the President, when he meets with the airline workers on Thursday, going to have anything to offer beyond what he's already done for that industry, and the possibility that there might be additional stimulus?
 MR. FLEISCHER: We'll keep you posted if there are any policy developments to accompany that trip. Nothing I can report now.
 Q:But he's going to meet them. Is he simply going to feel their pain, or is he going to try and help them in some other way?
 MR. FLEISCHER: It's exactly what I indicated in my announcement of the trip. And if there are any other add-ons to it we'll let you know, we'll keep you posted.
 Q:Ari, do you know if the President has spoken directly with the exiled King of Afghanistan?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I have no information that says he has.
 Q:Ari, forgive me if this is answered by the Pentagon. In the letter the President sent yesterday about the deployment of combat-equipped troops to foreign nations in Central and Pacific Command, do we know what nations and what the criteria is, or are we not allowed to know?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I'll have to look into that. I don't know that specifically.
 Q:On airline security, the President said that Transportation Secretary Mineta, coming over this afternoon. So he's going to present options. Are we expecting the President to sign off on recommendations today?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, I think it depends on what the options are and what the discussion is. The President has asked his advisors to take a look at various issues affecting airline security and other matters like that. He's having a series of meetings; he'll likely have more. So I'll be in that meeting and if there's anything to report, I'll try to keep you posted.
 Q:As I understand, you know, Mineta has the task force. Is he presenting to the President the findings of the task force?  MR. FLEISCHER: Let the meeting take place, and I'll try to fill you in.
 Q:Can I just ask one other question? Sorry, John. In terms of one view of the President, does he support having federal workers, federal employees be the ones to screen baggage and luggage at airports?
 MR. FLEISCHER: That's under review. I think it's part of the whole package. The President wants to see the recommendations in their totality. John?
 Q:I was just going to ask that.
 MR. FLEISCHER: Okay.
 Q:The President this morning said that Labor Secretary Chao is developing recommendations to address displaced workers, but no consensus has been reached yet. Can you elaborate on what the differences are? Is this dealing with what sectors should be assisted, or how to assist displaced workers?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, of course here you get into the differences in the government about who has direct authority over which programs. Secretary of Labor, of course, has jurisdiction over unemployment programs. And clearly, there are concerns as tens of thousands of Americans have been laid off and are being laid off about what actions the government can take to make sure that the safety net is working for them. And so that's what he's referring to.
 Let me broaden this for a second, because a lot of the questions are on what are we going to do on aviation security, on the economy stimulus, on help for uninsured workers. And I just want to reiterate something I mentioned last week. Throughout this process, still, the normal, deliberative, thoughtful fashion of the government has got to go on. There is going to planning on the military front. There is of course a rush to action to help people in New York and at the Pentagon respond to the immediacies of the disasters.
 But when it comes to what domestic action needs to be taken, one of the strengths of our country, and one of the factors of a Congress is that it needs to be carefully thought through, developed, worked with the Congress, hearings held. And that in itself is a process that takes time. And the administration recognizes that. So that's one of the reasons you're hearing on a lot of these issues, it's under review, et cetera. There won't be a rush to action; there is going to be action taken at the appropriate time.
 Q:With respect to that, Secretary O'Neill has indicated that if there is to be any stimulus package, you need probably at least another week to asses the impact of September 11th. Would you agree with that time frame?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, I'm not going to comment on any particular timetable. But as I indicated, it's a process that will take an amount of time to make certain that's a deliberative and thoughtful process. I'm not going to put a hard day on it. It very well may turn out to be exactly that. It may turn out to be somewhat closer or different from that.
 Q:Just a follow-up on Keith's question. The President's not worried at all that wrapping up TPA into the economic stimulus package is going to kill any chance of getting a stimulus package through, if in --
 MR. FLEISCHER: One, I never said anything about wrapping it up into a stimulus package. I talked about it, as others have, on its own merit, and its own intrinsic worth. But no determination is made about whether that will be part of an existing stimulus or not. But no, that remains an important issue for many Democrats and Republicans, and something the President feels strongly about.
 Q:On the stimulus package, does the administration share the concern of some economists that there's a danger here of replicating policy mistakes of the late '60s, building in too much stimulus that would then have the effect of laying the groundwork for an inflation problem down the road?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, without addressing specifically that one concern, there are a variety of reasons that the thoughtful process that our framers left to us that has gotten this nation through times of war and times of peace is a process that needs to be followed. And that is why, as I indicate, it's going to be deliberative, it's going to be thoughtful. It won't be a rush to come out with an economic stimulus because the nation was attacked; it has to be done right.
 And that's why the President met with the leaders today, to discuss it with them, to talk it through with them, to listen and to hear their ideas to share his thoughts. And that's how the process will go. And then, of course, it's going to go through the regular order of the Congress, which is a process that takes weeks.
 Q:Is it possible to offer some indication of the extent to which, in the debate within the administration, the prospect or the problems of potential inflation in the future are being factored into this deliberative process?
 MR. FLEISCHER: In the meetings that I've been in, I have not heard that explicitly said. There are lots of economists in this building though, so I wouldn't rule out that some economist somewhere said something.
 Q:The administration has said war or recession justifies spending the Social Security surplus. But do they believe the same things justify going into deficit spending, or is there a bottom line on how much they would spend?
 MR. FLEISCHER: The President's priority is to take the necessary steps to protect this nation in the wake of this attack, and to assemble the coalition and give it the means required so that we can be victorious in this was throughout whatever period of time it's going to take.
 The budget implications of that remain to be precisely determined, and those will also substantially be driven by the strength of the economy and how quickly the economy comes back. So we'll all have at our disposal the latest estimates, as time goes by, about the shape of the economy.
 But make no mistake about the President's priority is to give the resources necessary to fight and win a war. He will always be mindful that whatever actions are taken still involve taxpayer dollars. And that's when it comes to the domestic consequences, when it comes to any industries that are asking for assistance, or whether it comes to the means necessary to fight the war.
 Q:But you would not rule out deficit spending, if that's what it takes to fight the war?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, right now the government continues to have a very large surplus. I think the other day I explained that this was the first time in the nation's history that the government has had a surplus as it began a major military effort like this. Previously, it's always had deficits, which puts the country, economically speaking, in a stronger position to begin this effort. But those are the President's priorities.
 Q:On coalition-building, can you -- the significance of the Saudi move, cutting off from the Taliban?
 MR. FLEISCHER: That's a very significant step for the Saudi government to take. And the President, as he indicated, is appreciate of the actions that they have taken in this regard.
 Q:Ari, are you confident you can pass trade promotion authority this fall, and avoid a difficult fight --
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, I think you have to let it develop on the Hill. And to continue -- the President will continue to work it in a bipartisan fashion. He'll continue to listen and to have outreach. Clearly, even in this wonderfully new mood of cooperation that has taken place on the Hill, nobody expects votes to be 535-0. But we still have a system, and it's a system that has worked well throughout times of war and times of peace. And the President is going to continue to do everything he can to work cooperatively with as many people as possible. Hence this morning's meetings with the Democrats and the Republicans.
 Q:This morning, Representative Gephardt said that on the education bill, he needed to talk to more of his members, this was going to take more time, that there was a lot more work to be done. Is the administration disappointed in that? Does the President want to get this done? Is this an indication, even quietly, of the return of some of the partisan differences over that issue in particular?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I don't think it's a return to partisan differences, Terry. I think it's the right of members of Congress to weigh in. And there are 535 people who have a right to weigh in. And there are going to be a variety of viewpoints expressed. The important thing is to keep the sense of comity and working together strong. And that's why the President met this morning with the Speaker, the Minority Leader, the Majority Leader. And he'll continue to do that.
 Will there be voices from the Hill that disagree with the administration on issues? Of course. But, together, a lot can still be accomplished on the issues like education, on patients' bill of rights, on trade promotion authority, on an energy package. Senator Lieberman has indicated interest in continuing to move the faith-based package. So there continues to be signs of good progress on the Hill.
 Q:Even on education? It doesn't look like that's going anywhere for the moment.
 MR. FLEISCHER: No, I think clearly it's going. It's heading into the Conference Committee. Nobody expected it to be passed today. We have to wrap this in just a minute, because we've got to all get to the FBI.
 Q:Ari, are there plans to have meetings like the one with the congressional leaders once a week, like a regular meeting with congressional leadership every week?
 MR. FLEISCHER: It's not a regularly scheduled once a week, but it just seems to be working out that way, at least at this point. And a lot of phone conversations as well.
 THE PRESS: Thank you.
 MR. FLEISCHER: Thank you.

George W. Bush,"September 26, 2001",Press Briefing by Ari Fleischer,"12:38 P.M. EDT
MR. FLEISCHER: Good afternoon. Let me update you on the President's day, and then I'll be more than happy to take any questions. The President this morning spoke with Dutch Prime Minister Kok. The President and the Prime Minister expressed their agreement about the need for full solidarity, and the Prime Minister said that the Dutch government would be with the people of the United States and stressed that solidarity means deeds, not just words.
 The President also this morning spoke with Kazakhstan President Nazarbayev. The two Presidents discussed cooperation in the common fight against terrorism. And President Nazarbayev reiterated that Kazakhstan will support the U.S.-led effort ""with all available means.""
 The President earlier this morning convened a meeting of his National Security Council. He concluded just recently a meeting -- it may still be going on, if it's not quite concluded -- with a group of American Sikhs, another reminder to the American people of the importance of waging a battle against intolerance and prejudice in this country as we proceed with this fight against terrorism. The American Sikh community has been beset with occasional violence and it's another reminder about the need for Americans to honor our constitutional principles in respecting all Americans and all visitors to our country throughout this time.
 The President will depart for the Central Intelligence Agency in the early afternoon, where he will have a briefing over at CIA, take a tour of the CIA, and thank the CIA employees for all the efforts that they are making to win the war against terrorism.
 Upon his return to the White House in the mid-afternoon, the President will meet with a group of Muslim leaders to send another signal, another reminder to the American people about the need to be -- to avoid prejudice and intolerance. The Muslim American community has been very supportive and cooperative with all efforts to win the war on terrorism, and the President is very appreciative of that.
 He will meet with the Foreign Minister of Egypt at 4:15 p.m. in the Oval Office. And at 4:50 p.m., the President will have a meeting of his Domestic Consequences Group to discuss economic actions that the government may be able to take to help provide a stimulus to the economy.
 A couple updates on other events or briefings: Secretary Powell will also meet with the Egyptian Foreign Minister at 2:30 p.m., and then the two will participate in a joint stakeout at the State Department at 3:00 p.m. In addition to the schedule from what I announced earlier, Attorney General Ashcroft and FBI Director Mueller will also hold a briefing for the American people at 3:15 p.m., open to the press, of course, to continue to communicate with the American people about the efforts underway in the war against terrorism.
 Q:Ari, Pakistan says they've been discussing with the U.S. a broad agreement on an operational plan that includes attacks on camps in Afghanistan. Is that report inaccurate?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Ron, I'm not going to characterize in any way any of the operational details about what the United States may or may not be discussing with any of our coalition friends.
 Q:Is the United States taking a softer line on Russia over Chechnya in return for the cooperation Putin has offered in this effort?
 MR. FLEISCHER: President Putin gave a very important speech the other day. This should be noted. President Bush appreciated very much President Putin's offer of concrete cooperation in the common fight against international terrorism. And President Putin's remarks demonstrate that Russia can make a major contribution to that common struggle against international terrorism, while at the same time displaying a respect for the sovereignty and independence of Russia's neighbors.
 In particular, the President noted and wants to thank President Putin for his offer to provide, as President Putin described it, permission for humanitarian overflights, information about the situation on the ground, as well as search and rescue operations, if necessary. The President looks forward to continuing to work with the Russia government together as we build this international coalition.
 But the President also wants to note particularly President Putin's remarks about the situation in Chechnya in which President Putin called on Chechen insurgents to disassociate themselves immediately from the international terrorist networks, and meet for discussions to resolve the crisis in Chechnya.
 The Chechnya leadership, like all responsible political leaders in the world, must immediately and unconditionally cut all contacts with international terrorist groups, such as Osama bin Laden and the al Qaeda organization. At the same time, the United States has long said that the only solution in Chechnya is a political solution, a political process to resolve the conflict there. The President welcomes the sincere steps that have been taken by Russia to engage the Chechen leadership and, consistent with what you've heard repeatedly, respect for human rights and accountability for violations on all sides is crucial to a durable peace there.
 Q:Does this offer by Putin reflect any input by the United States, did Bush suggest that you needed to do something on Chechnya? And do you have any idea what might happen if the 72-hour period expires without an acceptance by the rebels?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Actually, there's been an update on that. As you may have heard, Chechen leader, Mr. Maskhadov has responded, indicated a commitment to the peace process. He has indicated a willingness, and so it's important now to let events develop in Chechnya. That is an encouraging sign.
 Q:And so, the administration believes, with President Putin, that the resistance in Chechnya has been infiltrated and is linked to the same terrorist networks that committed the atrocities in New York?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Terry, there is no question that there is an international terrorist presence in Chechnya that has links to Osama bin Laden. And that's why I indicated what I indicated. That also is a point of view that was shared with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in, I believe, it was November of 1999 by a spokesman, an official from the Clinton State Department when he testified before Senate Foreign Relations. So that's been long been known; in fact, it's been referenced in the Pattern of Global Terrorism Report, which was issued by the State Department.
 Q:One more on this. Would, then, Chechen separatists, by the statement you ready today also calling on them to cut off links to this group -- are they on notice as the Taliban is that they will share the terrorists' fate if they don't do so?
 MR. FLEISCHER: No, the President's words speak for themselves about those terrorist organizations that have global reach. But what's notable here is, the President is reiterating that it's important to have a political solution to the situation in Chechnya. But, undeniably, there are terrorists' organizations in Chechnya that have ties to Osama bin Laden.
 Q:And did he suggest this offer by Putin? Did the President and Putin discuss this offer in advance of Putin's making it? Does this reflect U.S. input?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I'd have to check, Randy. Don't know.
 Q:Haven't we made many statements denouncing Russia for its attacks at Chechnya? And is there some image of some freedom fighters there? And all of a sudden, you're calling them terrorists?
 MR. FLEISCHER: As I just indicated, the concern for human rights remains a vital part of American policy, and the only solution to the problem in Chechnya is a political one.
 Q:Yes. But why is it just today that you're calling them terrorists? What has changed? Is this what Putin has asked for, in exchange for his help?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, as I indicated, that's not the case. That's been the longstanding position.
 Q:I think this is the first time -- is this not the first time you've used this word at that podium?
 Q:It's the first time we've heard it.
 MR. FLEISCHER: I'm not sure that I have discussed the situation in Chechnya with the White House Press Corps prior to this. We haven't had much reason to do so. But that's why I indicated, going back to the previous administration, in testimony before the Senate, they said what they said because it's true. And the State Department publishes a report every year that included similar information.
 Q:Is it fair to assume that these words from you are in exchange for Putin's cooperation on the U.S. effort?
 MR. FLEISCHER: No, it's an accurate statement about the situation on the ground and the importance of the speech that President Putin made. But keep in mind, President Putin called for political discussions, which leaders of Chechnya have now indicated they are willing to engage in such discussions. That's a positive development.
 Q:Sounds like a deal, though. It sounds like in exchange for Putin's support, we, rhetorically from this podium, are lending him support in characterizing the opposition as international terrorists.
 MR. FLEISCHER: No, no such conclusion should be reached. This is consistent with actions taken by the previous administration, because it's an accurate statement about developments in Chechnya.
 Q:Can you give us the date of that Senate testimony?
 MR. FLEISCHER: If I recall, it was November 1999.
 Q:Is the administration planning to go to the U.N. Security Council before for approval before any sort of military action is taken? And do you think that's something you should do? Is it necessary?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Number one, the United Nations through the Security Council has already spoken out on this matter. Number two --
 Q:But not on military action.
 MR. FLEISCHER: Number two, in accordance with the U.N. Charter, the United States has the right to self-defense, of course. The President has spoken directly on that point. But no decision has been reached about whether or not there will be any additional requests made of or through the United Nations. There's just no determination at this time.
 Q:But it's something under discussion that you're talking about?
 MR. FLEISCHER: It's one of many options that could be used, but there's no determination.
 Q:Senator Shelby continues to suggest that CIA Director Tenet should probably step down. Is the President planning today to indicate his support for the Director?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Director Tenet has the full faith and confidence of the President. The President will be at the CIA. He'll have public remarks, so you'll have to hear those yourself.
 Q:How does the White House, CIA and so forth view bin Laden? Is he a religious leader or a political leader, or both?
 MR. FLEISCHER: He's a terrorist. He's a leader of a terrorist organization that has inflicted grievous harm on our country. That is the only way to see him. The President has described him as an evildoer, and the President has said that this is a struggle between good and evil.
 Q:But deeper into that, do you consider him a religious leader or a political leader?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I think it's so hard to assign any religious value to the acts that he's carried out. There is no religion that preaches or tolerates the murder of innocent civilians, as he has done to our nation. There is only one word to describe him, and that is a terrorist.
 Q:I mean, terrorist is an all-encompassing word. What do you think his goals are? Political, are they not?
 MR. FLEISCHER: His goals are murderous, and that's how he's viewed.
 Q:Just to murder --
 Q:Actually, kind of following up on that, but maybe a little more personal, President Mubarak has basically said the President was a target in Genoa during the summit. A few weeks ago, you were concerned that Air Force One was a target of the attacks. Does the White House believe that bin Laden is trying to kill the President?
 MR. FLEISCHER: You know, I'm not going to comment on any particular threats coming toward the White House. Unfortunately, as you all who work here know, it is not an uncommon occurrence for people to threaten the government of the United States, regardless of whether it's President Bush or any of his predecessors. And that's why there are security precautions taken at the White House as a matter of routine.
 But that's not what this is about. This has nothing to do with anything individual that may or may not have been directed at President Bush; this is about an attack that took place on our country.
 Q:Ari, on your Chicago trip tomorrow, the President is going to announce some security measures for the airlines?
 MR. FLEISCHER: The President has been reviewing reactions that the government should appropriately take to help protect the traveling public through increased security at the nation's airports and on airplanes. The President has a visit to Chicago tomorrow where he will discuss a series of issues important to the traveling public and to the airline industry, and when the President has concluded his review, he will make the announcement himself.
 Q:Tomorrow?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I think that's a good possibility, Elizabeth.
 Q:Ari, is anything off the table, though, any of the options, such as guns in the cockpit or federal employees to be the airport screeners? Are those off the table?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I think at this point it's best to let the President express it for himself. He'll be doing that shortly.
 Q:So he's going potentially tomorrow, so is it fair to say he's pretty much decided, there's a decision-making agreement?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I think he's likely to have a couple of additional conversations today.
 Q:Ari, any reaction to the burning of buildings in the embassy grounds, U.S. embassy grounds in Kabul?
 MR. FLEISCHER: There's no immediate -- I mean, I think it's just another sign of the fact that this is serious. That was an abandoned building, as you know. The United States left it many, many years ago, but it doesn't change anything about what the President has said or what the mission of the United States will be.
 Q:Ari, on Pakistan, this is not an operational question, but the Foreign Minister is quoted as saying he's asked the administration to put aside any notion of supporting Afghan opposition groups. Is this a roll-back on Pakistan's part? What is your assessment of the level of cooperation the U.S. is getting from Pakistan?
 MR. FLEISCHER: It's been very good. And as I've indicated all week, there are going to be certain areas in which different nations cooperate in different ways. And I think you can anticipate that with Pakistan, as well as any number of nations.
 Q:Could I follow on that, though? Have the Pakistanis warned the administration about supporting the Northern Alliance in the overthrow of the Taliban? Have they expressed concern about the President's comments sort of encouraging the people of Afghanistan to step up -- of the Taliban regime?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, historically, there are certain facts about the relationship between the Northern Alliance and Pakistan that are indisputable. And as the United States goes about building the effort to put an end to the terrorist actions that are fostered in Afghanistan by Osama bin Laden, the al Qaeda organization, hosted by and harbored by the Taliban government, the United States will keep all these interrelationships in mind.
 Q:So Pakistan has legitimate interests inside Afghanistan which we will take into account?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I think it's a very complicated region of the world, Terry, where there's a host of groups and nations that have longstanding -- have various amounts of interests. And as I indicated, there is an historical relationship between the Northern Alliance and the Pakistan government, which the United States is aware of and sensitive to.
 Q:Ari, Iran has soundly rejected any overtures that the U.S. might or might not be making in terms of building an international coalition; in fact, calling the U.S. effort ""disgusting."" Any reaction?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, again, the President has made it clear that this is a time for nations to choose about whether they are with the United States and the free world in the war against terrorism or they are not. And I will leave it at that.
 Q:Ari, is the President going to have any concrete requests about how he wants Egypt to be involved in this war today?
 MR. FLEISCHER: He may. But, again, I'm not going to be at liberty to get into any specific requests that the United States is asking. But Egypt has been a good friend of the United States before, and the relationship remains very strong.
 Q:Ari, I know you don't want to comment on specific tax cuts that you're considering, or at least you didn't this morning. But would you comment on whether or not tax cuts that people are considering as part of the stimulus package potentially should be temporary, or should they again be looking at long-term tax cuts as were passed earlier?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I think from the President's point of view, it will all depend on the substance of the specific tax cut, for example. The tax cut that has been passed by the Congress and signed into law, the President obviously believes that should be permanent. The President believes that is helpful for the economy now and long-term, and plus it's the right thing to do. People should not have a marriage penalty reimposed on them for any reason, for example.
 Other ideas that are new will be considered, and there are some suggestions that some of those be temporary, and I think the President will weigh any reason for something to be temporary, as opposed to permanent, in the context of whatever that new idea may be.
 Q:Okay. And are reports correct that the White House has been specifically pushing for a cut in corporate taxes?
 MR. FLEISCHER: That's one of the options that's under review.
 Q:Have you been pushing for that on the Hill? Supporting that?
 MR. FLEISCHER: The White House isn't pushing for anything on the Hill because the President hasn't given any indications yet about any determinations or decisions that he has made. There have been a series of conversations with people on the Hill where the pros and cons of various proposals have been walked through, including a reduction in the corporate tax rate, but that falls under the category of a series of tax items that have been discussed with the Hill. But I think that's what you're hearing.
 Q:Ari, is there going to be any economic announcements tomorrow, therefore, in Chicago, along these lines of a stimulus?
MR. FLEISCHER: I would just wait until tomorrow. And you've asked me a question about airlines tomorrow, and I'm not going to go beyond that. The President may have something to say tomorrow on that topic.
 Q:-- just for the airlines --
 MR. FLEISCHER: The event tomorrow is more focused on the airlines. But at all times, the President is concerned about the economy. He'll have remarks tomorrow, and I'll just leave it at that.
 Q:Can I just follow on that --
 Q:Ari, when the Republican leadership says that Larry Lindsey is pushing for a corporate tax cut, they're mistaken?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Can you tell me who is saying that?
 Q:Dick Armey.
 MR. FLEISCHER: I'm not aware of any conversation like that. I know that -- I've talked to Dr. Lindsey about this and what he's indicated to me is he's had a series of conversations, just as I outlined, where he is talking about the pros and cons of a variety of proposals, including a reduction in the corporate rates.
 Q:But he's not pushing it, he's just saying, these are our options? He's not favoring one or the other?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I think Larry is well aware, as many of the advisors to the President are, that there are a series of pros and cons that come with these actions.
 Q:Ari, getting back to the issue of getting things back to normal, the President is going to be flying out to Chicago tomorrow. He had this meeting with the Boys and Girls Club this morning. When will the White House be back to full-speed, the typical activities before September 11th, with the public tours and things of that nature, especially since you said today is the first time for this Boys and Girls Club or any other group to come to meet with the President?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, let me answer that -- I mean, full-speed -- given the events of September 11th, it would be nice to slow down to full-speed. It's not a question of full-speed, it's just a question of there has been a necessary realignment of the President's time and schedule so he can focus more of his time, unfortunately, on war preparations. That is typical in any American presidency, or most American presidencies.
 But there are increasing signs that the other parts of the agenda are showing back up on the President's school and other people's schedules. And you cited a couple of those examples today -- the meeting with the Boys Club today, the travel to Chicago tomorrow. The President and his wife went out for dinner last night. I mean, I think these things also marry to some degree what the American people are doing. They're increasingly getting back on with their lives.
 Q:Where did they go to dinner last night? And I have a follow-up to that. Where did they go to dinner?
 MR. FLEISCHER: They went to a restaurant in Arlington. The press went with them. There's a pool report available on it; it was a publicly-announced trip. They went last night.
 Q:No wonder traffic was so bad on the way home. (Laughter.)
 Q:Ari, a follow-up to that, though. The situation, though --
 MR. FLEISCHER: No, there was a report on it last night. The press went with them. The press always goes with them.
 Q:The newspapers haven't seen a pool report on this.
 MR. FLEISCHER: I can tell you the pool went with them.
 Q:Okay, well, come back. As far as people coming back into the White House, this is, like you said earlier, this is a first since September 11th. Is the White House -- is the feeling here at the White House that the threat here has lessened for the American public to come back into this place, the people's house?
 MR. FLEISCHER: What I indicated this morning was, it's not a first for visitors to coming to the White House on September 11th. The White House has been entertaining visitors to the White House since September 11th on a regular basis. This was the first of where the more traditional -- they're called literally photo opportunities, but the more ceremonial part of a presidency, where the President will meet with various award winners across the United States to thank them and to honor them for, in this case, being the Boys Club Youth of the Year.
 The President's had a series of meetings like he's had today with the Muslim leaders, with the Sikh leaders. He's had earlier meetings with other groups throughout the period since September 11th. Those are private citizens coming to the White House for specific purposes. What took place today, though, was a return to the more ceremonial aspects of the job.
 Q:Will the public tours resume again soon?
 MR. FLEISCHER: We'll announce that whenever they do. There is no information on that at this time.
 Q:Ari, on the airlines, is there some sort of snag in getting the $5 billion in emergency funding to the airlines?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I think that OMB announced last night that that money was being released. There is a formula for its distribution, and that formula is set in law by the act of Congress which the President signed. So the money has been released as of yesterday. I'm now aware of any problems -- it was released yesterday.
 Q:Has the President had any communication with Representative Cooksey regarding his comments on Sikh Americans? And does he have a message for lawmakers and members of his party in particular about this issue?
 MR. FLEISCHER: The President's message is to all Americans. It's important for all Americans to remember the traditions of our country that make us so strong and so free, our tolerance and openness and acceptance. All Americans -- and we come from a very rich cultural heritage, no matter what anybody's background in this country. And that's the strength of this country, and that's the President's message that he expressed in his speech to Congress and as he has done when he visited the mosque a week ago Monday, and in the meetings that he's hosting here at the White House today with Muslim Americans and Sikh Americans.
 Q:Did he speak to Representative Cooksey, and what were his reactions upon hearing those?
 MR. FLEISCHER: The President was very disturbed by those remarks.
 Q:Ari, does the President believe that in order for the coalition in the Middle East, those who are supporting the United States, to hold together, Ariel Sharon and Israel have to make concessions towards peace, as well as Chairman Arafat? I mean, is there a direct linkage to the peace process and maintaining any coalition in this war effort?
 MR. FLEISCHER: The President believes that all the parties in the Middle East have to take advantage of what is happening today and see this as a moment to realize the repercussions of going down the wrong road, and that's a road that has led to terrorism and to conflict and in the Middle East has led to war. And that's why the President feels so strongly and has said this to leaders, that they should seize this moment and renew their efforts to accomplish a lasting peace in the Middle East.
 And toward that, of course, there was a meeting this morning between Foreign Minister Peres and Chairman Arafat, where they agreed to sustain their cease-fire and to resume security cooperation. And the President welcomes that announcement and that development from this morning. That's something that the President and Secretary Powell have been encouraging the parties to do on a rather repeated basis.
 The President welcomes a reiteration of both sides to their commitment to implement the Tenet and the Mitchell plans, and this meeting this morning constitutes an important first step toward the development of a more concrete and lasting approach to restoring trust and confidence in the region.
 Q:Ari, can I come back to the Chicago trip? Putting aside the issue, the specifics of what the President is going to announce tomorrow, does the President have a message behind this trip of whether it's now safe for Americans to fly again?
 MR. FLEISCHER: The President's trip is designed to talk to the airline workers and to thank them for returning to the flight schedules that they have returned to, to thank them for doing their part to combat terrorism and to get America moving again. He may have some additional things to say on some of the policy items that we've been discussing.
 But I do know that typically in America, there are some 5,500 to 6,500 flights a day in our commercial industry. There are now, today, or at least as of yesterday, 4,500 to 5,500 flights taking off and landing safely every day across our country.
 We're not back at exactly where we were prior to September 11th, but there are an awful lot of flights flying every day, safely taking Americans to where they want to travel, and that's an encouraging sign. There are just increasing signs of life in America is getting back to normal, as normal can ever be at a time where the President will still remind the American people that threats remain and the nation is preparing for war.
 Q:-- Americans not to be afraid of flying?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I think every American is going to come to their own judgment. And for some Americans, obviously, the 4,500 to 5,500 flights a day, many Americans have already come to the conclusion it's safe to fly, and they've safely flown. Other Americans are going to approach this on their own time, at their own pace, and the President understands that. So that's an individual decision people are making, but according to how many flights have been taking off and landing every day, that's a decision people are increasingly feeling comfortable with. The President will continue to remind people that it's important to remember the threat is not eliminated.
 Q:But they're only flying at 30 percent capacity, though, Ari, and that's the problem. I mean, the flights are in the air --
 MR. FLEISCHER: No doubt about it. It's exactly right. The flights -- when I give the numbers about the flights taking off and landing safely, that's not an indication that each of the flights is 100 percent occupancy. There is no question about that, and that's one of the reasons the President is going to travel to Chicago tomorrow and talk to the people in the airline industry, because they're hurting as a result of the lack of passengers.
 Q:The question is, I think, what is the President going to say to people to try to reassure the public that it is safe for them to get back on those planes? I mean, the planes are in the air, but what can he say to tell people, look, we're doing everything we can and it is now safe to get back in the air?
 MR. FLEISCHER: And that's one of the reasons that the President has been focused on development of a security package to help increase security and protection for the traveling public of both airports and airlines. And he'll have more to say on that directly, himself.
 Q:Related to Jim's question, to your knowledge, how many administration officials, White House staff, or in the agencies and departments are traveling commercially this week or next week?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I can tell you I know on last Friday, OMB Director Mitch Daniels flew home commercial to Indiana, came back, I believe, on Sunday. I'm flying commercial somewhere today for Yom Kippur. So it's been across the government there have been a series of travels. I think you'd have to talk to each of the different agencies to get the specific information.
 Q:Cabinet Secretaries also are routinely now traveling commercial?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Again, you'd have to talk to each agency; I don't keep track of all their travel. So you'd have to talk agency by agency. I can tell you about Mitch, because I just heard Mitch say that, that he flew home commercial last Friday, just as I'm flying home to New York commercial today.
 Q:Can I just follow up with one more on the CIA -- Director Tenet, the President, of course, having full faith and confidence in him. But in terms of the agency, the President has not, of course, wanted to look back, he's wanted to look forward. But doesn't he believe the fact that the U.S. had no specific warnings of these attacks that they're somewhat of an indictment of U.S. intelligence operations?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I think the President views it as a reflection of the fact that we are an open society, a free society; that the CIA has in the past been very successful in catching and preventing acts of terrorism. Obviously, the attacks took place on September 11th, they were not detected and they were not caught ahead of time. But the President's focus right now is on winning the war on terrorism. And I reiterate, he has full faith and confidence in Director Tenet.
 Q:Ari, an IMF official today made the statement that a recession in the United States was a done deal. Now, he took back that formulation but, obviously, that was his outlook. Does the White House agree with this, that a recession in the short term at any rate, is going to be inevitable in the United States?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, the President remains very concerned about the state of the economy, and that's one of the reasons he's having the meeting today, to talk to his advisors about what steps can be taken to help promote economic growth.
 Now, the President continues to believe that the tax cut is the right policy; the Federal Reserve rate cuts have been the right policy and that will have a helpful combination in bringing the economy back. But there's no doubt about it, the attack on our country September 11th has had an adverse effect on the economy. I'm not going to go beyond that. That's an economic definition of a recession and that will be determined by the data as it comes in.
 Q:The House next week is planning to move a farm bill, which, as I understand it, could add some $73 billion, $74 billion over the next 10 years. Does the White House support that bill?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Let me take that question and get back to you on the farm bill, Keith.
 Q:Ari, back to the airline security thing and Americans getting more comfortable with flying. There have been several incidents since the September 11th attack where people have intentionally breached security to prove the point that it is still ineffective. My question is, is that inappropriate or is ignoring that reality and arresting people who do that casting a false sense of security.
 MR. FLEISCHER: I think that at a time when the people at the airports are working very hard to secure the airports for the traveling public, I think it's not appropriate for anything to engage in anything symbolic of that nature. It's a distraction that prevents the people who are doing their jobs from being able to carry out their mission if people are doing it for the purpose of doing something symbolic.
 Having said that, the President understands that we do need to increase security at airports and give more protections to the traveling public, and he'll have more to say on that point shortly.
 Q:-- about the war, just for a second. Since September the 11th, have there been any serious -- underline the word serious -- discussions at the National Security Council meetings about bringing back the draft? And how does the President feel about the possibility of the draft?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Yes, I've asked that question, and the answer that I've gotten directly from DOD is no, there has been no consideration of that.
 Q:As Commander-In-Chief, what was the President's reaction to television's Bill Maher, in his announcement that members of our Armed Forces who deal with missiles are cowards, while the armed terrorists who killed 6,000 unarmed are not cowards, for which Maher was briefly moved off a Washington television station?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I have not discussed it with the President, one. I have --
 Q:Surely, as a --
 MR. FLEISCHER: I'm getting there.
 Q:Surely as Commander, he was enraged at that, wasn't he?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I'm getting there, Les.
 Q:Okay.
 MR. FLEISCHER: I'm aware of the press reports about what he said. I have not seen the actual transcript of the show itself. But assuming the press reports are right, it's a terrible thing to say, and it unfortunate. And that's why -- there was an earlier question about has the President said anything to people in his own party -- they're reminders to all Americans that they need to watch what they say, watch what they do. This is not a time for remarks like that; there never is.
 Q:The Washington Times reports that the Reverend Jesse Jackson has nominated himself to go to Afghanistan. My question is, does the President believe this would be useful, or would it be better for the cause of justice that since the former head of United Way is in federal prison for spending tax-exempt funds on his mistress, that the Reverend Mr. Jackson at least be investigated by the Department of Justice?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I've got no comment on Mr. Jackson's possible -- the Reverend Jackson's possible travel. I would just reiterate what the President has said, the he will not engage in any negotiations or discussions.
 Thank you.

George W. Bush,"September 26, 2001",Remarks Prior to Discussions With Muslim Community Leaders and an Exchange With Reporters,"The President. It's my honor to welcome to the White House my fellow Americans, Arab Americans, Americans who are Muslim by faith, to discuss about the current incident that took place, the aftermath of the incident, and what our country is going to do to make sure that everybody who is an American is respected.
I have told the Nation more than once that ours is a war against evil, against extremists, that the teachings of Islam are the teachings of peace and good. And the Al Qaida organization is not an organization of good, an organization of peace; it's an organization based upon hate and evil.
I also want to assure my fellow Americans that when you pledge allegiance to the flag with your hand on your heart, you pledge just as hard to the flag as I do; that the outpouring of support for our country has come from all corners of the country, including many members of the Muslim faith. And for that I am grateful.
I appreciate the contributions of time, the contributions of blood to help our fellow Americans who have been injured. And I'm proud of the Muslim leaders across America who have risen up and who have not only insisted that America be strong but that America keep the values intact that have made us so unique and different, the values of respect, the values of freedom to worship the way we see fit. And I also appreciate the prayers to the universal God.
And so, thank you all for coming. I don't know if you all remember, the imam led the service at the National Cathedral. He did a heck of a good job, and we were proud to have him there. And I want to thank you very much for the gift you gave me, Imam, the Koran. It's a very thoughtful gift. I said, ""Thank you very much for the gift."" He said, ""It's the best gift I could give you, Mr. President."" I appreciate that very much.
Q. Mr. President——
Assistant Press Secretary Gordon Johndroe. Thank you all very much. Thank you all.
Q. Mr. President——
The President. Yes? Wait a minute. I feel guilty that John [John Roberts, CBS News] couldn't—yes?
U.S. Intelligence
Q. Sir, Senator Shelby this morning had some pretty direct comments about his thinking that somebody needs to be held accountable for what has been characterized by some people as a massive intelligence failure. I wonder what you think of his comments. Is he trying to inject politics in this? Does someone need to fall on their sword, if you will?
The President. Well, John, the intelligence-gathering capacity of the United States is doing a fine job. These terrorists had burrowed in our country for over 2 years. They were well organized. They were well planned. They struck in a way that was unimaginable. And we are a united nation. We're going to go forward with our war against these terrorists. And our Nation should have all the confidence that the intelligence-gathering capacity of the United States is doing everything possible to not only keep us informed about what's happening overseas but to keep us informed about what might happen here at home.
Q. So how would you characterize his comments over the last few days?
The President. Well, he's a concerned American. I'm sure other Americans are asking how could this have happened, including the President. But what Americans need to know is that I'm receiving excellent intelligence; the CIA is doing a fine job; the FBI is responding on every single lead we're getting; and that we're doing everything we can to make the homeland safe, as well as everything we can to bring people to justice.
Usama bin Laden
Q. Granted the extremism, do you—and I'd like to ask the imam the same question—do you consider bin Laden a religious leader or a political leader?
The President. I consider bin Laden an evil man. And I don't think there's any religious justification for what he has in mind. Islam is a religion of love, not hate. This is a man who hates. This is a man who's declared war on innocent people. This is a man who doesn't mind destroying women and children. This is man who hates freedom. This is an evil man.
Q. But does he have political goals?
The President. He has got evil goals. And it's hard to think in conventional terms about a man so dominated by evil that he's willing to do what he thinks he's going to get away with. But he's not going to get away with it.
Airline Industry
Q. Sir, there were thousands of more layoffs in the airline industry today. What is the administration going to do about it?
The President. Come to Chicago tomorrow.
Assistant Press Secretary Johndroe. Thanks. Thank you all. Can we go now? Thank you. I don't want to shout you down, so let's just leave. Thank you.
Situation in the Middle East
Q. On the Middle East—think that's going to lead to a durable peace in the Middle East?
The President. Steve's [Steve Holland, Reuters] question was on the Middle East. Sorry, Gordon. That's what happens when you invite guys—[laughter]. You invite John Roberts in here—aggressive reporters, you get—Steve asked about the Middle East.
We're encouraged that there are discussions going on that could lead to the implementation of Mitchell. There is the framework for peace. There is the process now available. It's the Mitchell plan, which everybody agreed to, is the right way to get to a peaceful resolution in the Middle East. And there is a series of discussions that took place. Hopefully, there will be more discussions and that both parties get into Mitchell. And that's going to be good for America, and it will be good for the Middle East and good for the world. And so we're hopeful.
I don't know if you remember, but I said, out of this crisis, this tragedy that hit America, I do see opportunity. And one of the opportunities would be that there's some sensible thinking that goes into the Middle East and that people now realize that this violence, this terrible destruction of human life, is not the correct path to follow and that, hopefully, people use this example as—the incidents that took place on September 11th to bring some reality to the Middle East.
The discussions are moving on. And I want to thank the Secretary of State for staying with it, staying on the phone, and encouraging both parties to get to the table. And we'll see what happens. We're hopeful.
Chechnya
Q. Mr. President, have you changed your thinking on Chechnya, in light of what's happened since September 11th?
The President. Well, first of all, to the extent that there are terrorists in Chechnya, Arab terrorists associated with the Al Qaida organization, I believe they ought to be brought to justice; as you heard me say, that our initial phase of the war on terrorism is against the Al Qaida organization. And we do believe there are some Al Qaida folks in Chechnya.
However, I do believe it's very important for President Putin to deal with the Chechen minority in this country with respect, respect of human rights and respect of difference of opinion about religion, for example. And so I would hope that the Russian President, while dealing with the Al Qaida organization, also respects minority rights within his country.
Airport and Airline Security
Q. Mr. President, tomorrow you'll be announcing some new security measures, one of them likely to include some Federal role in training airport security personnel and monitoring their work as time goes on, moving forward.
The President. Well, we're going to deal with airport security tomorrow, as well as other measures, to try to convince the American public it is safe to fly. One of my concerns is that this terrible incident has said to many Americans—convinced many Americans to stay at home. And one of the keys to economic recovery is going to be a vital—the vitality of the airline industry.
I presume many of you came to Washington today by flying, and you're here safely. And it's a—we'll announce some confidence-boosting measures, some concrete proposals, and I believe we'll be able to work with Congress to get them done in an expeditious way.
Q. You don't support arming pilots?
The President. Army pilots?
Q. Arming pilots.
The President. Oh, arming. As I said, I look forward to any suggestion that—there may be better ways to do it than that, but I'm open for any suggestion. And the good news is, is that there's a willingness on Capitol Hill to work with the administration, and vice versa, to come up with constructive, sound ways to convince the American public it's safe to fly.
Q. How quickly do you think you can put these plans in place?
The President. Oh, some of them will be—some of them will take a while; some of them could happen very quickly. Just give me a chance to give my speech. You're trying to jump the gun on me, Stretch [Richard Keil, Bloomberg News]. [Laughter]
Q. It's my job, sir.
The President. You're doing it well, too, my boy. [Laughter]
John, no longer can you say, I haven't answered your questions. [Laughter]
Q. One of the three ain't bad. Thank you, sir. [Laughter]
The President. [Inaudible]—batting .333. All right.
Q. Thank you.
The President. Gordon, good job—no questions. [Laughter]",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-prior-discussions-with-muslim-community-leaders-and-exchange-with-reporters
George W. Bush,"October 09, 2001",Remarks Following Discussions With Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder of Germany and an Exchange With Reporters,"The President. It's been my honor to welcome a great friend of America to the Oval Office again. Chancellor Schroeder came to talk about our war against terrorist activities. We had a great discussion.
First, I want to thank the Chancellor for his solidarity with the American people and his strong statement of support for the American people right after the evildoers struck on September the 11th. I also want to thank Chancellor Schroeder and the German people for their outpouring of support for the victims.
And I also want to thank him for being a steadfast friend in a broad coalition that is determined to rout terrorism out where it may exist, to not only bring the Al Qaida organization to justice but to declare a broad campaign against terrorists and terrorism all across the world. There is no more steadfast friend in this coalition than Germany, and I'm proud to have him here.
We also talked about the Middle East and the importance that both of us recognize for that process to get into Mitchell as quickly as possible. The German Government has been very strong about working with both parties in the Middle East to get into Mitchell. I assured him we're doing the same thing. There would be no better stabilizer for our coalition than for the Mitchell process to begin in the Middle East.
But Mr. Chancellor, we're so thrilled to have you here. Thank you for coming.
Chancellor Schroeder. Thank you very much, indeed, Mr. President. I, obviously, very happily came here. And I'm pleased to be here, because it is important to us to show that—very much in these difficult times—friendship must prevail and does prevail. And I'm also here to express the deepest solidarity from the German side, which is not just words being said, but it's a fact.
We very much are in agreement about the fact that this fight against terrorism, which we are all involved in by now, must be a very comprehensive approach, indeed. The action that is being taken right now must be added to through political measures, through diplomatic action, too.
We also find it very important to maintain the strong degree of cohesion that we see at this point in time within the antiterror alliance that has formed around the world. We went on to agree that it was crucially important to dry up the financing for the terrorists. And we also find it very important to highlight that the action that is presently being taken in Afghanistan is not at all directed against the people of Afghanistan; it is not at all directed against Islam; it is far rather directed against Usama bin Laden and the very ruthless regime behind him.
We have also very strongly emphasized how important we find it that we do provide relief for the refugees and cope with the refugee problem that will arise. And I can only yet again emphasize the high degree of respect that I feel vis-a-vis the United States of America and the American President, how he has gone about linking humanitarian aid and assistance up with the strike in this fantastic way he has done.
The President. Thank you, sir.
Military Action in Afghanistan/German Contribution
Q. Mr. President, how close are we to using U.S. ground troops in Afghanistan? And Mr. Chancellor, what extra commitments did you make of German military assets today to the United States cause?
The President. Well, first, I think the American people are beginning to realize that this is a unique type of war. The first shot we took in this war against terrorism was when we started cutting off their money. And I want to thank the German Chancellor and the German Government for cooperating and joining with us in not only sharing information but making it clear to Al Qaida and other terrorist groups, we're going to cut you off financially.
Secondly, as you know, we've started conventional operations. And I believe Secretary Rumsfeld summed it up pretty well today when he made it clear that the skies were now free for U.S. planes to fly without being harassed in any way and that the missions have been successful.
And as to whether or not we will put troops on the ground, I'm not going to tell you. I think it's—you've got to understand, we will not share intelligence, nor will we talk about military plans that we may or may not have in the future.
Chancellor Schroeder. I have—and you might remember me saying that—never excluded military contributions coming from the Federal Republic of Germany. We most obviously addressed this topic today. But as you might easily understand, it would be entirely unhelpful to spread this type of information. It would only help the enemy that we're trying to bring down. It is obvious that at the given point in time, details will be discussed in all friendship, and we'll come to good decisions.
Intelligence Briefings/Anthrax Exposures
Q. Mr. President, can you tell us what prompted you to write the memo to Congress about briefing on intelligence matters, why you think such restrictions are appropriate? And could you also address what threat you think these limited anthrax exposures pose more generally? Is it linked to terrorism at all?
The President. Well first, Mr. Chancellor, we had a—we had some security briefings take place up on Capitol Hill that were a discussion about classified information, and some of that information was shared with the press.
Chancellor Schroeder. Oh, we know that trouble. [Laughter]
The President. Oh, you know that trouble, too. [Laughter]
These are extraordinary times. Our Nation has put our troops at risk. And therefore, I felt it was important to send a clear signal to Congress that classified information must be held dear, that there's a responsibility, that if you receive a briefing of classified information you have a responsibility. And some Members did not accept that responsibility—somebody didn't. So I took it upon myself to notify the leadership of the Congress that I intend to protect our troops.
And that's why I sent the letter I sent. It's a serious matter, Dave [David Gregory, NBC News]; it's very serious that people in positions of responsibility understand that they have a responsibility to people who are being put in harm's way.
I'm having breakfast tomorrow with Members of Congress. I will be glad to bring up this subject. I understand there may be some heartburn on Capitol Hill. But I suggest if they want to relieve that heartburn, that they take their positions very seriously and that they take any information they've been given by our Government very seriously, because this is serious business we're talking about.
And the second question about anthrax, that is serious as well. I want to first tell the American people that an incident obviously came up, in the form of a sick male who unfortunately passed away. And the local authorities, along with the CDC, responded very quickly. There is a system in place to notify our Government and governments in the case of some kind of potential biological incident or chemical incident. And the system worked. And now the system is even working better, because we have, in essence, gone into the building, cleaned the building out, taken all the samples as possible, and are following any trail, any possible trail.
So thus far, it looks like it's a very isolated incident. But any—any type of incident, any type of information that comes into our Government, we take very seriously, because we understand we're dealing with evil people. And as you know, I've assured the American people that life should go on as normal. But they also should know, the American people should know, that our Government is doing everything we can to make our country as safe as possible.
Steve [Steve Holland, Reuters].
Military Action in Afghanistan
Q. Mr. President, the Pakistani President says he was told that the bombing campaign would be relatively short. How long do you think it will take? And what do you say to some of these people in the Islamic world who are protesting the campaign?
The President. Yes. Well, Steve, I don't know who told the Pakistani President that. Generally, you know, we don't talk about military plans. And there is one way to shorten the campaign in Afghanistan, and that's for the—Usama bin Laden and his leadership to be turned over so they can be brought to justice.
We will have a sustained effort. But I want to remind you that this is a part of a larger effort, that our war, the war of freedom-loving people, such as the Germans and the Americans, is against terrorists as a whole. And this is one part of a large campaign. We—the coalition has arrested over 200 people that have been associated with the Al Qaida organization. All around the world, freedom-loving people are gathering information, sharing information, and bringing people to justice.
And what was the second part of your question?
Protests in Islamic Nations
Q. The Islamic protesters. What do you say to those people?
The President. I say that if they think that the—first of all, I think the message of the Al Qaida organization is one of evil and hate. I understand people's willingness to protest, but they should not protest the decisions our coalition is making, because it is in the best interests of freedom and humankind.
Al Qaida and Nations Supporting Terrorism
Q. Do you still want him dead or alive?
The President. Ours is a compassionate nation, as is Germany. We're both combining our resources to help people in need. There are thousands of starving Afghans, because there is a Taliban Government in place that has caused starvation and deprivation and discrimination. And they are now housing terrorists. And make no mistake about it: The doctrine that says if you house a terrorist, you're just as guilty as a terrorist, will stand. We're making that very evident to the world as we speak.
Q. Do you still want Mr. bin Laden dead or alive, sir?
The President. I want there to be justice. I want there to be justice. And it's Al Qaida, but it's anybody who feeds Al Qaida, who houses Al Qaida, who encourages Al Qaida. Any other terrorist organization that is affiliated with Al Qaida is just as guilty, as far as I'm concerned.
We're very patient people. The American people understand, and I know that the Chancellor understands, that this is a different kind of war. There's a certain sense of fascination with previous wars in Kosovo and Desert Storm, where people could turn on their TV screens and see high-tech weaponry burrowing into bunkers and massive explosions. This is a different type of war. There will be a conventional component to the conflict, but much of what takes place will never make it onto the TV screens. Much of the efforts that we talked about in the Oval Office will be efforts that you will never see until people are brought to justice. And therefore, there has to be a certain patience. I think the American people are beginning to understand that.
I will assure you that the people—the terrorists of the world will understand that I am determined and, having talked with the Chancellor, that he is determined to lend the resources of our Government to bring them to justice. If it takes one day, one month, one year, or one decade, we're patient enough, because we understand that the actions we take together are not only important for today but will say to future Chancellors or future Presidents, ""Here is how we fight terrorism."" We also understand the actions we take today will make it more likely that our children's children will be able to grow up in a free world.
The first shot of the new war of the 21st century was fired September the 11th. The first battle is being waged, but it's only one of a long series of battles.
Yes, Bill [Bill Plante, CBS News].
Domestic Reaction
Q. Mr. President, as you noted on Sunday, there's a certain amount of nervous anxiety in the Nation, fear of new attacks, now that the military campaign has begun. Will the new Office of Homeland Security do anything concrete to recommend to average people, that they can do to protect themselves?
The President. Well, Bill, I think the— you know, the people of America should go about their business, should go about their daily lives, knowing full well that our Government, at all levels, is doing everything we can to disrupt any potential action and/or to provide the security necessary for people to travel, for example. I'm briefed every single morning about what somebody may or may not have heard and what actions are taking place. And their Government is responding as forcefully and actively as humanly possible.
One of the reasons why this coalition is so important is because we share information. When Germany hears something about something that may take place here and vice versa, we share information. And so, we're on high alert at the governmental level.
But the American people should go about their business. And people ought to travel. And people ought to feel comfortable going to see the mighty Houston Astros play. People ought to feel comfortable going about their lives, knowing that their Government is doing everything humanly possible to disrupt any potential activity that the evil ones may try to inflict upon us.
Intelligence Briefings
Q. Mr. President, when you meet with the congressional leadership tomorrow, will you be specific about what they can and cannot relay back up to the Hill? Or do you just expect them not to relay anything?
The President. Well, I'm going to talk to the leaders about this. I have talked to them about it. I mean, when the classified information first seeped into the public, I called them on the phone and said, ""This can't stand. We can't have leaks of classified information. It's not in our Nation's interests.""
But we're now in extraordinary times. And I was in the—when those leaks occurred, by the way, it was right before we committed troops. And I knew full well what was about to happen. And yet, I see in the media that somebody, or somebodies, feel that they should be able to talk about classified information. And that's just wrong. The leadership understands that.
And if there's concerns, we'll work it out. I mean, obviously I understand there needs to be some briefings. I want Don Rumsfeld to feel comfortable briefing members of the Armed Services Committee. But I want Congress to hear loud and clear: It is unacceptable behavior to leak classified information when we have troops at risk.
I'm looking forward to reiterating that message. And we will work together. We've got a great relationship. Listen, the four leaders, with whom I have breakfast on a weekly basis, fully understand the stakes. They fully understand the decision I made. And they will have gotten feedback from their Members, and we will discuss it. But one thing is for certain: I have made clear what I expect from Capitol Hill when it comes to classified information.
Chancellor Schroeder. Let me add something. I hope that the German press corps did hear it. [Laughter]
President Vladimir Putin of Russia
Q. We did hear it, Mr. Chancellor. Mr. President, do you consider Russia's war in Chechnya to be, first, a war against terrorists? And has your view on that changed since September 11th?
The President. I've had very good conversations with Vladimir Putin about the war on terrorism. I know the Chancellor has, as well. I'm, as a matter of fact, going to be meeting with the President of Russia within 2 weeks, in Shanghai, and I'm looking forward to those meetings.
I have made it clear to him that I appreciate his strong statements about America's efforts and the coalition's efforts to fight terrorism where we find it. I also made it clear to him that he needs to respect minority rights within his country. And he listened very carefully, and I think he's appreciative that our message has been consistent. From the very first conversation I had with President Putin, I expressed concern about how his government was viewing the minority that exists and how they were being treated. So my position has been very consistent.
To the extent that there's Al Qaida organizations in his neighborhood, they need to be brought to justice, as well. And we look forward to sharing information with him, just like he's sharing information with us. He is—he was one of the first—I will tell you an interesting story.
I was airborne on Air Force One and put our—on September the 11th—and put our troops to a high-alert status. And one of the first phone calls I got through my national security office was from Vladimir Putin, announcing that he has stood his troops down—which is significant. In the old days, if we'd have put our troops on heightened alert, they would have put their troops on more heightened alert—[laughter]—which would have caused our troops to go on higher alert. And all of a sudden we would have had a conflict, a potential conflict out of the realm of the incident that caused the troops to go on alert.
So he quickly called and said, ""We're standing our troops down."" It's a new attitude toward relationship. He understands the cold war is over, and so do I, which provides great opportunity for not only America but Germany to work with Mr. Putin for our nations' interests and his nation's interests.
And I think we're going to find a lot of common ground, one of which will be to fight terrorism. But as I explained to him, it's going to be hard to have common ground if he represses the press and/or treats minorities within his own country in a way that the Western world simply doesn't understand.
Listen, thank you all for coming. Thank you, Chancellor. I appreciate you, sir.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-following-discussions-with-chancellor-gerhard-schroeder-germany-and-exchange-2
George W. Bush,"October 15, 2001","Press Briefing by National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, on the APEC Meeting","The James S. Brady Briefing Room
1:22 P.M. EDT
DR. RICE: Good afternoon. I'm here to do my traditional pre-brief of the President's trip. He is, as you know, headed to Shanghai for a meeting of APEC. And this provides a unique opportunity for President Bush to meet personally with 20 Pacific Rim leaders, including key allies.
Despite the press of the urgent business that we have in the war against terrorism, the President feels that this is an extremely important trip and an extremely important time to take this trip. His objectives are very important for it. Obviously, he will continue to build the coalition in the war on terrorism in listing Pacific Rim leaders in his counterterrorism efforts.
We've had excellent cooperation from the leaders that he will meet there, and so this will give him an opportunity to review where we are and to continue those efforts.
The President also feels strongly -- as you know, it's been a slowing global economy, and so this is an opportunity to spur, through discussions with key leaders there, strong economic global recovery and what can be done to do that. And obviously a part of that is the very important trade agenda that these leaders share. And, finally, he will have a chance for the long run to strengthen some of our most important alliances.
He regrets that he will not be able to go on to Beijing, to Tokyo and to Seoul as had been planned, but he will have bilateral meetings in Shanghai with those three leaders and with a number of other leaders, as well -- with Singapore, Malaysia, Peru and Brunai, and also with President Putin of Russia.
Of course, we're going to see our other friends while we're there, as well -- Australia, Philippines, Thailand and the others.
So let me open it up for questions. John.
Q:Condi, you said the President wants to go. But is it appropriate for the President to be leaving on such a long-distance trip at this particular point? And was there any discussion among his advisors as to whether or not it was prudent for him to go at this time?
DR. RICE: Well, John, of course, it was discussed. But the President feels very strongly, as he said to the American people, that we have to go about the business of doing what makes America strong. And he believes that one of his most important tasks as President is to work on strengthening our alliances, as I said, to work on the global economic issues here, to continue to build the coalition against terrorism. He believes he can do that best by going to APEC.
He will be in constant touch with his advisors here in Washington; in fact, Secretary Powell, of course, will be with us. And he expects to have frequent contact with people back here. But he feels it's very important to go ahead and make this trip.
Ron.
Q:Can I follow up on that and tell us how this trip will help you build your coalition on terrorism? How much of the trip will be dominated by what's going on here in the U.S.?
DR. RICE: When the President was first elected, he talked about the importance of strengthening alliances, of building relationships that you could draw on when crises came along; that you couldn't simply have relationships in which you've made the first call when there is a difficult circumstance. And, fortunately, with all of these leaders, he had built those relationships so that when September 11th happened he had almost immediate reaction from all of these leaders.
Now this will give him an opportunity, face-to-face with some of them, to continue to talk about what can be done on the war on terrorism. For instance, with Japan, when Prime Minister Koizumi was here, we talked a lot about the financial issues, talked a lot about relief efforts. I'm sure he'll want to continue to talk about those. The Chinese have been very helpful on the information-sharing side, and we'll want to continue to talk about those efforts. So it's a whole panoply in what is a very, of course, large-scale and broad-scale attack on terrorism. And so he'll talk about those issues.
Q:If I could follow up, how about with Putin and Chechnya and how that has evolved?
DR. RICE: Well, he has a broad agenda, of course, with President Putin. Again, the President had said that it was time to move beyond the Cold War to a new relationship with Russia. I think September 11th demonstrated the tremendous possibilities of that new relationship. We have been in very close discussions with the Russians; he'll talk with the Russians -- with the Russian President about the broad agenda, but also, of course, about counterterrorism.
And on Chechnya, the President has been clear that our policies continue to be concerned about human rights issues, to be concerned about minority rights issues; but to make certain that we also say to the Chechan leadership that a political solution is important to this. It is important for legitimate Chechan leadership to make sure that there are no international terrorists among them.
Q:You will be granting an interview, we understand, this afternoon to Al Jazeera.
DR. RICE: That's right.
Q:Can you give us some idea how long it will last, when it will it be aired? I understand you're taping it. And is this part of a new public diplomacy by the White House? And will the President do one also?
DR. RICE: Well, I'm going to do Al Jazeera; I believe Secretary Powell did last week, and there are a number of other officials who will. I'm sorry, I don't remember the details of how long this will be -- I assume 20-30 minutes -- or when it will air. But we do think it's important that we get our message out to Arab publics, and we know that this is a network that is very popular with Arab publics.
I hope to be able to talk to the message that the President has been delivering, that this is a war on terrorism, a war on evil, this is not a war of civilizations. The President has enormous respect, and all of us do, for Islam, for a religion that preaches peace, that would never countenance the violent deaths of innocent people. And I hope to get that word across. So that's why we're doing it.
Q:And is the President contemplating?
DR. RICE: We have not discussed this with the President. I'm going to do it; Secretary Powell has done it. We'll see what else happens.
Campbell.
Q:You asked the networks last week to use careful consideration before broadcasting the messages that were coming from al Qaeda and from bin Laden. At the time you said that you had people who were analyzing these for possibly secret-coded messages. What have the analysts found in --
DR. RICE: The analysts continue to look at these messages, Campbell, and they are continuing to see what we can learn from them. The point to the networks -- and let me just say that I think the networks have been very responsible in the way that they have dealt with this -- my message to them was that it's not to me to judge news value of something like this, but it is to say that there's a national security concern about an unedited, 15 or 20-minute spew of anti-American hatred that ends in a call to go out and kill Americans. And I think that that was fully understood.
We are still concerned about whether there might be some signaling in here, but I don't have anything more for you on that yet.
Q:Any specific phrases, or anything that you're concerned about that you think may, in fact, be signaling?
DR. RICE: We're doing the analysis. I can't promise you that we'll be able to talk about what we think may be there, but I can tell you that I don't have anything for you right now on that.
April.
Q:Could you give us the mechanisms here at the White House that you're taking in reference to these letters that are coming with anthrax? And, also, could you update us a little bit more on the situation, since that is under the auspices of national security?
DR. RICE: Well, in fact, it's under the auspices of Tom Ridge and Homeland Security. We're in constant contact together about it. Let me just repeat that there are just, so far still, the two confirmed cases of anthrax; several other strongly suspected cases. I think it's fair to say that we've had unprecedented cooperation between the CDC, the FBI, local and state officials to try to deal with these issues.
There also, of course, is concern about this mail that is coming in, and every case is being taken very seriously, every case is being examined. I'm not going to talk about security precautions that we take in any particular place. I think it really isn't good to broadcast what we do, but just to say that, like everybody else, we're being very cautious about what we open. The American people ought to be cautious about what they open. There is absolutely no reason for panic, but if the American people, anyone is suspicious about a package or letter, then they should get in touch with officials about it.
Helen.
Q:Does this mean now that the United States will sign the new provisions of a germ warfare-biological warfare treaty, which you have renounced?
DR. RICE: Helen, I think that anyone who really thinks that the biological weapons protocol as it is currently drafted would stop the likes of people that we're worried about right now from getting biological weapons would have to really think twice. We do not believe that the protocol as it currently exists, that this protocol serves the interests of the United States or anyone else that is trying to stop the spread of biological weapons.
We're working with our allies to think about ways that we might strengthen the regime against these weapons, but inspection continues to be a huge problem because these are easy to hide. That really has not changed.
Q:Can I follow up in terms of, do you see any link, any conspiracy in these anthrax letters, per se? And do you think it comes from outside the nation here, or -- and also, we negotiated these provisions that you are now rejecting.
DR. RICE: Helen, there has been concern about this particular protocol for some time. I don't think that the administration made any secret about the fact that we don't think that this protocol will contribute to the fight against biological weapons. It is an issue that we take very seriously and we're working with our allies on measures that might, but the protocol that is currently out there we do not think would help.
Now, on the issue of whether these are linked, we do not know. And we are continuing to investigate and we're continuing to try to put the picture together. I think, as the Vice President said, obviously one has to be suspicious that there might be some links here. But all that we can do is to continue to investigate and continue to try to put the pieces together.
Q:On a couple of issues; first to follow up on Helen. Is it your assessment that an anthrax -- the use of anthrax this way would require state sponsorship of some degree to get to this level? And then, second, the President last week said he was amazed at the level of hatred that's in the Arab world, and you just said it's important to reach the Arab public through this popular means.
DR. RICE: Yes.
Q:Why isn't the President doing Al Jazeera then? And what will he and you do to meet that challenge?
DR. RICE: Let's not go to whether he is or is not. At this point, he is not. There's nothing scheduled at this point. Look, there is a lot of propaganda about America and America's goals that is out there. And we recognize that we have to do a better job of countering that propaganda. I think that if the people in the Arab world were able to see the pictures of these American women, Christians and Jews, carrying women who take the veil to do their shopping so that they wouldn't have to be fearful, I think that if word can get out that the President has asked that American children do something for Afghan children, I think that if the word can get out to remind people that America has gone -- used force to save the lives of Muslims against Serbs in Kosovo, or to save the lives of Muslims in Kuwait or in Bosnia, that these are messages that need to get out.
I would caution who -- the notion that all of the Arab world hates us, though. These demonstrations are still thousands of people in countries where there are millions of people. And I think that there's a deep wellspring of respect and, indeed, Americans are liked. So we need to tap into that. There are clearly extremists who hate America, but we need to tap into, I think, the broad populations of these countries that have reason to admire and to like Americans.
Q:And then on state sponsorship?
DR. RICE: We don't know enough, I think, about these incidents yet to answer what kind of resources people would have had to have.
Q:The weaponized answer?
DR. RICE: I don't think we know very -- oh, to weaponize anthrax?
Q:Of the samples that have been taken so far, any evidence that they are weaponized forms of anthrax?
DR. RICE: I think we don't have any evidence of that at this point; but we're continuing to investigate.
Q:Condi, on two of the Asian leaders you'll be meeting. First, in the Philippines there was discussion that at some point we might send in trainers, special forces, something like that as sort of the first new front that you would open up here. Can you tell us a little bit about that?
And for China, the Chinese leadership has already been talking, equating terrorists with separatists -- Falun Gong, Tibet, hinted Taiwan. Is the President prepared to address this and what is he going to say?
DR. RICE: It is clearly our job, David, to make certain that we continue to draw a line in all of our discussions between legitimate dissent or legitimate movements for the rights of minorities and the fact that there may be international terrorists in various parts of the world. We've done that in the situation in Chechnya; we would do that in our discussions with the Chinese.
But we really do believe that people understand that there is a global network out there, an international network that has cells in so many countries that we really have to sit down with the leaders of those countries and determine how we can get them out. And that leads me to the Philippines. That story I think does not represent the level of thinking in the administration about any such thing.
But what we do want to do, though, is to work with every government in which there is a substantial al Qaeda presence to figure out a strategy for rooting it out. Because it's like cutting out a cancer now in 60-plus countries. You've got to get to these cells and root them out and disrupt them before they strike again. And we will certainly have that discussion with the Philippine --
Q:But you're not planning to send American personnel to the Philippines --
DR. RICE: I'm not going to comment on what we might do. But we will certainly have this discussion with the Philippine leadership on how we can address the al Qaeda threat, which clearly is there in the Philippines.
Q:On a day when suspicious mail got to the Senate, has there been any suspicious mail here? Any cause for concern at the White House?
DR. RICE: I really can't comment. Not that I know of. Not that I know of.
Q:Your interview with Al Jazeera, last week you asked U.S. broadcast outlets to be cautious, not to broadcast full statements, propaganda by Osama bin Laden. And Al Jazeera does this regularly. And it's seen in the U.S. over satellite networks. Have you made a request of the satellite network, will you make a request to Al Jazeera not to allow, not to disseminate this hate?
DR. RICE: My understanding is that Al Jazeera, of its own accord, has adopted some guidelines on how it might use these tapes. Let me be very clear on what it was that we were discussing. When you have these unedited tapes that are pre-taped, shipped some place, for 15, 20 minutes, with no commentary, you know, I think news organizations would be suspicious or skeptical of doing that with anybody.
And to do it with groups that are known terrorists, known killers who sit and use that tape then to incite people to go out and kill Americans, that was the discussion that we had. It's not an effort to keep information from anybody, it's just the nature of that particular vehicle.
Q:And the satellite channels that rebroadcast Al Jazeera, did you make the request of them --
DR. RICE: We've not talked to the satellite channels, we've felt that we could deal with this principally in the way that we have.
Q:Dr. Rice, given all the focus on coalition-building and the events on September 11th, is there still an appetite in your shop with Gary Edson and with others, is there still an appetite for the economic and trade issues that would normally dominate an APEC conference? Or aren't they just going to disappear?
DR. RICE: No, we're not going to let them disappear. The President feels very strongly that he has a responsibility to -- you know that he's thought a lot about the American economy -- well, the American economy can't be considered in isolation from the global economy. And, certainly, the issues of global economic growth, the kinds of discussions that we might have, for instance with Japan, the importance of trade to global economic growth -- the President is very devoted to that agenda.
He's going to be talking with people today about trade promotion authority. He really feels very strongly that that's an agenda that's got to keep going because, ultimately, stability and the kind of, if you will, quarantine against some of this will come from a stronger, more prosperous world.
Q:If I'm asked about Japan's role in this international coalition, Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armacost told the Japanese officials to, ""show the flag,"" meaning the Japanese government should be involved fully in this campaign against terrorism.
Now, Dr. Rice, have you seen the Japanese flag in this coalition, especially when Prime Minister Koizumi decided to send self-defense forces to provide logistical support for the U.S. military? And how important is Japan's action in this campaign in developing long-term strategic relationship between Japan and the United States?
DR. RICE: Yes, we are gratified by the response that we've gotten from Japan on the military side, where we recognize that there are important limitations that Japan imposes on itself, in terms of its constitutional responsibilities, and that's fine. But Japan has found very important ways to help with logistical support, with all kinds of support for the military effort. And we're really gratified by that.
We know that Prime Minister Koizumi has rallied his own nation to support this Japanese role. And we believe that it will have a long-term benefit to stability and peace in the Asia-Pacific.
Q:You see the Japanese flag, don't you?
DR. RICE: Well, the Japanese flag is alive and well in this coalition. I can't say that I know where it's showing, but I can tell you that it's extremely important. We're very pleased with the response.
Q:Dr. Rice, when you talk about the need for communication with the Arab world in terms of American goals and American culture, when the President goes to the APEC meeting, he would have an opportunity to try to recruit some of these leaders from that part of the world into that sort of message campaign. Will he do that? Is that one of his goals?
DR. RICE: It's an excellent point. It's an excellent point, because among the APEC leaders, of course, are leaders of important Muslim countries. And we do think that the President is -- that it's important to enlist Muslim leaders not just in the Middle East, but from around the world, to understand that this is clearly not a war of religions, not a war with the Muslim world.
These leaders understand the threat of terrorism perhaps even better than we Americans do. They know that terrorists are after the stability of their countries as well, these extremists. And so we believe we have common cause with them and that we can work toward a common understanding.
Q:And how --
DR. RICE: I think it will be broad. He'll talk all about this. But as you know, he's already talked with Ms. Megawati, President Megawati of Indonesia, he's been on the phone with Mahathir in Malaysia. He's had a lot of contacts in this regard.
Q:I just wanted to explore -- forgive me if you've already addressed this -- on a potential link to bin Laden and these anthrax cases so far. The President, in a way that was significant, said that there is some possible link, there's no hard evidence, but a possible link. Can you explain what leads him, you, others, to believe that link may exist?
DR. RICE: It's simply at this point to not rule it out. Secondly, just circumstantially one has to worry that there may be some sort of link because of the timing here. There isn't any hard evidence of a link of any kind, but we don't want to be blind to that link; it would be hard to be blind to that link, given what happened on September 11th, but there isn't any hard evidence at this point.
Q:Can I just ask, following when the President was asked in the Rose Garden, if you have anything to say about reports of the Indian army firing against Pakistani positions across the cease-fire line? And then I have another --
DR. RICE: We've just seen the reports of this. As you know, Secretary Powell is actually in Islamabad and he's there with the express purpose, both in Islamabad and in Delhi, to talk with and to counsel with the leaders of Pakistan and India on the importance of stability in the zone of control, importance of not having a flair up in Kashmir.
I can tell you that there were quite a few phone calls over the weekend -- a weekend ago, not this past weekend, but the weekend before -- concerning this issue. As we got ready to get ready for military action, the President talked to Prime Minister Vajpayee. He, of course, talked to President Musharraf. Colin Powell also talked to both. I talked to my counterparts. There's been a lot of back-and-forth. I think we'll have to go and see what's actually happening here; the reports are pretty preliminary. But there is a lot of diplomatic infrastructure in place to try to damp this down.
Q:Can I follow up?
DR. RICE: Sorry, the President is about to speak. I do not want to get in his way. Thanks a lot.

George W. Bush,"November 13, 2001",The President's News Conference With President Vladimir Putin of Russia,"President Bush. It's a great honor for me to welcome President Vladimir Putin to the White House and to welcome his wife as well. This is a new day in the long history of Russian-American relations, a day of progress and a day of hope.
The United States and Russia are in the midst of a transformation of a relationship that will yield peace and progress. We're transforming our relationship from one of hostility and suspicion to one based on cooperation and trust that will enhance opportunities for peace and progress for our citizens and for people all around the world.
The challenge of terrorism makes our close cooperation on all issues even more urgent. Russia and America share the same threat and the same resolve. We will fight and defeat terrorist networks wherever they exist. Our highest priority is to keep terrorists from acquiring weapons of mass destruction.
Today we agreed that Russian and American experts will work together to share information and expertise to counter the threat from bioterrorism. We agreed that it is urgent that we improve the physical protection and accounting of nuclear materials and prevent illicit nuclear trafficking. And we will strengthen our efforts to cut off every possible source of biological, chemical, and nuclear weapons, materials, and expertise. Today we also agreed to work more closely to combat organized crime and drug trafficking, a leading source of terrorist financing.
Both nations are committed to the reconstruction of Afghanistan, once hostilities there have ceased and the Taliban are no longer in control. We support the U.N.'s efforts to fashion a post-Taliban government that is broadly based and multiethnic. The new government must export neither terror nor drugs, and it must respect fundamental human rights.
As Russia and the United States work more closely to meet new 21st century threats, we're also working hard to put the threats of the 20th century behind us once and for all, and we can report great progress.
The current levels of our nuclear forces do not reflect today's strategic realities. I have informed President Putin that the United States will reduce our operationally deployed strategic nuclear warheads to a level between 1,700 and 2,200 over the next decade, a level fully consistent with American security.
Russia and the United States have also had vast discussions about our defensive capabilities, the ability to defend ourselves as we head into the 21st century. We have different points of view about the ABM Treaty, and we will continue dialog and discussions about the ABM Treaty, so that we may be able to develop a new strategic framework that enables both of us to meet the true threats of the 21st century as partners and friends, not as adversaries.
The spirit of partnership that now runs through our relationship is allowing the United States and Russia to form common approaches to important regional issues. In the Middle East, we agree that all parties must take practical actions to ease tensions so that peace talks can resume. We urge the parties to move without delay to implement the Tenet work plan and the Mitchell report recommendations.
In Europe, we share a vision of a European Atlantic community whole, free, and at peace, one that includes all of Europe's democracies, and where the independence and sovereignty of all nations are respected. Russia should be a part of this Europe.
We will work together with NATO and NATO members to build new avenues of cooperation and consultation between Russia and NATO. NATO members and Russia are increasingly allied against terrorism, regional instability, and other threats of our age. And NATO must reflect this alliance.
We're encouraged by President Putin's commitment to a political dialog in Chechnya. Russia has also made important strides on immigration and the protection of religious and ethnic minorities, including Russia's Jewish community. On this issue, Russia is in a fundamentally different place than it was during the Soviet era. President Putin told me that these gains for freedom will be protected and expanded. Our Foreign Ministers have sealed this understanding in an exchange of letters. Because of this progress, my administration will work with Congress to end the application of Jackson-Vanik amendment to Russia.
Russia has set out to strengthen free market institutions and the rule of law. On this basis, our economic relationship is developing quickly, and we will look for further ways to expand it.
A strong, independent media is a vital part of a new Russia. We've agreed to launch a dialog on media entrepreneurship, so that American and Russian media representatives can meet and make practical recommendations to both our Governments, in order to advance our goal of free media and free exchange of ideas.
Russia and the United States will continue to face complex and difficult issues. Yet, we've made great progress in a very short period of time. Today, because we are working together, both our countries and the world are more secure and safe. I want to thank President Putin for the spirit of our meetings. Together, we're making history, as we make progress.
Laura and I are looking forward to welcoming the Putins to our ranch in Crawford, Texas. I can't wait to show you my State and where I live. In the meantime, I hope you have a fine stay here in Washington, DC. And it's my honor to welcome you to the White House, sir, and welcome you to the podium.
President Putin. Ladies and gentlemen, I don't know whether I would have an opportunity to address such a representative audience of the press and media. I would like to begin, anyway, with words of thanks to the President of the United States, not only for his kind invitation to visit the United States and Washington but also for his very informal initiation of our negotiations earlier today. Myself and my colleagues are very pleased to be here, this historic building of the White House. And President Bush deemed it appropriate not only to tour me, to guide me through the premises of this house where he lives, he— saw almost every picture hanging on the walls of this great building. But it is not only very interesting, but it also changes for the better the quality of our relationship.
I would like to once again thank the President and the American people, and I would like to express our condolences in connection with the recent plane crash in the United States. As they say in Russia, tragedy does not come alone, and tragedies always come in many numbers. I am confident that the U.S.—American people would face this tragedy very bravely.
I would like to inform you that the Washington part of our negotiations is being completed, and our discussions proved very constructive, interesting, and useful and will continue at Crawford. But the preliminary results we evaluate as extremely positive.
This is our fourth meeting with President Bush in the last few months. I believe this is a vivid demonstration of the dynamic nature of the Russian-American relations. We have come to understand each other better, and our positions are becoming closer on the key issues of bilateral and international relations. We are prepared now to seek solutions in all areas of our joint activities. We intend to dismantle conclusively the vestiges of the cold war and to develop new—entirely new partnership for long term.
Of course, we discussed in detail the subject matter of fight against terrorism. The tragic developments of September the 11th demonstrated vividly the need for a joint effort to counter this global threat. We consider this threat as a global threat, indeed, and the terrorists and those who help them should know that the justice is inescapable, and it will reach them wherever they try to hide.
Also, post-crisis political settlement in Afghanistan was discussed. The most important thing for today is to return peace and the life in honor to Afghanistan, so that no threat originate from Afghanistan to the international stability. Of course, we do not intend to force upon the Afghani people the solutions; it is for them to resolve those issues with the active participation of the United Nations.
We discussed in detail our dialog related to strategic offensive and defensive weapons. Here, we managed to achieve certain progress. First of all, it has to do with the prospects of reaching a reliable and verifiable agreement on further reductions of the U.S. and Russian weapons.
Here I must say, we appreciate very much the decision by the President to reduce strategic offensive weapons to the limits indicated by him. And we, for our part, will try to respond in kind.
On the issues of missile defense, the position of Russia remains unchanged, and we agreed to continue dialog and consultations on this. I believe that it's too early now to draw the line under the discussions of these issues, and we will have an opportunity to continue the work on this—one of the very difficult issues—at the Crawford ranch.
We also exchanged on a number of topical issues of international importance, the Balkans, Iraq. And we reiterated in a joint statement the resolve of the United States and Russia to facilitate settlement in the Middle East and the early resumption of negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians.
We also discussed seriously the development of relations between Russia and NATO, including taking into account a changed international situation. We consider that there are opportunities for an entirely new mechanism, joint decisionmaking, and coordinated action in the area of security and stability.
We considered in detail a number of economic cooperation issues. The Russian-American dialog in this area has become recently more constructive and more tangible. Such major investment projects as Sakhalin I and Caspian Pipeline Consortium are gaining momentum. Successful is cooperation in the air-space, mining, chemistry, car building, and other industries. Direct contacts are expanding between entrepreneurs of the two countries, including within the Russian-American business dialog.
It is with satisfaction that we note a certain progress in issues related to the Russia's accession to the WTO, in recognizing Russia as a market economy country, and we've felt a great degree of understanding that such issues should be resolved, I mean, dealing with the Jackson-Vanik amendment, not de facto but in legal terms. And in this context, our Foreign Minister and the Secretary of State, Messrs. Ivanov and Powell, exchanged letters reiterating the resolve of Russia and the United States to observe human rights and religious freedoms.
Of course, the capabilities embedded in the bilateral relationship have not been fully implemented. The key—we have quite a lot of things to do, but we are confident that the success is, by and large, predetermined by our resolve to cooperate energetically and constructively. That, and I'm confident, would benefit both countries and which is reflected, also, in our visit to this country today.
Thank you.
Situation in Afghanistan
Q. Mr. President, welcome to the White House, sir. Mr. President, the Northern Alliance forces took over Kabul, and there are reports of executions of POWs and other violent reprisals. Can the Alliance be trusted to form a broad-based government? If not, what should happen next to stabilize Afghanistan, and what role, if any, should U.S. troops play in that political phase?
President Bush. First of all, we're making great progress in our objective, and that is to tighten the net and eventually bring Al Qaida to justice, and at the same time, deal with the Government that has been harboring them.
President Putin and I spent a lot of time talking about the Northern Alliance and their relationship to Kabul, as well as Mazar-e Sharif and other cities that have now been liberated from the Taliban. I made it very clear to him that we would continue to work with the Northern Alliance to make sure they recognized that in order for there to be a stable Afghanistan, which is one of our objectives, after the Taliban leaves, that the country be a good neighbor, that they must recognize that a future government must include a representative from all of Afghanistan.
We listened very carefully to the comments coming out of the Northern Alliance today. And they made it very clear they had no intention of occupying Kabul. That's what they said. I have seen reports, which you refer to, and I also saw a report that said, on their way out of town, the Taliban was wreaking havoc on the citizenry of Kabul. And if that be the case—I haven't had it verified one way or the other, but I wouldn't be the least bit surprised. After all, the Taliban has been wreaking havoc on the entire country for over a decade. This has been on of the most repressive regimes in the history of mankind. But we will continue to work with our Northern Alliance—with the Northern Alliance commanders to make sure they respect the human rights of the people that they are liberating.
I also saw reports—and I think President Putin mentioned this today as well—that in some of the northern cities, there was great joyous—a wonderful, joyous occasion as the citizens were free, free from repression, free from a dictatorial government. But we are both mindful, particularly mindful of the need for us to work with our Northern Alliance friends to treat people with respect.
President Putin. All our actions were aimed at liberating the northern parts of Afghanistan and the capital of Afghanistan, liberate from the Taliban regime. And any military action is accompanied not only by the military resistance but also an information resistance, what we are witnessing right now, exactly.
We tend to forget now the destruction of the cultural heritage of humankind. We tend to forget now the atrocities by Taliban. And we are talking less than usual of the Taliban harboring international terrorism. The information that Northern Alliance are shooting—are shooting the prisoners of war was launched a few days ago. The Northern Alliance was not in Kabul a few days ago; they were liberating northern parts of the country.
And for those who do not know, I will tell, the northern part of the country is inhabited by the ethnic groups represented in the Northern Alliance; I mean, Uzbeks and Tajiks. It is very difficult for me to imagine them shooting their own population. I utterly exclude this. If there are any instances in the course of the military action of the violation of human rights and treatment of the prisoners of war, we must investigate and take action. But we need proof.
Talking of this, we should not forget the things that we see: the way people meet advancing Northern Alliance troops, liberating the cities and villages of the Taliban; the women getting rid of chadors and burning them. And this, I would like you, ladies and gentlemen of the press, to pay attention to.
Thank you.
Possible Visit to Russia/Nuclear Arms Reduction
Q. Specific numbers were mentioned here with regard to the reductions of offensive weapons. When, and if at all, one could expect that such specific numbers made public be substantiated by some papers, maybe during a possible visit by President Bush to Moscow? And by the way, when could this visit take place?
President Bush. Got to get invited first. [Laughter]
Do you want to start?
President Putin. President Bush is aware of that, and I would like to reiterate: He has an open invitation to visit the Russian Federation, with an official working or a private visit, in any format, at any time convenient for him. I mean, the best time would be during the time of the beginning of the year, White Nights in St. Petersburg. [Laughter] Of course, the official part would start in Moscow, in the capital of the Russian Federation.
But as for the business part, I think that before that time, our advisers will continue working. And we, for our part, for the Russian part, are prepared to present all our agreements in a treaty form, including the issues of verification and control.
President Bush. I think it's interesting to note that a new relationship based upon trust and cooperation is one that doesn't need endless hours of arms control discussions. I can remember watching the news years ago and seeing that people would sit at tables for hours and hours and hours trying to reach reduced levels of nuclear armament.
My attitude is: Here's what we can live with. And so I've announced a level that we're going to—that we'll stick by. To me, that's how you approach a relationship that is changed and different. And we'd be glad to—and I looked the man in the eye and shook his hand, but if we need to write it down on a piece of paper, I'll be glad to do that. But that's what our Government is going to do over the next 10 years.
And we don't need an arms control agreement or an arms control—let me say this—we don't need arms control negotiations to reduce our weaponry in a significant way. And today you've now heard for the first time the level that I think is commensurate with the spirit of reducing our own weaponry and, at the same time, keeping the peace.
ABM Treaty
Q. You mentioned vast discussions on the ABM Treaty. What progress are you making? And are you convinced you won't have to withdraw from the treaty now?
President Bush. Well, I'm convinced that the treaty is outdated, and we need to move beyond it. And we're having discussions along those lines. We had good discussions today; we had good discussions in Shanghai; we had good discussions in Slovenia; and we'll have good discussions in Crawford. This is obviously a subject that's got a lot of ramifications to it. I clearly heard what the President has had to say and his view of the ABM Treaty. He's heard what I've had to say, and we'll continue working it.
But my position is, is that it is a piece of paper that's codified a relationship that no longer exists, codified a hateful relationship. And now we've got a friendly relationship. And I think we need to have a new strategic framework that reflects the new relationship, based upon trust and cooperation. But we'll continue to work it.
Freedom of the Press
Q. A question to President Bush. His advisers expressed concern over the situation with the freedom of speech in Russia. But after September 11th, it would seem to me that the situation is changing somewhat in the United States, too. There are special rules for covering anti-terrorist operation, bin Laden is denied any opportunity to present his views in the media— quite appropriately, in my view—and so on and so forth. The authority of the special services have been extended, and there have been rumors that some of your members of your administration went to Hollywood explaining to them a few things. Where is the line in the sand where—beyond which it is impossible to cross, delineating a voluntary restraint on the part of the media and——
President Bush. Yes. First of all, I have been trying to tame our press corps ever since I got into politics, and I've failed miserably. [Laughter] They get to express their opinions, sometimes in the form of news— [laughter]—any way they want to.
I asked them the other day, ""Would it be okay if I cut a 30-minute tape, a piece of propaganda? No questions. Just here— here it is; here's 30 minutes of me talking. Please run it not only across your airwaves but run it internationally, if you don't mind. I've got something to say about the conflict and our fight against evil."" They said, no, they're not going to do that. If I'm going to have to get on the news, they've got to ask me questions.
And so we extended the same courtesy to Usama bin Laden. He doesn't get to just cut a 30-minute tape, where he may be calling his soldiers to action, where he is definitely condemning all Jews, Christians, threatening individuals, to be able to put a 30-minute propaganda tape on the free airwaves. And we made that suggestion. We didn't dictate; we just suggested. And some of the news organizations—or all the news organizations readily agreed that was a responsible posture to take. And for that, I'm grateful.
But the press in America has never been stronger and never been freer and never been more vibrant—sometimes to my chagrin and a lot of times to my delight. But whoever thinks that I have the capability or my government has the capability of reining in this press corps simply doesn't understand the American way.
President Putin. I would also offer a couple of words. Today, giving a rostrum to international terrorists would be equal to giving an opportunity to—[inaudible]— newspapers of the Second World War times to—an opportunity to print Dr. Goebbels' articles. This question could be turned in the following way: What is the limit and what is the measure of giving an opportunity to the terrorists and destructive element to use media in pursuit of their antihuman, inhuman objectives? Let's look at it this way.
Situation in Afghanistan
Q. Yes, sir, Mr. President, thank you. If I could return to the situation in Afghanistan, where the concern seems to be a potential breakdown in civil order and a possible dramatic increase in civil conflict between the tribes in the Northern Alliance and other groups, which President Putin's country has experience with, what specifically can be done in the next several days to ensure the safety of the citizens of Kabul? And does the Northern Alliance, now that they've taken that city, enjoy pride of place at the bargaining table in the future of Afghanistan?
President Bush. There is no preferential place at the bargaining table. All people will be treated the same. That's what we're working with our friends the Russians on. That's the concept we're working on with the U.N. And that's only fair. That's been the vision all along. That's been the vision we talked about in Shanghai. It's the vision we have shared again today.
Secondly, I repeat, the Northern Alliance, with whom President Putin has got some influence and I've got some influence, has told us both they have no intention of occupying—and they've said this publicly—they intend not to occupy Kabul, which is fine. That's the way it ought to be. And we will continue to work with their commanders. We've got troops there with their commanders, and we will continue to urge restraint.
Again, I think before we jump to conclusions, we want to make sure we understand what the facts are, because the evacuating army has been one that has held this country—has terrorized this country for a long period of time. But any—regardless of that, any—any—army, advancing or retreating, needs to treat people with respect. And we will continue to work that they do so.
President Putin. Well, the thing is that the Northern Alliance did not take Kabul by storm. The Northern Alliance is looming over—has been looming over Kabul for a long time. That was our mutual agreement with President Bush. And suddenly, they discovered, all of a sudden, that Kabul had been abandoned, and they had to insert there certain security elements to prevent looting and robberies and murders. There was complete lawlessness in that city, and the situation must be put under control, and it was very difficult. It would be very difficult for us if we—to meet with the Northern Alliance leaders to tell them that they've negated their obligation.
The city of Kabul was abandoned by Taliban. They were trying to preserve their manpower and their equipment, a very cunning move on the part of Taliban. Maybe, technically, their decision was right, but we should not be deluded on that score. Quite a serious amount of work is still ahead. They did not disappear; they just moved out of the city, a few kilometers from there. And I am absolutely in agreement with the President on the need to follow the developments with a view to preventing abuses of human rights and maltreatment of the POWs, although the line we agreed upon has not been yet reached.
Dear colleagues, the final question.
Pakistan/Uzbekistan and Tajikistan
Q. Two questions to two Presidents. Mr. Bush, what is your evaluation of the situation in Pakistan, which was always in the sphere of influence of the United States, and whether there are any dangers that the forces up in opposition to General Musharraf would gain control of the nuclear weapons?
And to President Putin, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan made available their airbases and their air corridors to the United States Armed Forces, giving the green light. Can you tell us whether you gave a green light to that? Aren't you apprehensive of the struggle for power and influence in that area?
President Bush. I had a very good dinner with President Musharraf last Saturday night in New York City. It's the first time I had met him. My Secretary of State had met him in Pakistan, as had my Secretary of Defense and other officials in my administration. All of us came away with our respect for President Musharraf and our desire to make sure that his administration is successful in Pakistan.
The best way to make sure that terrorists do not end up with nuclear weaponry in that part of the world is for President Musharraf to provide a stable government and to fulfill what he said he would do, which is to have elections in a short period of time. And I believe he is—he deserves our Nation's support, and so we are putting together a economic package that will help him with debt, help him with the expenses of the ongoing operations, help him with trade. And we will continue a dialog with the Pakistan leader, with the full intent of finding ways we can cooperate, in order to bring stability to that part of the world.
President Putin. With regard to the possible redrawing of the spheres of influence and the enhanced American influence in the central Asia, I would like to say the following: I am more concerned with the presence of the terrorist training camps in the northern Afghanistan, who send guerrillas to the Caucasus—have been sending in the recent years. After Ahmed Shah Massoud was killed, I had a very, very sad feeling. That was prior to September 11th. And I told President Bush at that time that perhaps some serious developments are in the making. And this is concerning— this concerns me very much.
If we look at the relationship between the Russian Federation and the United States from the old standpoint, distrust and the enmity, that's one thing. If we are looking through the prism of partnership and alliance, we have nothing to be afraid of. This is one thing. Secondly, one shouldn't forget that both Uzbekistan and Tajikistan are independent states and decide, therefore, in policies independently, who cooperate with and at which level.
But focusing my attention at the following circumstance, and I related it to President Bush quite frankly—we've just mentioned President Musharraf. We all should support President Musharraf. This would be the right thing to do. And we agree with this, and we accept this. It is also true that American flags are being burned in the streets of the Pakistani cities; one should not leave that unnoticed.
In Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, the Muslim countries, too, American flags are not being burned. Moreover, those countries cooperate, for the first time, so openly and so consistently with the United States and with the international alliance against terrorism. Being Muslim countries with their own problems, none of them are squeaking or crying foul; they are trying to address their own problems on their own.
And in these conditions, the continued application of Jackson-Vanik amendment to Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, and so on and so forth, one wouldn't call it justified and just. We need to and want to build a new relationship in the new 21st century.
Thank you very much.
President Bush. Thank you.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-president-vladimir-putin-russia-0
George W. Bush,"February 01, 2002",Remarks by the National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice to the Conservative Political Action Conference,"Marriott Crystal GatewayArlington, Virginia
11:50 A.M. EST
DR. RICE: Well, thank you very much for that warm reception and for that terrific introduction, and I really appreciate. It's a great honor to speak to this group today. I'd very much like to thank David Keene, the Chairman of CPAC, and the leaders of the 70 co-sponsoring organizations for having me here to say a few words to you about the campaign on which we are engaged here in the United States of America, in Afghanistan, in every country in the world. This is truly a global campaign.
Organizations such as CPAC fill an invaluable role in our society. You are an incubator of ideas and a wellspring of energy that sustains the causes that we care about. And today, as free men and women who come together to foster change through honest debate, you represent the best in America, and it reminds us of the values for which we are fighting. You embody -- as America embodies -- the principles that are worth fighting to defend: Liberty, democracy, and pluralism.
I know that later this afternoon, you're going to talk to a panel about seismic shifts caused by September 11th. And those shifts were very much in evidence when the President addressed the state of our Union on Tuesday night.
Imagine for a moment that someone had sat you down on September 10th, placed a tape in your VCR and told you that, here's what the President's next State of the Union Address is going to sound like. Each of us placed in those circumstances would have reacted in two ways, both at the same time. As we heard him, and as we viewed the window through which we had just climbed, our stomachs would have churned with the knowledge that our nation and the world had suffered such a great catastrophe. And behind our veil of ignorance, we would have been driven and, in fact, reluctant at the same time to ask the questions, who and what and where and particularly why September 11th.
But second, our hearts would have been filled with enormous pride, knowing that a great nation once again had set its sights on great causes, that our defense of liberty is unabashed and unafraid and morally clear.
On September 10th, we could not have known that America would prove itself so stalwart in the face of such a great challenge. We could not have known that there could be so many countless acts of selflessness and outpouring to ease the suffering of our fellow citizens, and a renewed appreciation of the duties, the responsibilities and the privileges of citizenship. And we could barely have imagined the seismic shifts that were about to occur in international politics.
One of the most important and one of the most immediate shifts has been a renewed appreciation of American national power. Specifically, the importance of a powerful military used responsibly in the service of our values.
If you go back just a little while, there was a lot of speculation that the future of the American armed forces actually lay largely in so-called operations other than war, in policing civil and ethnic conflicts and in humanitarian missions. Well, I don't hear anybody saying that any more. (Applause.)
The fact is that there are real threats out there. Freedom still faces ruthless enemies. And America and its allies have to deter and, if necessary, defeat them.
Our military has done extraordinary things in the past four months. It has shown its power and its precision. It has fought an enemy unlike any we have faced in our history, and we've helped liberate a nation. It has really been extraordinary to witness from the inside, as those of you who have been watching from without have seen, what this military can do.
When we woke up on September 12th and began planning our response, I can tell you that the American military didn't exactly have an operational plan on the shelf, a template that said ""Afghanistan Campaign."" We especially didn't have a template on the shelf that said, your ground forces are going to be on horseback -- (laughter) -- your 19th century ground forces with your 21st century air power.
And the President was making clear to those who were planning the campaign every day that he wanted the use of American military force to be meaningful and effective. He was not going to use pinpricks to deal with the circumstances in which we found ourselves. (Applause.)
He understood immediately that only the decisive use of American military power maintains our credibility. But he also told people that we weren't going to respond rashly or do something just for the sake of doing something.
In a very short time frame, we did have a campaign plan for Afghanistan. It was a plan that was daring in conception and difficult in execution. It was truly outside the box, and eventually it was successful. It was successful because the way was paved by strong diplomacy. It was successful because we had a President who was determined and focused and patient. It was successful because we had a commander-in-chief who let his military do the job. (Applause.)
And it was successful because our military forces are the strongest and best equipped and most professional in the history of the world. (Applause.)
Tuesday night, the world saw the President resolve to ensure that our forces remain without peer. He will ask in his budget for an additional $48 billion for our armed forces, the single largest increase since Ronald Reagan was President. And, as President Bush said Tuesday night, while the price of freedom and security is high, it is never too high. Whatever it costs to defend our nation, we will pay it. (Applause.)
As a result of our resolve, the Taliban regime has been routed and all that remains of it is remnant. Afghanistan is no longer a terrorist-sponsored state but, rather, a state that is trying to make its way to a better future for its people.
But al Qaeda is far from finished. It operates in dozens of countries around the world and it threatens many more. And the President has made clear that we and our allies will not rest until the threat from al Qaeda and the network itself is no more. (Applause.)
We will pursue its members by every means at our disposal. We will disrupt its plans, destroy its bases, arrest its members, break up its cells and choke off its finances. And our enemy is not just al Qaeda, but every terrorist group of global reach. This is not just our struggle; it is the struggle of the civilized world.
The United States has made clear to leaders on every continent that there is no such thing as a good terrorist and a bad terrorist. You cannot condemn al Qaeda and hug Hamas. (Applause.)
The United States draws no distinction between the terrorists and the regimes that feed, train, supply and harbor them. Simply put, harboring terrorists isn't a very good business to be in right now. (Applause.)
Now, many nations are trying hard to do the right thing, to improve their border security, to enforce their laws, to improve their ability to track terrorists in their movements and finances. And the United States is actively helping countries to improve their immune systems against terrorism.
On the other hand, there are some who, shall we say, are not moving with alacrity to shut down terror within their borders. They have been put on notice.
The President also put the world on notice on Tuesday night, that our nation will do everything in its power to deny the world's most dangerous powers the world's most dangerous weapons. It is a stubborn and extremely troubling fact that the list of states that sponsor terror and the lists that are seeking to acquire weapons of mass destruction happens to overlap substantially. And we know that if an al Qaeda type organization were to come into possession of a weapon of mass destruction, they would have no hesitation to use it.
In his State of the Union, the President was crystal clear about the growing danger posed by such states as North Korea, Iran and Iraq that pursue weapons of mass destruction. The President is calling on the world, on our friends and our allies, to join us in preventing these regimes from developing and deploying these weapons, either directly or through stateless terrorist surrogates. This is a serious matter and it requires a serious response.
North Korea is now the world's number one merchant for ballistic missiles, open for business with anyone, no matter how malign the buyer's intentions.
The United States has offered a roadmap for reciprocal steps that would enable North Korea to take a better course. We've had no serious response from Pyongyang.
Iraq continues to threaten its neighbors, the neighborhood, and its own people, and it continues to flaunt obligations that it undertook in 1991. And that can mean only one thing: It remains a dangerous regime, and it remains a regime determined to acquire these terrible weapons.
And Iran. Iran's direct support of regional and global terrorism and its aggressive efforts to acquire weapons of mass destruction belie any good intentions it displayed in the days after the world's worst terrorist attacks in history.
All of these nations have a choice to make -- to abandon the course they now pursue. Unfortunately, these terrible regimes have shown no inclination to do so. But the United States and the world have only one choice, and that is to act with determination and resolve.
As the President said, we must not and we will not wait on events while dangers gather, and we will use every tool at our disposal to meet this grave global threat. We will work to strengthen nonproliferation regimes and export controls. We will use our new and budding relationship with Russia to redouble our efforts to prevent the leakage of dangerous materials and technologies. And we will move ahead with a missile defense system that can do the job, unconstrained by the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. (Applause.)
This President is determined and committed to protecting America, our forces, our allies and our friends from terror that comes packaged atop a missile. And the United States is unequivocal in its resolve to do what we must to insure ourselves. As the President said, the price of indifference would be catastrophic.
But even as we address today's multiple challenges, even as we recognize that the war on terrorism is one that will have to be fought for a long time to come, we can look ahead to tremendous opportunities that are before us. We want to leave this world not just safer, but better. We are committed to a world of greater trade, of greater democracy and greater human rights for all the world's people wherever they live. September 11th makes this commitment more important, not less. Because, ladies and gentlemen, you know that America stands for something real. It stands for rights that are inalienable and truths that are self-evident. It stands for compassion and hope.
September 11th reintroduced America to a part of itself that some had forgotten or that some thought we no longer had. And we will carry this better part of ourselves out into the wider world.
We are a generous people. President Bush and the United States of America are committed to channeling our noble energies into an effort to encourage development and education and opportunity throughout the world, including the Muslim world. On every continent, in every land, this President, the education President at home, wants to press the goal of education for all abroad. Because there is one remarkable thing about education. It allows you to remake yourself into something new. It opens up to you the full range of possibilities of what you can be.
You know, I am, of course, a professor at Stanford University. And I can tell you that one of the most heartening things about being a professor in a great university is the students that you meet. You look out at your student body and you recognize that at this elite university, there may be one student who's a fourth generation Stanford legatee, but sitting right next to that student is a kid whose parents might be migrant farm workers, or a kid from rural America who is the first to go to school in his or her family. And you think, that's what this country is about, it's a belief that it really doesn't matter where you came from; it matters where you're going.
Terrorism, the kind of hatred and the kind of hopelessness that gets foisted on people around the world, cannot stand in a world in which people have that kind of hope. And that's why education in practical skills, rather than education in hatred is so important to peace and stability in the long run.
We are moving quickly, with places like Pakistan, to help them improve their educational systems. We have a teacher training initiative with Central America to improve the state of teaching in those countries. And we are putting millions of dollars into textbooks and into teacher training for new schools in Afghanistan where, for the first time in years, young girls will have that opportunity as well. (Applause.)
America is a remarkable country. One that finds its unity of purpose not in common blood but in common values. It is a country that rewards creativity and entrepreneurship and tries to bring opportunity through education for all. But in our hour of need, we found a country that has been renewed in those values and a country that looked to honor and family and to faith to get us through. There is a lot to do ahead of us. But renewed in who we are, renewed in our common purpose and our values, we will succeed. Thank you very much. (Applause.)
I'm told that I can take a couple questions from the members of the organization -- this is not a press conference.
Q You mentioned Russia briefly in your presentation. I had an opportunity to spend time in Russia, Moscow State University, and had an opportunity to meet with a lot of the Russian people. And I just wanted to find out the type of relationship that we have now with Russia following 9/11, how you see that going in the near future. And if you could also talk about Russia's actions in Chechnya? Do you think that needs to be reexamined in light of the attack on our -- in New York City? Because they perceive that as an attack on their own soil and they wanted to go out and root out terrorism in Chechnya.
DR. RICE: Thank you very much. Yes, of course.
First of all, all the way back at Ljubljana, which is when President Putin and President Bush met for the first time, President Bush said that he wanted to seek a new relationship with Russia that was more in line with the post Cold War era, and in line with a Russia that is in transition to better times for its people.
One reason that we were so concerned that the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and nuclear arms control not be somehow at the center of the relationship, that was at the center of the relationship with the Soviet Union. This is a different relationship with Russia. It is one that is evolving and I think evolving in very positive ways.
There could be nothing better than a Russia that is at peace with its neighbors, that is moving toward democratic development, that is developing markets that can take full advantage of an extremely creative population. We want to see those things happen and we have been aggressive in pressing our economic relations with Russia and with others to try to help Russia fulfill that tremendous potential.
We will have our differences. Russia is a big power, the United States is a big power, and it's not as if everything will be wiped away right immediately.
For instance, on Chechnya, we clearly have differences with the Russian government about Chechnya. We've said to them that we fully agree that the Chechen leadership should not involve itself with terrorist elements in that region, and there are terrorist elements in that region. But that not every Chechen is a terrorist and that the Chechens' legitimate aspirations for political solution should be pursued by the Russians. And we have been very actively pressing the Russian government to move on the political front with Chechnya.
But we have gotten very good cooperation from Russia in terms of support for the war on terrorism. They understand that this is a global campaign, and they've been extremely helpful. I think it can only help our relationship to show us that we have this common security problem and to continue to work.
Russia has a long way to go. We've been concerned about issues of press freedom in Russia. We've made that known to the government, and we'll continue to make that known. But on the whole, on the whole, the transition that is taking place in Russia and U.S.-Russian relations appear to be moving largely in the right direction.
Q -- I would just like to hear your prognosis of how we are going to get that trade promotion authority this session so that we can move forward, and your prospects for a free trade area of the Americas.
DR. RICE: Absolutely. Thank you very much for the question.
Let me say there may be no more important thing that we can do for countries that are struggling to find prosperity for their people than to open trade relations to them. The President said the other night -- and he's determined -- the House has acted, the Senate needs to act. We need trade promotion authority.
This is not just an economic issue, although it will be good for Americans and will bring jobs for Americans, and that cannot -- I can't say that strongly enough. The highest, best jobs come with opening trade. It is also a tool for democracy.
One of the first meetings that the President attended abroad was the Summit of the Americas, in which it was remarkable to hear every country there, many of them -- many of these leaders who had been either jailed or in the opposition, in the '80s when you had military governments in a lot of these places, say we have crushing problems in our countries. People like Lagos of Chile or Fox of Mexico saying we have crushing problems in our country. But the answer to that is more trade, more democracy and a good relationship with the United States.
We have to deliver on the promise of trade so that these countries can bring themselves and their people out of poverty. It is a better way to bring them out of poverty, frankly, than all the development assistance we could possibly give. We do development assistance. It's extremely important. Institution building is important. But trade is ultimately.
And so the ATPA, the Free Trade Agreement for the Americas, we're pressing very hard. I think the prospects are good on the international front. But the President needs that one tool of trade promotion authority in order to be taken seriously in these discussions.
Thank you very much. (Applause.)

George W. Bush,"February 28, 2002",Press Briefing by Ari Fleischer,"The James S. Brady Press Briefing Room
 1:06 P.M. EST
 MR. FLEISCHER: Good afternoon. The President, this morning, spoke with King Mohamed VI of Morocco. The two discussed a number of regional issues, including the Israeli-Palestinian situation and the U.N.-led effort to find a solution to the Western Sahara dispute. President Bush reiterated the high value that the United States places on its deep and friendly relationships with Morocco.
 After that, the President received his usual round of morning briefings, and then he convened a meeting of the Homeland Security Council. He's having his regular weekly lunch with the Vice President today. And then the President will depart from the White House to make a speech at the 2002 National Summit on Retirement Savings, where the President is going to discuss what in his opinion is a vital issue for all Americans as they get ready to retire or as they are retired, and that is affording them the best nest eggs, the biggest nest eggs possible so they can retire in happiness and comfort.
 The President will focus on the pension changes that were already enacted into law as a result of the Tax Act of 2001. He will talk about his plans for pension protections as a result of the collapse of Enron, as well as his belief that the best way to protect retirement savings for younger workers is to allow them voluntary options of personal retirement accounts.
 Following that, the President will meet back here at the White House with a bipartisan group of members of Congress to discuss issues involving steel. And a couple other announcements, and I'll be happy to take questions.
 The President will welcome Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean Claude Juncker for a working visit on March 6, next week. And the President and Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern will meet at the White House on March 13th. With that, I'm more than happy to take your questions.
 Q: Ari, can you explain the President's policy? Do we plan to send troops and money to every country that has -- says it has terrorists? What is this Yemen move, for one thing -- Georgia and so forth? And where is the money coming from? And does he feel that he has a mandate to go anywhere in the world -- the President?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Helen, in the wake of the attack on September 11th, one of the things I think you've seen around the world is how the world has stood in solidarity with the United States, and has faced now the fact that terrorism does represent a threat to people throughout the world, in various regions of the world, people from all types of governments, whether they are democracies or whether they are kingdoms, and different types of regions.
 And the President views it as a healthy and welcome sign of the multilateralism that is present in a way that people want to take this threat seriously and look to the United States for leadership, for strength and for help. And the President is pleased to help provide it.
 So the United States will work very productively and closely with the various nations throughout the world, as they turn internally to deal with their terrorism, with the problems they have in their borders.
 Specifically in Georgia, the United States will continue our helpful efforts to recognize and respect and strengthen the sovereignty of Georgia. The United States has previously provided helicopters to Georgia, as was previously announced.
 Q: That isn't a civil war there?
 MR. FLEISCHER: In Georgia? Georgia -- in the Pankisi Gorge, there are clear threats to the Georgian government. It's a rather lawless area that is a sovereign part of the Georgia Republic, and the Georgia government faces threats there. The United States will provide training and equipment to help Georgia deal with that.
 In Yemen --
 Q: Threats from terrorists?
 MR. FLEISCHER: There are threats there, as a result of terrorist activities and --
 Q: Well, is this an intervention into a civil war?
 MR. FLEISCHER: This is an attempt to help Georgia to train and equip the Georgians, as they deal with internal problems in an area of Georgia that is known for its terrorist influence.
 In Yemen, President Salih has responded very positively since September 11th especially, in helping to fight terrorism. That is a serious issue in Yemen. And the Vice President will be traveling to Yemen next month, as you know. And the United States wants to work closely with the Yemenese government. President Salih has shown real leadership on this measure.
 So the long answer to your question, Helen, is, yes, the United States will work directly and closely with nations around the world as they combat terrorism. Properly and proudly so.
 Q: Leader Daschle has had some -- are you done?
 Q: No, I want to follow up. There is a U.N. organization, and if there's truly a collective problem, why are we taking it on alone, and where do we get the money and the troops?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, in the case of Georgia, for example, this is a training exercise. It's equipment and training that's carried out by the United States military. And I don't think you're going to see members of Congress --
 Q: Like Vietnam, you mean, when we started in there?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, I'm aware that even in Afghanistan, Helen, there are some people who make that analogy to Vietnam, but not many. And the President doesn't agree with it, and I think most Americans don't either.
 Q: I just want to follow up, quickly. What are the criteria for intervention? You say that there's a threat to the Georgian government in the Pankisi Gorge. There's a threat to the Colombian government in parts of that country, to the Nigerian government in parts of that country, to the Thai government in parts of that country, to the Indonesian government in parts of that country. What's the criteria for this intervention?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Terry, it's been the longstanding policy of the United States government to work productively with other nations. And that involves military-to-military cooperation; it involves diplomatic cooperation; it involves a whole series of exercises that are collaborative and cooperational.
 The criteria in fighting the war on terrorism is going to be to continue to listen to the needs and the requests of nations throughout the world as they deal with these issues. Terrorism represents a serious threat not only to the sovereign nations of the world, but to the international community. And it's a healthy sign that since September 11th, nations have stepped up in their efforts to rout out the terrorists where they are. And the President welcomes that, is pleased with this sign of people looking to the United States to provide strength, help and leadership, and he intends to provide it.
 Q: Just to button it down, so if a government comes to the United States and says, this problem within our borders we can show you is connected to world terrorism in some sense, the United States is willing to get involved?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, the United States has been involved for years. It's not as if it's a new development. But what is helpful and productive is the number of nations who now take it even more seriously and want to do more because they recognize, in the wake of September 11th, just how far these extremists and terrorists are prepared to go.
 Q: There has been a lot of political fire today in the realm of foreign policy, and I would like to start by getting the President's reaction to Leader Daschle's uncomplimentary comments about the war effort, saying that the continued success of this effort is still somewhat in doubt. And he talked about if -- we've got to find bin Laden and other key leaders of al Qaeda; if we don't then we will have failed. And he said, ""But we're not safe until we have broken the back of al Qaeda and we haven't done that yet."" Can you respond, sir?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, I think the President would remind anybody who would be critical that this is about much more than any one person. This is about much more than Osama bin Laden. This is about an entire terrorist network. And the President has been very proud of the bipartisan cooperation that he's gotten from Capitol Hill on this. He'll continue to call for members of Congress to engage in that bipartisan spirit.
 Q: Do you think that the Leader stepped over the line here in his comments?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I won't make any characterization of it other than the President has said repeatedly this is about much more than any one man, Osama bin Laden. This is about the war on terrorism more broadly. That's where the President is focused. Individuals are free to focus on any one person if they think that's the best conduct of foreign policy. That's a different approach than the President has.
 Q: Is the continued success of this war in doubt, as the Leader suggests?
 MR. FLEISCHER: The President has no doubts. The President believes the United States has been and will continue to be successful, thanks in good part to the bipartisan support he's had from members of Congress.
 Q: Well, let me just follow up on a different point. Can you amplify in your comments today that you believe that President Clinton may have actually unleashed, through his summitry, the wave of violence at the end of 2000?
 MR. FLEISCHER: That's a mischaracterization of what I said. In fact, I don't even think I ever used the words ""President Clinton"" when I talked this morning. I never did. So that's --
 Q: But you meant to leave the impression that his summitry resulted in nothing, and may have stepped up the next round of violence, didn't you?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Actually, let me -- let's review this morning. I was asked a question that had said, ""It seems that the violence was quelled a lot when former President Clinton had both at the table"" -- meaning Arafat and Sharon -- ""had both parties at the table"" -- or Barak -- ""had both parties at the table. And now that Bush is leaving Arafat out"" -- was the question put to me -- ""hasn't that led to the violence?""
 I would simply cite the press for a response to that. And that amplifies on what I said. All you need to do is look back, as I indicated this morning, that the violence began in late 2000 and escalated through 2001. That's a fact. And all you need to do is take a look at the press at the time.
 For example, The Washington Post, on November 12th, reported, ""Since the violence erupted September 29th, 209 people have been killed."" You can keep going if you want. The Los Angeles Times on November 14th reported, ""Four Israelis were killed and eight wounded Monday."" The violence clearly began late last year. So what I wanted to do was set correct the premise of the question that was put to me, which implied that the violence began only when President Bush took office. What you really see happening here --
 Q: But you didn't use any of those press accounts in your comments earlier. I mean, you stand by the comment that, in fact, the Clinton administration tried to ""shoot the moon"" but ended up with nothing and more violence resulted. I mean, that's what you said.
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, obviously, the violence started on September 29th. And so what you can see here, clearly, as I've said, the violence began in late 2000, accelerated in 2001. Is that --
 Q: But the line, ""shoot the moon"" --
 MR. FLEISCHER: -- is that the problem that all Presidents have faced in the Middle East, over decades, which is something I've said repeatedly, not limited to any administration. But for decades, there's been a problem of violence in the Middle East. I corrected an impression that was left that there was no violence in the Middle East when the parties were at the table.
 Q: You think President Clinton overreached?
 MR. FLEISCHER: The question was, wasn't there no violence or little violence when the parties were at the table. That's an incorrect characterization and I corrected that this morning. The point --
 Q: What does it mean that the Clinton administration shot the moon and ended up with nothing?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, there's no question the violence really began on September 29th after the Camp David Accords broke down. That's an historical point. The President's approach is to learn the lessons of all previous Presidents, and that's something I think that all previous Presidents, including President Clinton, tried valiantly to achieve peace in the Middle East. No United States President is to blame for violence in the Middle East. The only people who are to blame are the terrorists who carry out the violence.
 President Bush is intent to learn the lessons of all previous Presidents and focus on what he thinks can be successful, which is an incremental approach based on the Mitchell Accords, and not an attempt to have an immediate comprehensive solution, because he thinks that will raise expectations too high and, therefore, meet with unmet expectations and, therefore, create more trouble.
 Q: So, in hindsight, it is the view of this administration that President Clinton made a mistake, a tactical error, in bringing the parties together for a summit at Camp David, absent 99 percent of a deal? That you raised expectations, and in your words, ""violence resulted"" when those expectations were not met? That it was a mistake to try to bring the parties together when they didn't really already have a deal?
 MR. FLEISCHER: The point I'm making, John, is that the President thinks it's important to learn lessons of all previous Presidents, who have worked very hard --
 Q: Well, what's the lesson of Camp David?
 MR. FLEISCHER: -- who have worked very hard to bring peace to the Middle East. And President Clinton did work very hard to bring peace to the Middle East. But President Bush's focus is to learn from all these lessons from previous administrations, and try to bring the parties together on something that the parties themselves can agree to. And that's why the Mitchell Accords are so helpful and important, because the Mitchell Accords begin with a process that focuses really on what the parties agree.
 Now, President Bush, when he was a candidate, said repeatedly throughout the campaign that it's important not to proceed beyond what the parties agree to.
 Q: Ari, so after the question this morning, when you made the statement, ""shoot for the moon and come up with nothing,"" the Clinton administration did perceive that as passing the buck. So you're saying that was a mischaracterization of a question that was asked this morning, saying that violence was quelled ""a bit"" in the Middle East, and now -- when both parties were brought together -- and now that Yasser Arafat is not brought to the table, there is fighting, it's escalated. That was the context of the question that I asked this morning.
 MR. FLEISCHER: Here's the question. The transcript reads, ""But, Ari, on the Middle East, it seems"" --
 Q: I asked the question. I know. I know.
 MR. FLEISCHER: Right. It says, ""Ari, it seems that the violence was quelled a lot when President Clinton had both at the table."" And then that --
 Q: But that doesn't mean it was ended. It was quelled a lot.
 MR. FLEISCHER: I understand. But then the implication was, shouldn't President Bush bring the parties to the table, because that seems to make the violence go away? And I was noting that despite best efforts, the violence began late in 2000, accelerated in 2001. There's no doubt about that. Everybody acknowledges that's what took place. What's important is what can be done now to achieve peace in the Middle East. And in that regard, the President is going to continue to focus on the Mitchell Accords. But there's no question that there are lessons to be learned from previous efforts to bring about peace in the Middle East, not only from President Clinton but from all Presidents.
 Q: Was one of the lessons to never receive the Palestinians?
 Q: So are you trying to -- in a way, it sounds like you're back-pedaling from that statement this morning, ""shooting for the moon and coming up with nothing"", because the Clinton administration is saying that that sounds like passing the buck.
 MR. FLEISCHER: No, there's no question that the President's focus is on making an agreement that the parties themselves can agree to, and not pushing beyond that.
 Q: Can I try one more? Can I try once more? The Clinton administration's approach rejects what you just said. Their approach was -- and they learned their own lessons; at least, they would say they learned their own lessons at Oslo and the follow-ups here at the White House -- that the incremental approach was not getting them anywhere. That they wanted to bring the parties to Camp David and shoot for the moon, to get the comprehensive agreement, because every time they got an incremental agreement, on the way to the next incremental agreement there was backsliding. You say the lesson of Camp David is that that's wrong?
 MR. FLEISCHER: The President has clearly said, and he said throughout the campaign, that the best way to achieve a comprehensive agreement is through the series that Senator Mitchell, a Democrat, has recommended, of interim steps that begin with security talks, that lead to political discussions about borders and boundaries, et cetera, finally getting to settlement issues. And that's how you build confidence to achieve a comprehensive solution.
 It is a different approach. But the point is that for decades American Presidents have wrestled with how to bring peace to the Middle East. President Clinton tried valiantly to do so. Nobody should be surprised if President Bush has a different approach. What is important to correct is an impression left by a question this morning that President Bush's different approach has been what led to more violence, because that's not an appropriate --
 Q: Can I just clarify a couple of things, going back just slightly? On Daschle, do you -- does the administration disagree with Daschle's assessment that the administration or the anti-terrorism campaign has not yet broken the back of the al Qaeda network?
 MR. FLEISCHER: You've heard the President repeatedly say himself that the al Qaeda network is far less capable of carrying out any of the operations they were previously capable of carrying out. That has been severely disrupted and severely hampered. It does not mean that the threat has gone away entirely, because there does remain a threat, as al Qaeda tries to reassemble in other nations. That's why the President is still so determined to pursue this war. He believes it's been successful and continues to be successful. It is not over yet.
 Q: Do you feel as though -- does this administration feel they have broken the back of the al Qaeda network?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I would characterize it exactly as I just did in the President's words. I don't use any other words than the President's.
 Q: One other thing. When we go to -- with the action in Georgia and Yemen and other countries, is there any concern in the administration about spreading itself too thin? While I understand the desire to respond to those countries who are trying to respond to the President's call to go after terrorism, there still is a question of not only what is the criteria for picking and choosing where you do go, but at what level is the administration concerned about spreading itself too thin, as well?
 MR. FLEISCHER: No. The President believes that when it comes to fighting the war against terrorism, and winning the war against terrorism, it requires the nation to be prepared to do whatever it takes. That's one of the reasons the President has made his budget request to the Congress for an increase in defense spending, and he hopes that the members of the Congress, Democrats and Republicans alike, will not under-fund defense, as some have indicated they might want to do. It is important in the President's opinion to do whatever it takes to win this war, because the threats to our country are of that nature.
 Q: I wanted to ask you again, getting back to what you said this morning -- one of your statements says, first of all, at least the impression we got, that the parties have been pushed beyond what they were ready to give. You also said, they should proceed at a pace that is doable and not raise the expectations too high. The impression we got was that you were criticizing the way that the Clinton administration handled the negotiations.
 MR. FLEISCHER: No, it was that question, just raised differently, that John King just asked. And what I said is, it should not surprise anybody that President Bush has a different approach for how to bring about peace in the Middle East. And it's patterned after a recommendation from the former Democrat Majority Leader George Mitchell, and that is the process I just outlined, which is an incremental way to build confidence to lead up to a comprehensive solution, as opposed to a one-shot deal to try to lead to a comprehensive solution.
 Q: Can I follow up?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Go ahead.
 Q: Please. You also mentioned this morning that the President was willing to look at requests from all nations, as far as how to fight terrorism.
 MR. FLEISCHER: Correct.
 Q: Well, in the case of Colombia, Colombia is getting aid already from the United States, but the aid is strictly limited by Congress for certain objectives only. And I understand Colombia has asked the U.S. government to see if they can use some of those funds to help fight the guerrillas, FARC, now that negotiations have broken down and there have been Colombian troops into the zone of dissension. And my question is -- I think the President answered he has to abide by the laws. My question is, is the President willing to try to convince Congress to allow some of those funds to be used the way the Colombian government wants to use it?
 MR. FLEISCHER: The President is aware that there are different members of Congress who have different ideas about the statute that is in place. The President will, of course, continue to, one, support the Pastrana government, and do so strongly; two, abide by the statute that is in place.
 The administration is prepared to listen to the ideas from members of Congress. But I remind you, this is also one of the reasons, because of the FARC and the threat that it poses to the people of Colombia and the government of Colombia, that the President's budget requests in 2003, $98 million of additional money to help train the Colombian military to defend critical infrastructure, with an additional focus on the oil pipelines in that country from the terrorist attacks that have taken place.
 So we are already engaged with Congress in an attempt to do more to help the Pastrana government. And you are correct, the United States has provided a very robust package of aid for Colombia. I think it was $1.3 billion of support for Colombia in their anti-narcotics efforts, as well as additional money through what's called the Andean Regional Initiative.
 Q: Ari, let me ask a specific question, and maybe get a specific answer instead of your general on the Middle East. What U.S. administrations were you referring to when you said they shot the moon and got nothing? Who were you referring to?
 MR. FLEISCHER: And we're back to John King's question, and I'd really rephrase it the same way I did when John asked it. The President's approach is going to be based on the Mitchell Accords, to have a more incremental approach.
 Q: My question was in the context of the Clinton administration, though. So you're saying the Clinton administration --
 Q: I'm asking you what administrations shot the moon and got nothing?
 MR. FLEISCHER: The President believes it's important to learn the lessons from all previous administrations in how to deal with the Middle East, and I'd leave it at that.
 Q: No, no, the question is --
 MR. FLEISCHER: I leave it at that.
 Q: The question is, what administration shot the moon and got nothing, and what administration pushed too far, pushed the parties farther than they want to go?
 MR. FLEISCHER: There's no question that the President's approach to how to bring about peace in the Middle East focuses on the approach recommended by Senator Mitchell, which creates a comprehensive settlement, which is what the previous administration sought to do. But over the Mitchell -- in accordance with the Mitchell recommendations, it seeks a comprehensive settlement at the end of a series of confidence-building measures, as opposed to any one summit.
 Q: Why won't you tell us who you're referring to when you say ""shot the moon and got nothing"", and ""pushed the parties further than they wanted to go""?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I think I phrased it exactly as I intend to.
 Q: Are you backing off on what you said?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Not at all.
 Wendell?
 Q: Ari, back on Daschle?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Wendell?
 Q: Two questions. Did we misunderstand, then, this morning when you said ""failure to reach that level"" -- the level of expectations -- did we misunderstand that the failure to reach that level was, in your opinion, one of the contributors to the violence?
 MR. FLEISCHER: The President believes that whatever solution can be arrived at has got to be set at such a level that the parties can agree to it. Failure to do that can lead to a situation where expectations are set too high. And if expectations are risen to a level where then people are disappointed, people can act on their disappointment.
 Q: I'm sorry, I have a second question.
 MR. FLEISCHER: Go ahead.
 Q: The other question is, the President, early on in this war on terrorism, used to confine his target, or define his target, as terrorists of ""a global reach."" Is it no longer the case that terrorist organizations need have a global reach for countries to petition the U.S. for aid and support, and be given that?
 MR. FLEISCHER: The President never limited the amount of assistance the United States would give to other nations who were dealing with terrorist threats to only those nations that deal with terrorist threats of a global reach. It's been a longstanding policy of the United States to help other nations in their wars on terrorism.
 And Georgia is a case in point. Prior to September 11th, the United States provided helicopters to Georgia. The issue of Georgian sovereignty is an important issue, and part of America's foreign policy. So it's not limited to just that group.
 Your question? Go right ahead.
 Q: Back on Senator Daschle. Between his comments and those of Senator Byrd, is this a sign to you that the Democrats are seeking to politicize this issue, and maybe put it on the table for midterm 2002?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, it's never easy to guess what the motives are of the loyal opposition on Capitol Hill. Obviously, people feel heartfelt about various issues. Obviously there's going to be politics involved. Some people may want to run for President one day. But the President is going to continue to always work productively and bipartisan with members of the Congress.
 Q: Bobby Byrd for President? (Laughter.)
 Q: Were you surprised, given that until now this had sort of been an off-limits issue -- did it surprise you that these comments came today?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, there's a bottom line, and the President always understands that members of Congress are going to speak out as freely as they should. But when it comes to the defense of the nation, the President surely hopes that nobody will vote to under-fund our nation's defense needs, because the needs are serious, there is a was underway.
 The President has made a serious proposal to the Congress. It's Congress' right and prerogative to ask tough questions about it. At the end of the day it will come to a vote, and the President hopes that the Congress will continue its bipartisan spirit and support the defense budget he sent up there.
 Q: Ari, just to go back one more time to this morning and the Mideast, just wondering, do you still stand by what you said this morning? Or, in retrospect, do you wish, perhaps, you had either qualified or tempered your --
 MR. FLEISCHER: No, of course, I stand by it. I think that it was important to address what the question suggested, which was that there the violence had been quelled a lot when the parties were at the table. That was a misrepresentation, and that's why I said this morning -- I said it again today and brought some newspaper articles to show it -- that the violence historically began in late 2000, accelerated into 2001. The premise of the question was, the violence had really subsided a lot, so long as the parties were at the table. That's an important impression to correct.
 Q: Well, you went further than that. You went beyond that and said --
 Q: -- Senator Daschle and Senator Byrd's comments were damaging to unity on the war?
 MR. FLEISCHER: No, I think members of Congress have every right to speak out as they see fit.
 Q: Ari, the President -- Wendell asked about the global reach, whether that was a continuing standard. When the President first launched -- he also said that the administration had to be careful to differentiate between real terrorists and people internally in a country, in a dispute that are exercising their own political voices. Now, what's unclear to us, and hopefully you can clarify it, is what the criteria is now. How is the administration being sure that a country calls up and says, these people, we think they're connected with al Qaeda, so can you come and help us? The case in Georgia is an example of that. What steps is the administration taking? What criteria is the administration proposing to make sure that the standards the President originally set are, in fact, met as these requests come in from other nations.
 MR. FLEISCHER: The standard, broadly, is the national interest. And let me walk through the specifics.
 Georgia: There is the Pankisi Gorge, which by all estimates is a lawless area. It's an area in which the borders are hard to seal and are unsealed, in which people freely go back and forth between Chechnya and Georgia into the Pankisi Gorge. And this was the case prior to September 11th, as I indicated. And that's why the United States provided, and you received notice, helicopters were sent to the Georgian Republic to assist them in their dealings, to maintain their sovereignty over an area that has been hard to control as a result of the terrorist infiltration and the problems in Georgia.
 In Colombia, the FARC is a listed terrorist organization. It traffics in narcotics, it attacks pipelines, it hijacks airplanes, it kidnaps presidential candidates and state senators. I think there's no question that the American people want to help the government of Colombia put an end to that type of violence.
 In Yemen: Yemen is a country that is an area that also is very hard to patrol and to control, in the northern reaches of Yemen. And the administration is very pleased that President Salih is helping the United States.
 I think what's interesting here is one of the accusations that was previously launched against the President is why won't he work cooperatively with other countries. Here what you have is these other countries coming to the United States and seeking our support and the President is pleased to provide it.
 Q: Are you asking -- is the administration asking those countries to bring evidence that these people are true terrorists in the form that the United States wants to commit itself to battle, versus political dissidents?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, in the three issues I cited, there's no question about that there are terrorist issues in those countries.
 Q: What does the White House, or what does the President think about this idea of sending out certificates to Social Security recipients to guarantee their -- pretend, at least, to guarantee their benefits in perpetuity?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Let me take a look at that, because I'm not aware of what the White House position is on that at this time.
 Q: -- comment back and forth on the Hill about this today.
 MR. FLEISCHER: Yes, I know, specifically on that topic. You'll hear a lot from the President any minute now on what the President's approach is, broadly, to retirement savings.
 Q: In the administration's view, how serious is the danger of coordinated efforts between foreign terrorist groups and domestic terrorist groups? And are you taking new steps to combat this danger?
 MR. FLEISCHER: When you talk about domestic terror, do you mean domestic to the United States?
 Q: Yes, white supremists, black militants, and so forth.
 MR. FLEISCHER: That's really something you would need to address more specifically to the FBI, which has a lot more experience directly in domestic terrorist groups. If you want to talk about any specific links, that's really the place for that.
 Q: You said that the release of the 7,000 documents from Energy is unrelated to the GAO suit against the Cheney task force.
 MR. FLEISCHER: Correct.
 Q: Are you saying that in all of that 7,500 pages, there's none of the material that others have been asking for from the Cheney task force?
 MR. FLEISCHER: No, what I indicated is the statute under which the court held that the Department of Energy needs to speed up their compliance with the FOIA request is a total separate statute and is unrelated to anything the GAO is seeking from the Energy Task Force. Without my having any knowledge of what specific papers the Department of Energy has, I can't -- that would be an impossible question for me to answer.
 Q: The court, by criticizing Energy for this glacial pace at which -- you don't think that strengthens in any way the GAO case for the information on contacts with industry that the GAO is trying to get from the --
 MR. FLEISCHER: Ann, both those matters are in court, so that's for courts to judge, not for me.
 Q: Would this, though, make the GAO suit moot? If there is substantial overlap between what the GAO is seeking through its suit of Vice President Office, and what NRDC is seeking through its FOIA request of Energy, and the NRDC request is complied with, would this make the GAO --
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, again, legally there is no connection between the two. But that's a question you'd have to put to GAO.
 Q: What's your take on that? Does it moot the GAO --
 MR. FLEISCHER: I'm not a lawyer. I think if you want to know if it's moot, that's something you should ask GAO. But the statute is wholly unrelated. All agencies of the government must always at all times comply with FOIA requests. As I indicated this morning, I don't think it comes as a surprise to anybody in Washington that people want their FOIA requests answered faster.
 In this case, the court held that the Department of Energy needed to speed up its compliance with the FOIA request. That's wholly unrelated to a legal case involving GAO seeking documents from the Cheney task force.
 Q: One more follow. Would the White House possibly argue that the GAO suit is now moot because the material is covered under this separate matter?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I have heard no such claim by the White House.
 Q: Is it not a setback to the White House that the very documents it's trying to protect in the Energy Task Force and the Vice President's Office could now be released en masse by the Energy Department per a judge's order?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, again, as I answered to Ann's question about the documents, themselves, without having knowledge of what documents specifically the Department of Energy required under its FOIA to give up, it's impossible to say what overlap, if any, there is with documents sought by GAO.
 Q: But it's represented that they are many of the same documents that are coming from the Energy Task Force --
 MR. FLEISCHER: And whose representations were those?
 Q: The judge's and the Energy Department, it's coming from Spencer Abraham, who is on the task force.
 MR. FLEISCHER: At the time the documents are released, you'll be able to evaluate that.
 Q: You just don't know?
 MR. FLEISCHER: That's what I answered -- is correct.
 Q: Ari, but in answering FOIA requests, agencies often redact a great deal of the material even that they release to the press. You will get a document that says, Department of Energy, with black lines through everything on the page of paper, thank you very much. Are there White House lawyers or Cheney task force lawyers reviewing what the Energy Department is about to release, and raising any objections, saying, we want this redacted on grounds of executive privilege, or on grounds of pending legal matter? Are the documents being -- is this an Energy Department decision alone, or are White House lawyers involved in the decision over how to handle the release of those documents?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I don't know if any White House lawyers are or are not involved. I know that the Department of Energy lawyers are taking a look at the judge's findings and they will comply with it, just as Energy indicated.
 Q: Ari, back on the Middle East. You said former President Clinton tried valiantly, but President Bush has a different approach in his dealing with the Mitchell Accords.
 MR. FLEISCHER: Correct.
 Q: Is that approach working, in the midst of all of this escalated violence?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, to reiterate, the situation in the Middle East has been very difficult for many a United States President. And President Bush is not the first to wrestle with this. The President is encouraged in the fact that this week the security talks have taken place. There had been a long period of time in which the security talks were not even taking place. That is the first step of the Mitchell Accords. There have been meetings between the Israelis and the Palestinians to discuss security arrangements in the Middle East.
 The President would like to see that accelerated so that the Mitchell Accord can be entered into in a more meaningful and longer-lasting way. The President will continue to press all the parties to comply with the Mitchell Accords, so it's a question of time.
 Q: And a follow-up to that: Is Yasser Arafat really not invited to the table as of yet?
 MR. FLEISCHER: As always, as I announced this morning, the visit by two leaders; if there's anything to announce, we'll announce it. There's nothing to announce on that topic.
 Q: Ari, both The Washington Post and Fox News reported this week that an Islamic school just outside Washington is using a textbook with the statement -- and this is a quote -- The day of judgment can't come until Jesus Christ returns to Earth, breaks the cross and converts everyone to Islam, and until Muslims start attacking Jews -- end of quote. How does this fit in with your claim that Islam is a religion of peace?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Lester, nothing that you will be able to cite as any individual case is going to change the President's view that Islam is a religion that represents peace.
 Q: Does this sound peaceful?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I think when you look broadly at any society, you're going to find individual statements, no matter where they are, that reasonable people disagree with, and disagree strongly.
 Q: The Raleigh News and Observer reports another notable speech in North Carolina where Tipper Gore called for what she termed ""ripping up of our Armed Forces' policy of don't ask don't tell,"" and ""we cannot rest until Congress adopts federal hate crime legislation that includes sexual orientation."" And my question, is the President giving any consideration to such a ripping up of the don't ask don't tell, or for hate crime legislation including all sexual orientations, like S&M and necrophilia and that sort of thing?
 MR. FLEISCHER: No, Lester, there's no change in the President's positions. Thank you.

George W. Bush,"May 07, 2002",Press Briefing by Ari Fleischer,"12:34 P.M. EDT
 MR. FLEISCHER: Good afternoon. Let me give you an update on the President's day, and a statement, and then I'll be happy to take your questions.
 The President began his day this morning with a phone call to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The phone call lasted approximately 15 minutes. The two Presidents noted the progress their negotiators are making on an agreement to reduce offensive nuclear weapons, and expressed hope that the agreement would be ready for their signature when the President travels to Moscow at the end of this month. The President told President Putin that he's looking forward to making the trip to Russia.
 The two Presidents also noted Georgia's progress in its fight against international terrorists residing in the Pankisi Gorge, near the Chechan border. And President Bush also urged that Russia pursue a political settlement to the Chechnya conflict. And finally, the two Presidents also discussed the dispute over poultry, and the President urged a prompt resolution of that matter.
 President Bush, also this morning, called Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. The two spoke for 10 minutes. President Bush expressed his desire for peace and for long-lasting results that will be meaningful in the region. And he emphasized the importance of improving the human conditions for the Palestinian people. He also told President Mubarak that he welcomed Egypt's leadership and helpful role in the region.
 Later this afternoon, the President will also call the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia to continue his discussions about ongoing peace efforts in the region.
 The President had, after his phone call to President Putin, his morning intelligence briefing, followed by his FBI briefing. The President participated in the event and gave a speech about the renaming of the Old Executive Building as the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. And early afternoon, the President will meet in the Oval Office with the Prime Minister of Nepal, where the President will reaffirm America's strong support for democracy in Nepal. They will talk about regional security issues, as well as economic and educational cooperation.
 And finally, this afternoon the President will meet with Prime Minister of Israel Ariel Sharon in the Oval Office, where they will discuss ongoing progress and process of bringing peace to the region.
 One announcement I want to give you -- or a statement, I'm sorry. The Permanent 5 members, or the Perm 5 members of the United Nations Security Council have agreed on a new system to implement economic sanctions on Iraq. This is a step forward. The Goods Review List promises to tighten controls over Iraq's illicit efforts to acquire material for its weapons of mass destruction programs, and allow for the freer flow of humanitarian goods to the Iraqi people. We expect the full Security Council to discuss, and then to vote in favor of this positive action this week.
 The Iraqi people will benefit from this new system. However, they will fail to realize the expected benefits if Saddam Hussein continues to manipulate the overall Oil for Food program. Saddam Hussein cut off oil exports for one month, exacerbating problems with funding in a vital humanitarian program for the Iraqi people. He undermines the program with illicit oil sales and schemes to force buyers to provide cash kickbacks.
 This program -- before it was referred to by the President as swiss cheese. The President thinks it is very effective now to have a tighter sanctions regime in place that prevents the Iraqi regime from getting access to material that can help it produce weapons or engage in war, while at the same time expressing America's longstanding humanitarian concern for the needs of the people of the region.
 And with that, I'm happy to take your questions.
 Q: Ari, last night, Prime Minister Sharon thanked the United States for what he said was its support in blocking the U.N. investigation into the crackdown in Jenin. Was that an accurate description of the U.S. role, and do you accept that thanks from Sharon?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Randy, I would want to look at a verbatim transcript of what the Prime Minister said before --
 Q: I have one. I can read from it if --
 MR. FLEISCHER: I'd be happy to hear it verbatim and look at in a full context. But what the President made clear was that the United States wanted to have transparency in Jenin, the United States wanted to get to the bottom of what took place. And the United States, we thought it was unfortunate that it was not able to proceed.
 Q: Can you say equivocally that you didn't give Sharon a bye on the U.N. inspection team in Jenin in exchange for his cooperation to end the siege of Ramallah?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I think that question was put directly to Dr. Rice and she said no.
 Q: Ari, is the President prepared to say specifically what he would like to see come out of this international peace conference? I know that's something they're going to talk about today, but a lot of the concerns have been raised by some of the Arab countries about why they don't want to sign on is that there's no goal at this point, other than to talk. Are we, before we make a real commitment to it, going to enunciate a series of goals that the administration wants to see accomplished?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, here's the path to peace that the President has outlined, and it has multiple parts to it. And it involves, first and foremost, the President's summitry, which you've seen in Crawford with the Crown Prince, you should see it today with Prime Minister Sharon's visit; the phone calls that the President is making, with a call he'll make this afternoon to the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia. That will be the 55th phone call the President has placed directly to an Arab head of state since he took office on January 20, 2001.
 He has had -- the meeting with King Abdullah of Jordan tomorrow will be the President's 13th summit in person with an Arab head of state. His meeting with Prime Minister Sharon today will be his fifth meeting with the Prime Minister. So the President, on a personal level, is working the phones and holding meetings.
 Secretary Powell has traveled to the region and is prepared to do so again when he thinks the time is right. And, as well, will be this meeting this summer -- much of the work, the principals and the players are all still being worked by the State Department in concert with many of our allies and friends.
 So it's part of a multiple stage of diplomacy. And the President believes it's far, far better for the parties to be talking than to be engaging in war. And that's part of what this meeting is focused on.
 Q: Is the President seeking to attach conditions, monitoring of the distribution of aid to the Palestinians from the United States, from the EU, from Arab countries, in order to cure the problem of corruption which you've spoken of here? Is the President seeking to put teeth in that criticism by attaching conditions to the distribution of aid to the Palestinians?
 MR. FLEISCHER: The President is very worried about corruption in the Palestinian Authority. He views this as an issue that the Palestinian Authority has got to confront and to take on, to make certain that the money that not only the United States provides, but that humanitarian concerns throughout the world, including the United Nations, provides to the Palestinian Authority indeed make it into the hands of the Palestinian people.
 At all times, United States programs are reviewed to make certain that they go into the hands of the people who are intended to receive them. And this is something the President discussed in Monterrey. And so this will be an ongoing item of concern that the President and the State Department will continue to monitor and make sure it's done right.
 Q: But in talking to somebody like President Mubarak -- you said he discussed improving conditions for the Palestinian people -- is the President also telling Arab leaders that, when you disburse money to the Palestinians, monitor it, we'd like to see precisely where it goes and be able to follow the money trail?
 MR. FLEISCHER: The core, Terry, of the President's message when he talks about Palestinian people and how to help on the humanitarian front with the Palestinian people focuses on a rebuilding of the Palestinian institutions. And the President wants to make sure -- and work with the Arab neighbors, as well as directly with the Palestinian Authority -- that as they rebuild and as they have financial help to rebuild, they rebuild with an eye toward transparency, democracy, fight against corruption. And it's an interesting way to measure the Palestinian Authority, because they have the ability here and today in the areas that they self-govern right now to demonstrate to the world their commitment to institutions that are dedicated to peace and stability based on the rule of law, not based on corruption.
 And so this is an ongoing part of the President's message to leaders in the Middle East about how to help the Palestinian people to help themselves, how to make certain that the Palestinian people have a Palestinian Authority that is worthy.
 Q: And the last question on this, is this a way to grow or to cultivate a new generation of Palestinian leaders, outside of the Arafat circle, that might be more acceptable to Israel's interlocutors --
 MR. FLEISCHER: Terry, it's just the right thing to do in the President's opinion. It's the right thing to do in order for the region to know that Israel and Palestine can live side by side in security and without risk of violence. And the best way to have neighbors live side by side is through countries that adhere to the rule of law, and not to the law of violence.
 Q: Is the President also monitoring the $10 million a day that we give to Israel, and all the arms and equipment, that they are really used in self-defense, after they actually have been used for aggression on the West Bank?
 MR. FLEISCHER: The President's position is abundantly clear on that. As you know, he said that Israel has the right to defend herself. Israel exercised that right --
 Q: Is an invasion of another country -- or another people, that is, entity, self-defense? And invasion.
 MR. FLEISCHER: Again, the President -- I refer you back to the President's speech of April 4th, in which he urged Israel to withdraw all its incursions.
 Q: Can you tell us, Ari, why the President favors an incremental approach to peace, as opposed to a comprehensive process as the last administration engaged in at Camp David?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, the President, as I indicated, is pursuing the path to peace along multiple lines. And the President is determined, no matter how difficult it is, to continue down that path to peace. And he has put this path in a way that it can reach out into many directions to see which one would be the most fruitful.
 There is no one magic approach to peace in the Middle East. If there was it would have been done and tried and successful a long time ago. The President does believe in learning his lessons from history and, therefore, he has established a multiple path to peace. And that involves, again, his personal efforts, and the meetings, the phone calls of Secretary Powell's, his travels to the region, importantly bringing in other nations, particularly Arab nations to help influence events in the Middle East, to help convince the Palestinian Authority about the proper route to go to secure peace.
 After all, there are nations, Arab nations in the Middle East that have entered into peace agreements with Israel; there are successful previous examples. And it's a multiple choice that the President is making to pursue the path to peace among all these avenues.
 Q: What lesson did he learn from history?
 MR. FLEISCHER: The President's point is that you have to move the process along in a matter that is consistent with the viewpoints of the participants in the process; that the United States can help be a partner for peace, but cannot force peace upon anybody. But we need to help all the parties -- the Israelis, the Palestinians, as well as the Arabs -- to reach an agreement that can be long-lasting.
 Q: Do you expect any new initiatives to come out of this meeting, specifically any kind of aid package for the Palestinians?
 MR. FLEISCHER: No, I think this meeting is going to be part of the ongoing consultation process. I do not expect any new initiatives to come out of this.
 Q: Ari, how does the President hope to convince Prime Minister Sharon that he has to deal with Yasser Arafat? What's his message going to be?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, the same way, Kelly, that the President has messages that he works very hard, and the State Department works very hard every day in convincing the Palestinian Authority and the Arab neighbors, as well -- through the long and patient art of diplomacy. I don't think anybody can look at one meeting as a magic moment. I think that people are going to want to look at the meeting today and the meeting he had with Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince, the meeting tomorrow with King Abdullah, phone calls he makes as all part of an ongoing, lengthy process which is starting to bear at least some fruit.
 Q: But when Mr. Sharon is expected to say that future negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians cannot include Yasser Arafat, how is the President going to --
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, let's see. Allow the meeting to take place. Let's see exactly what the Prime Minister says to the President. You'll have your opportunity to ask questions of the President after the meeting, and as well, we'll provide other information once the meeting is over.
 Q: Final follow-up. Unrelated follow-up.
 MR. FLEISCHER: Final follow-up, Kelly. Follow-up number seven.
 Q: Does the administration have any evidence that the Saudis have been giving money to Hamas or to the families of Palestinian suicide bombers? Does the U.S. have any evidence of that?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Secretary Powell said Sunday when he was asked the exact same question, and nothing has chanced since then, we have raised that matter with the Saudis; the Saudis have given us assurances that they are not doing that. And the United States accepts those assurances.
 Q: Ari, the last time that the Nepali Prime Minister visited the White House was during President Kennedy's term, 40 years ago. This is the first time in 40 years that this leader is coming to the White House to meet with President Bush, this afternoon. What I'm asking you, you think his visit has not been overshadowed by more famous leaders today meeting with President Bush than this very tiny Hindu state in the world? And is President Bush really very well briefed on the problems in Nepal from Maoist terrorism, and also the economic, the economy and all that?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, first of all, I think any time a visiting head of state has an opportunity to meet with the President of the United States in the Oval Office, they will be the first to tell you how welcome they feel, and what a nice reflection it is of the United States that no matter what is going on in the world, the United States treats visiting heads of state with dignity and grace, and welcomes them into the Oval Office. And that is exactly what the President will do with the Prime Minister.
 Nepal is fighting a Maoist rebellion, and Nepal is an example, again, of a democracy. And the United States is committed to helping Nepal. There's a request by the administration for $20 million in the supplemental appropriations bill to help Nepal. The United States currently provides a couple million dollars of assistance toward Nepal. And so -- it's up to the press to determine what meetings are the most newsworthy, but the President welcomes all into the Oval Office.
 MR. FLEISCHER: Jacobo? We're going to move it around.
 Q: Ari, first question, following up on Kelly's question -- Prime Minister Sharon has practically accused Saudi Arabia of financing terrorism. The United States claims that Saudi Arabia is helping the peace process, especially after the meeting with Prince Abdallah. How is the President going to convince Ariel Sharon that Saudi Arabia can play a major role in the peace process if that's what the Prime Minister believes?
 MR. FLEISCHER: You know, in the Middle East there is nothing new about one nation having a statement about another nation that people differ about. That's been the history of the region for forever. The United States' special role, though, is to play the part of bringing the parties together. And that's why the President is welcoming Ariel Sharon to the Oval Office today, and that's why he'll welcome King Abdullah here tomorrow, that's why he called President Mubarak of Egypt, et cetera. And that will be the role of the United States, to constantly engage in the diplomacy required to take nations that begin, at least, with a publicly stated strong stance, and try to move them together.
 Q: Can I follow up on a different subject, Ari? It has to do with the very strong accusation that the U.S. government made yesterday against Cuba. Under Secretary of State John Bolton basically said that the USA believes Cuba is developing biological weapons and transferring expertise to rogue nations. Is there any proof of this, or this an assumption of the United States?
 MR. FLEISCHER: No, it's not an assumption. I assure you that Secretary Bolton would not have said it if he did not have good cause, reason and fact to say it. That was based on sound analysis, and on information that is studied and available to the United States government.
 Q: But Cuba's been working with biomedical things for four decades. Is this something that has occurred lately, or does the U.S. believe this has been going on for years?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, as you know -- you've covered this region for a long time -- analysts and even Cuban defectors have long cast suspicion on the activities conducted in Cuban facilities and their biomedical research. And so I assure you, it would not have been said if it was not said for good basis.
 Q: Ari, two unrelated questions. First, there were these reports this morning that former President Clinton may get appointed to a group that's going out to East Timor. Can you tell you tell us about this? And is he under consideration, and why this --
 MR. FLEISCHER: There will be an event in East Timor that the United States will be sending a bipartisan delegation to attend. And it is not at the point yet where I can say something formal. Once it is a formal statement, I will be happy to issue it.
 Q: And you would expect that to be when?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Sometime soon. I'll just leave it at that.
 Q: So the answer is yes. (Laughter.)
 MR. FLEISCHER: Helen, you must be new in town.
 Q: You've learned. (Laughter.)
 Q: Back on the meeting with Prime Minister Sharon today. The Prime Minister, in his visits around town, has been talking about two different elements of his plan. One is working out physical partitions that would protect Israeli towns from suicide bombers. And the second, of course, is moving in much slower steps than you or Secretary Powell seem to have described before on the political track. Can you tell us what the President's position will be on each of those issues?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, two points. One, allow the meeting to take place and we'll see precisely what the Prime Minister says. But two, the President is going to adopt an approach to bringing peace to the Middle East by continuing these conversations directly with the principals and with the parties. And I do not expect that you will hear or see the President tick-tock each and every development, or try to negotiate events through the press.
 The President wants to continue to be a good ear to all the parties, so they know they can be welcome in the United States, and the United States will listen to what they have to say, and the United States will work its influence with all three parties to try to bridge gaps and bring people together. Sometimes the best way to bridge those gaps is to do so quietly and diplomatically, to listen, not prejudge. And that's what the President will do, that's his approach.
 And you know, again, there are going to be times, I think, where you will see, and you will know it, good success as a result of the President's quiet efforts. They're going to -- that was the case, of course, in the resolution of the situation in Ramallah. There are going to be other times where there are going to be setbacks, where it's going to be hard to bring the parties together. And that's, again, why the President knows that this process will be lengthy, but he will be dogged in trying to bring about successful results.
 Q: Ari, as the President tries to bring these sides together, though, he seems to have settled on a few things -- that there's a role for Arafat, there's a role for the Saudis, we need to keep the goal of a Palestinian state in mind and get there -- all of which Sharon doesn't seem to buy into. How does he -- what kind of leverage does he have to try to bring the Prime Minister to his point of view? And will that be one of the purposes of today's meeting?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, again, that is the essence of diplomacy. But I think if you had said, as some did shortly after the President's speech in the Rose Garden April 4th, that the Israelis say they won't withdraw -- and, of course, after time, after the diligence and the pursuit by the President, a satisfactory result was concluded to Israel's operation in the withdrawal. From the President's point of view, they did listen.
 So not everything in the Middle East moves at the speed of press deadlines. But it will continue to move at the speed of the partners for peace that the President is seeking to assemble as he tries to bring the parties together.
 Q: Following on that, the President is totally satisfied that Sharon met his request for -- I forget the exact words, as soon as possible?
 MR. FLEISCHER: What I was referring to is that -- if you recall, right after the President's speech on April 4th, we were in Crawford, and I said what's going to happen next is the parties are going to take time, the nations are going to take time to digest what the President said in his remarks. And that is the nature of the Middle East. There are going to be a series of events that take place that each nation and the various parties are going to weigh carefully, listen to. I suspect you'll hear some things in public that the nations may not say in private. And that is all part of the process of trying to quietly bring people together in the Middle East. And that's going to be the ongoing efforts by the President.
 So the President's message to Israel has been and will continue to be that Israel needs to focus on a broader vision of how to create an environment for an Israel and a Palestine to live side by side. The President believes it is entirely in the interest of the Israeli people to create that environment so the Palestinian people can have a state that is free from corruption, that's based on the rule of law, that develops where Israel does not have to only worry about security, but Israel, like Israel has done with Egypt and with Jordan, can develop into a peaceful relationship with neighbors, where there used to be hostility.
 Q: Ari, does this action that you announced today about Iraq address in any way the reported use of stealth, under the table surcharges that Iraq's been putting on its oil exports to get around the earlier sanctions and the earlier restrictions on where any oil profits could go?
 MR. FLEISCHER: You may want to take a look at the exact text of what is being passed out at the United Nations. And the purpose of this -- and there's a whole list of goods that will be permissible -- and the whole purpose of this is to address what's been one of the greatest weaknesses in the sanctions policy, which is it was not being followed.
 The President believes it is far, far better for the world to know that there are certain products that absolutely will not be allowed to go into Iraq because they can be used for military purposes or for the purposes of developing weapons of mass destruction; while there will be other goods that can and should go into Iraq to help the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people.
 The previous sanction policy was not effective because it was so riddled with loopholes. And as a practical matter, that, as the President said repeatedly, was really a sanctions policy that resembled Swiss cheese. And this is a successful result of the United States' efforts that have been long going at the United Nations. If you recall, some six months ago, we were very close to getting this done. Now we've worked very closely with the Perm 5, and Russia, again, has played a very constructive role in helping to reach an agreement at the United Nations.
 Q: To what extent is this sort of a run-up to tightening diplomatic and military sanctions, if you will --
 MR. FLEISCHER: I think you have to look at this as an event in and of itself. This is something that gets reauthorized every six months by the United States. The reason the U.N. set this as a six-month renewal is so they could always come back and look at this in and of itself, to make sure that it was working, and if not, to make adjustments. They are now making these adjustments.
 Q: Before we get back to the Middle East, I want to ask you a quick question about the supplemental, if I may. Already the House, with the leadership of Chairman Young, is talking about $3 billion more than the President was talking about. It hasn't even gotten to the Senate side yet, where it's sure to have many more billions added to it. What is the administration's current thinking about how large a supplemental it can accept?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, the House Appropriations Committee has not yet marked it up. The administration is reviewing it carefully. And we'll be taking a look at obviously the line items within the supplemental appropriation bill, as well as the aggregate spending figure. The President's message to the Congress is to hold the line on spending. We are a nation that has a deficit. And it's important for Congress not to add excessive spending to make the deficit worse. There are legitimate defense needs that have to be addressed that the President proposed funding for; homeland security needs, as well. And so we will be taking a very careful look. And stay in touch, is what I can tell you for now.
 Q: I wanted to shift to the Middle East. I'm not quite clear how the administration envisions this process --
 MR. FLEISCHER: Is this a follow-up to your previous question?
 Q: Correct. I indicated at the outset that I wanted to insert that before we got to the Middle East.
 MR. FLEISCHER: Is this a related follow-up, or an unrelated follow-up? (Laughter.)
 Q: It's an unrelated follow-up.
 Q: The best kind. (Laughter.)
 Q: The administration -- it's not quite clear to me what the administration -- how it envisions the process going forward. There's a lot of discussion about whether or not the idea of a complete peace agreement should be on the table as an incentive for Palestinians to look forward to something other than a constant battle with the Israelis. How does the administration view the process from here on out? Do we need a new peace agreement on the table quickly in order to create an incentive for the Palestinians?
 MR. FLEISCHER: All of this is going to be discussed in a series of meetings and phone calls that the President is having. There are a variety of different approaches, and the President wants to listen carefully to various people's ideas about how to move forward. And as he moves forward on what I describe as his path to peace that has multiple avenues to it, the President will continue to listen carefully to people's ideas.
 And one area, again, that I strongly urge you to keep your focus on is, in addition to what has traditionally been done involving the direct talks with the parties, one interesting development that has been present since January 20, 2001 is the constant work that the President has done and his diplomats have done with other nations in the region, as well as Europe and others. There is a view that to create the environment for peace in the Middle East, there is a role that others can play to help the parties to enter into political talks and political dialogue.
 Make no mistake, the President believes that to bring peace to the region, there has to be a focus on the political process, so that we can go beyond security, while making sure that Israel has its security needs addressed, because it would be much harder to do without security needs being addressed, but a real return to a focus on political events, political settlements -- the speed of which will be determined in good part by the willingness of the participants to move with the President.
 Q: One of the things, though, that's not quite clear is you're talking about democracy, anti-corruption, that sort of thing among a new Palestinian Authority. How does the administration envision that happening? Are you -- do you see new elections among the Palestinians? Are you going to --
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, first and foremost, it will come from the Palestinian people. I think there's no question that prior to the recent surge in the violence, Yasser Arafat was under a lot of pressure from Palestinian people to end the corruption. There was a tremendous amount of dissatisfaction by the Palestinian people, with corruption within the Palestinian Authority, with money that should have been given to the Palestinian people that ended up abroad. As a result of the violence, that focus of the Palestinian people shifted onto matters of security, and therefore that issue has subsided.
 What the President is focused on now is reconstruction, a way to help the Palestinian institutions be recreated so that people again focus on what is natural in life. And what is natural in life is economic opportunity, is education for children. It is not violence. And as the violence fades, there will be a gradual shift back to the Palestinian people asking what type of government will represent us as we try to educate our children, as we try to have jobs and economic opportunity?
 Israel plays a role in that, as the President has talked about, at the checkpoints, making sure that the Palestinian people have opportunities for economic advancement. That, too, will be made easier when violence subsists, because, therefore, Israel will be more willing to allow people to come through the checkpoints.
 So the President's focus is on the rebuilding of the Palestinian infrastructure in a way that the Palestinian people can have a Palestinian
 Authority that is worthy of their goals. And those goals will be easier achieved if the Palestinian Authority focuses on rule of law and a fight against corruption.
 Q: I have a question on Kyoto and then a follow-up on something you just said. Now that the administration has renounced this International Criminal Court, there are reports that the U.S. might de-sign or actually pull out of Kyoto, which it hasn't done formally yet. Any comments on Kyoto?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, first of all, just on the language, to be specific, on the International Criminal Court, it is not a de-signing. That's a legal matter. It has the effect of withdrawing the United States from any participation. And on that point, too, I just want to bring to your attention a document that was submitted with the signature of President Clinton on December 31, 2000, in which President Clinton himself, on the ICC, referred to it as a treaty with significant flaws. And he went on to state, ""The United States should have the chance to observe and assess the function of the court over time, before choosing to become subject to its jurisdiction. Given these concerns, I will not and do not recommend that my successor submit the treaty to the Senate for advice and consent until our fundamental concerns are satisfied.""
 So that treaty had been signed by President Clinton, as he called it, with significant flaws. And he urged his successor not to submit it. And I have heard nothing new on Kyoto. I think that matter has been dealt with. The President has already announced what he views as an alternative to Kyoto that will help reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
 Q: On another matter, FERC released some documents yesterday suggesting that Enron manipulated electricity prices during California's energy crisis last year. Has the administration rethought its attitude toward deregulation in light of these revelations?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, I'm glad you asked that, because it does cast a light on something very interesting and very important in terms of the administration's ongoing commitment to take action if there is any wrongdoing in market manipulation. And last May, the President called on FERC to be vigilant in protecting consumers. And we've always said that if anybody is illegally manipulating markets, they need to be held accountable.
 And these documents, which as you accurately point out, were released by FERC, an independent agency of this government, were released as part of an ongoing investigation launched by this administration through FERC, which has been something that the President has noted and he expects the investigation will be vigorously pursued, wherever it may go.
 As a general matter, the administration supports very tough enforcement of the laws that protect consumers, and that applies to the energy markets, as well. If you take a look at the legislation that is pending on the Hill in the energy bill and what we submitted to the Congress, the legislation the President proposed asked Congress to enact tougher penalties to prevent market manipulation. And many of these provisions, I'm pleased to note, are in the Senate bill.
 Let me give you some specificity to that. We have proposed to the Congress that they increase criminal penalties for violating -- if anybody's found to have violated the Federal Power Act, that the penalties be increased from $5,000 to $1 million; and in some cases, from $500 per day to $25,000; and that prison terms be increased from two years to five years. Those are all items that we had proposed that we will fight for in the conference that is now pending up on the Hill. We have asked to make sure that FERC has the authority it needs to go after -- to do its job. It's also important to prevent the opportunity for market manipulation by modernizing and expanding the electricity grid, and encouraging investment in new, clean generation. These issues are pending before the Congress now, and the administration will continue to work that issue. It raises important issues.
 Q: Do you support Senator Feinstein's call for a criminal investigation of Enron?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Anytime any individual asks the White House to make a comment about taking a stand on a specific criminal matter, the White House is not the proper agency to make determinations about who should and who should not be criminally prosecuted. Those issues, I think the American people recognize, belong in the hands of the professional prosecutors. It is their judgment to make that. I note to your attention that FERC is investigating.
 I'm going to keep moving around. People haven't had it yet. You've had one before?
 Q: David asked it.
 MR. FLEISCHER: Okay. Mark?
 Q: Thank you, Ari. King Abdullah's role. It seemed that when President Clinton found the Mideast peace negotiations at an emotional and difficult spot, he'd tend to bring in King Hussein. Do you see Abdullah playing a similar sort of go-to role in this process?
 MR. FLEISCHER: This is why I drew your attention to the fact that the President has called 55 Arab heads of state since he became President -- 54; it will be 55 this afternoon. This has been an ongoing part of the President's diplomacy. The President recognized from the very beginning that there is a role to play for the other nations in the region. Clearly, that includes Jordan.
 Jordan has a peace treaty with Israel. Jordan has been a very helpful influence in the region. There is a role for Jordan to play. And there's also a role for Egypt to play. They have played a leadership role. Saudi Arabia, interestingly now, with the role that they played just a few weeks ago and continue to play; Morocco. There are a number of nations that have been helpful and productive. And the President remains and will remain in close touch with them, as well as Secretary Powell doing his hard work, too.
 Q: Ari, you said before that we had raised with the Saudis questions about this support for suicide bombers, they'd given assurances and we had accepted those assurances. Does that mean that you do not believe the material the Israelis presented proves anything, or could that change our belief in the Saudi assurances?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Again, I just refer you to what the Secretary said. And we have received those assurances directly from Saudi leaders at the highest levels.
 Q: Can I just follow on that?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Campbell, we have an order. You were called on earlier.
 Q: Another question related to the Saudis. You've been stressing today the need for the Palestinian Authority to have a democratic, open rule, respect of human rights. Saudi Arabia is not a democracy, does not have human rights, doesn't even let women drive. Do the same standards that apply to the Palestinian Authority now also apply to Saudi Arabia?
 MR. FLEISCHER: The President made clear in his State of the Union address the important need around the world, no matter where in the world, for values that represent the best path to peace, as well as for fundamental fulfillment of individual rights that are eternal human values to be implemented throughout the world, and that includes Saudi Arabia.
 Q: In all of the hours that General Zinni and Secretary Powell have spent talking with Yasser Arafat, they surely must have mentioned Osama bin Laden and our deep concern about him. And if Arafat ever, in any way admitted that bin Laden is a terrorist, that would have been very good news that you would surely have told us about, Ari. And my question is, but the fact is that Arafat has never admitted that bin Laden is a terrorist. Isn't that true, Ari? Or can you, from your remarkable memory, cite any time where he has admitted that Osama bin Laden is a terrorist?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Lester, I do not chronicle every statement made by Yasser Arafat to tell you whether he did or didn't. But the point is, the President has said Yasser Arafat has not earned his trust, that Yasser Arafat has not done enough to fight terrorism and to crack down on corruption. And that's the more important question for President Bush.
 Q: Wait a minute, I had my follow-up. Does the President believe that our airline pilots should not be allowed to carry any sidearms?
 MR. FLEISCHER: No change in the President's position.
 Q: What is the President's position? He believes --
 MR. FLEISCHER: The President has listened to his security experts and aviation experts who have come to the conclusion that they should not.
 Q: I just wanted to clarify what you said earlier to Deb's question. On the Saudi question, you keep referring us back to the Secretary's comments. But this morning he said that the President hadn't yet seen the documents, that he was going to look them over.
 MR. FLEISCHER: That's true, as well.
 Q: So he still hasn't seen the documents?
 MR. FLEISCHER: No, I presume that they will be brought with the Israeli delegation. The President himself has not seen them.
 Q: This morning you said that you would looked them over, and then at that point make a decision as to whether you needed to raise any additional concerns with the Saudis. Does that still hold?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Yes, it does.
 Q: Because what Powell was saying was, everything is fine, we take them at their word.
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, we can take a look at the documents and see, as I indicated this morning, if there is anything that we need to raise with Saudi officials.
 Q: A quick follow-up on the Middle East issue. On April 4th in his Rose Garden statement, the President called on Prime Minister Sharon to cease the construction of settlements. How important is that issue in the near-term to the President's search for peace? And what does he expect of Ariel Sharon, who said he doesn't intend to do that?
 MR. FLEISCHER: That's one of many important issues. And it's something that both Secretary Powell and Dr. Rice addressed when they said that this is something that we will be talking to the Israeli government about. We already have had conversations under the Mitchell plan, as you know, that did call for an end to settlement policy. It is one of the issues that has to be addressed as part of what I referred to earlier, as the political dialogue -- the discussion and a resolution of border issues, a discussion and resolution of checkpoint issues, a discussion and resolution of settlement issues. All of those are part and parcel of the political talks that are going to be the key to getting real, lasting progress done.
 Q: How does the President intend to develop a reconstruction program for the Palestinians? And secondly, with all the listening and talking, the initiatives that are going on for peace in the region, is Mitchell and Tenet and all that off the table now, or are they still part of the process?
 MR. FLEISCHER: No, they're still part of the process. And again, take the words of Tenet and Mitchell out of it. Tenet equals security, Mitchell equals political process, political talks. Those are two fundamental pillars to achieving peace in the Middle East. You have to have both. And so they both apply, just as much as before.
 Q: Okay, then the Palestinian aid, is there a plan yet in mind for developing a program?
 MR. FLEISCHER: The United States provides, with the recent $30 million increase in aid for the Palestinian people, the United States now provides $110 million annually for the Palestinian people, as well as the support the United States gave to the Oslo Conference some three weeks ago, which also has provided a humanitarian effort worldwide to bring aid to the Palestinian people.
 Q: No new conference or --
 MR. FLEISCHER: I think these are all parts of the ongoing discussions. The President talked to President Mubarak about it today, for example. And I assure you that the levels -- appropriate levels at the State Department and other agencies of the government, that's where it's being worked out.
 Q: Ari, as part of the interim steps that Israel would like to propose to the White House, one of them is to grant Palestinians a state over areas that they already control, pushing down the road the thornier issue about where do you draw the final status border. In the President's vision of what a Palestinian state looks like, does he believe it could start small and expand?
 MR. FLEISCHER: John, this is where I indicated earlier, I'm just not going to tick-tock or give the play-by-play on everybody's initiative and every specific level of how to bring peace to the region. What the President wants to do is create an environment where different people can bring their ideas forward, and then quietly bring people together around the ideas that lead to peace. And, unfortunately, when it comes to diplomacy, one of the best ways to do that sometimes is quietly. That's the best way to be effective. So you're not going to hear the President give a thumbs-up/thumbs-down to each and every specific proposal that anybody makes. He's going to continue to play America's unique role, which is to bring people together around the principles that the President has outlined.
 Q: When he talks about a Palestinian state, what's he talking about?
 MR. FLEISCHER: He's talking about a Palestinian state whose precise borders and the timing of which it would be created would be determined in negotiation with the principals in the area.
 Q: Ari, does the President still have confidence in Army Secretary White? At issue is whether the Army engaged in misconduct, lobbying Congress to maintain funding for this weapons program --
 MR. FLEISCHER: The President -- yes, the President has confidence in Army Secretary White. He thinks he's doing a good job at his post.
 Q: So he's ruled that the Army Secretary did not engage in any misconduct when it comes to lobbying for this weapons program?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, the President makes no such rulings. But that's something that the Inspector General of the Department of Defense is taking a look at. But that's the answer to your question.
 Q: You were really telling us today that a nuclear treaty, nuclear reduction treaty is going to be signed in Moscow, weren't you, really? Has it a new momentum that suddenly it's --
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, as you remember when Foreign Minister Ivanov was here and the President and the Foreign Minister discussed the prospects, how the President said at that time he was hopeful we could get an agreement. There's been ongoing continued diplomacy.
 This is another area where the President really worked very hard and quietly with President Putin directly -- with President Putin directly to achieve a reduction in our offensive weapons to between 1,700 and 2,200 weapons, and then to codify the agreement. And the President always hoped he'd be able to codify it during his visit to Russia. That's something the President has said. And he, as well as the experts in the State Department, have worked very diligently behind the scenes to make that a reality. But the President still is hopeful it will happen. But as he discussed with President Putin this morning, good progress continues. And that's an encouraging sign. That will be a significant development.
 Thank you.

George W. Bush,"May 24, 2002",Remarks to Community and Religious Leaders in Moscow,"Thank you all very much. Mr. Ambassador, thank you and Lisa for opening up your modest home. [Laughter] I bet every Ambassador that represents the United States wishes they lived this way. But we appreciate your taking on this very important assignment, and that is to represent our country here in Russia.
I'm honored that Laura was traveling with me today. Trips always seem to go so much better when she is by my side, so I'm really glad you got to meet Laura. I like to tell the story in America that when I married her, she was a public school librarian who didn't like politics and didn't particularly care for politicians. [Laughter] And then she got stuck marrying one. [Laughter] But she's doing a great job for our country, and I'm real proud of her.
And I'm proud of the team I put together as well. I've got a great national security team, headed by Colin Powell and by Condi Rice and Andy Card. And I'm honored they're traveling with me, and I'm honored you have a chance to meet them as well.
And thank you all for coming. For those of us, the Spaso House—at least those of us who've paid attention to international politics—the Spaso House was always viewed as a refuge for freedom. And I'm so privileged to give you a few comments here in this historic setting, where so much history was written.
You know, I'm aware that during World War II, Russian, American diplomats and soldiers met here as allies. It's kind of an interesting part of the history of this house. And during the cold war, this is where many of you came, refuseniks and human rights activists. You're always welcome here, and we're glad you're here.
Our Nation stands for freedom. That's what we're fighting off the terrorists about. We believe so strongly in freedom, we're willing to defend it at all costs. The Soviet era is gone. The cold war, I hope, is past us. And today President Putin and I signed an historic document. It was more than just a document that reduces nuclear weaponry, although that in itself is good. It's a document that says there's a new era ahead of us, that instead of being stuck in the past, these two leaders are willing to take two great countries forward in a new relationship built on common interests and cooperation, and cooperation on all fronts—the idea of working together to make the Russian economy strong and vibrant so people can make a living, so people have hope about putting bread on the table for their families; the cooperation of fighting terror; the cooperation of promoting peace. But the best cooperation also must be based on common values, as well as common interests.
And I want you to know that we hold the values in America dear, and you know that. We hold dear what our Declaration of Independence says, that all have got uninalienable rights, endowed by a Creator—not endowed by the ones who wrote the Declaration of Independence but by a Creator, a universal Creator. I want you to know that I believe all governments have a duty and responsibility to protect those rights, those unalienable rights.
In Soviet times, people heroically defended those rights with incredible courage, and you earned the respect of a lot of people—a lot of people—by doing so. Many of you now are active in a modern Russia, and I want to thank you for staying active and involved in this important society, starting with making sure that freedom is protected by rule of law. And we agree completely, and we hope we can help, because rule of law is essential for a modern society to thrive and to succeed.
I applaud your commitment and your patriotism. I love the fact that you love your country. I love mine, and you love yours, and that's incredibly healthy and important. You understand that free nations and a free Russia require strong civic and religious institutions, committed to democratic values.
Russia's on the road to democracy, but it's important, as she does so, that she embrace the values inherent in democracy. In the past, I know you know that we have been committed to helping institutions which promote those values through direct Government assistance, and we will continue to do so. We believe it's for the good of Russia. We believe it will help Russia develop in a way that will be—enable Russia to become a lasting friend. And that's what I'm interested in. I'm interested in friendship and peace and mutual development.
Most Russians want and expect what most Americans want and expect, and that's important for the Russian people and the American people to understand, a Government—starting with a Government that works for citizens, that represents everyday citizens, not a corrupt elite. And that's important.
People want a society ruled by law, not by special privilege, special circumstance; a law where people are treated equally, regardless of their religion, ethnicity, income level. In a multiethnic society, people must work toward tolerance and reject extremism. It's important in America, just like it's important here in Russia. And this is a multiethnic society, to the credit of Russia, just like America is a multiethnic society, which makes our country strong. We're bound together by common values. And so can Russia be bound by the same values.
To reach these goals, societies need fair laws and, as importantly, fair enforcement of law. They need independent media that is respected by the Government. I remind those who sometimes get frustrated with the media that even in America, elected officials sometimes don't agree what's written about them—maybe especially America, for all I know. [Laughter] But it's important for those of us who value democracy to promote an independent media.
Opposition parties must be free to associate and must be free to speak their minds. In order for a democracy to be strong, there has to be competition of ideas, a free discussion of ideas, and an airing of philosophy in an open way. Freedom of religion and separation of church and state are so important, so important so that people can worship as they choose, Jews, Muslims, and all Christians, and all religions.
Free societies have all got to meet the great challenges we face in ways consistent with values. That's what I'm here to tell you that's in my heart. That's what I want you to know about this administration, that we're not only committed to fighting terrorism—and we will. We are. We were under attack in America.
In Germany yesterday I said, September the 11th was just a fine—just as clear a dividing line in our history, in our Nation's history, as Pearl Harbor. It was. America at one time was protected by two oceans— we seemed totally invulnerable to, for example, the wars that took place here in Russia or on the European Continent—and all of a sudden found ourselves attacked, because we love freedom, because we respect religion, because we honor discourse. And you need to know that we're going to defend ourselves and defend that which we hold dear and, at the same time, protect civilization itself.
But in Afghanistan, we've shown, I believe, how to do it in a way that's commiserate with our values—that, on the one hand, we're plenty tough, and we will be. We've got a military we're going to use, if we need to, to defend freedom. But on the other hand, we delivered a lot of medicine and a lot of food. We hurt thinking not only that the children in Afghanistan could not go to school; we cried for the fact that people were starving in the country. We have rebuilt schools. We have also provided medicine and food.
Russia is building hospitals in Afghanistan. That's incredibly positive, we think. Nations are not only contributing military forces, but we're working to build a state that can function on her own, a state at peace in the neighborhood, and a state where people have got hope and a chance to survive, where moms and dads can raise their children in peace.
And that's important for you to know as well. You know, a lot of the time, people talk about the tough talk. But you've got to understand, we also have got a soft heart when it comes to the human condition. Each individual matters to me. Each individual has got worth and dignity.
The experience in Afghanistan has taught us all that there's lessons to be learned about how to protect one's homeland and, at the same time, be respectful of the— on the battlefield. And that lesson applies to Chechnya. The war on terror can be won, and at the same time, we have proven it's possible to respect the rights of the people in the territories, to respect the rights of the minorities.
We are—I represent a great nation, and Russia is a great nation. Both of us share a lot. We've got a big resource base. We've got people who are very smart. I remind Vladimir Putin that the great resource of Russia is the people of Russia. The resource of this country is the brainpower of this country. And when they get the system right, that encourages individual growth and entrepreneurship; that brainpower is going to flourish, and so will commerce, and so will opportunity. And while that happens, both nations must respect the multiethnic character of our lands. That, too, makes us great. And how we promote that multiethnicity, and how we respect human rights is another way we'll be judged by history.
We'll be judged by history on how we defend our freedoms. We'll be judged in history by how we help our people prosper and grow. And we'll be judged by history as to whether or not we defend the universal values that are right and just and true.
I want to thank you for that commitment to those values. I appreciate your stance for freedom. I appreciate your love of your country. I appreciate your understanding there is a universal and gracious God.
May God bless you all. May God bless Russia. And may God bless the United States. Thank you very much.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-community-and-religious-leaders-moscow
George W. Bush,"May 24, 2002",The President's News Conference With President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in Moscow,"President Bush. President Putin, thank you very much. Laura and I are so grateful for your hospitality and your friendship. It's an historic and hopeful day for Russia and America. It's an historic day for the world as well.
President Putin and I today ended a long chapter of confrontation and opened up an entirely new relationship between our countries. Mr. President, I appreciate your leadership. I appreciate your vision. I appreciate the fact that we've now laid the foundation for not only our governments but future governments to work in a spirit of cooperation and a spirit of trust. That's good. It's good for the people of Russia; it's good for the people of the United States.
President Putin and I have signed a treaty that will substantially reduce our nuclear—strategic nuclear warhead arsenals to the range of 1,700 to 2,200, the lowest level in decades. This treaty liquidates the cold war legacy of nuclear hostility between our countries.
We've also signed a joint declaration of new strategic relationship that charts a course toward greater security, political, and economic cooperation between Russia and the United States. Our nations will continue to cooperate closely in the war against global terror. I understand full well that the people of Russia have suffered at the hands of terrorists, and so have we. And I want to thank President Putin for his understanding of the nature of the new war we face together and his willingness to be determined and steadfast and patient as we pursue this war together.
President Putin and I agree also that the greatest danger in this war is the prospect of terrorists acquiring weapons of mass destruction. Our nations must spare no effort at preventing all forms of proliferation. And we discussed Iran in this context today. We'll work closely with each other on this very important issue.
Our nations also agree on the importance of a new NATO-Russia Council that will be launched in a few days in Rome. And Mr. President, this council is also a tribute to your leadership and your vision. For decades, Russia and NATO were adversaries. Those days are gone, and that's good. And that's good for the Russian people; it's good for the people of my country; it's good for the people of Europe; and it's good for the people of the world.
Russia and the United States are also determined to work closely on important regional challenges. Together, we will work to rebuild Afghanistan. Together, we will work to improve security in Georgia. We will work to help end fighting and achieve a political settlement in Chechnya.
Russia and the United States are committed to economic cooperation. We have launched a major new energy partnership. Private firms will take the lead in developing and transforming the vast energy reserves of Russia and the Caspian world to markets through multiple pipelines such as the Caspian Pipeline Consortium and Baku-Jihan. And I want to thank you for the cooperation and the willingness to work together on energy and energy security.
Russia is building its market economy, opening new opportunities for both our countries. I'm impressed by the level of entrepreneurial growth here in Russia. It's a significant achievement. Again, it's a testimony to the leadership of Vladimir Putin.
In a while, we're going to meet with Russian and American business leaders to discuss how we can continue fostering good relations and fostering opportunity. We want Russia to be a part of the world economy. We look forward to one day welcoming Russia as a member of the World Trade Organization. President Putin and I also agree that we'll work to resolve disputed areas of trading, such as poultry or steel, in a spirit of mutual respect and trust.
America welcomes the dramatic improvement in freedoms in Russia since Soviet days, including the new freedoms of Russia's Jewish community. In recognition of these freedoms, I am determined to work with Congress to remove Russia from the Jackson-Vanik amendment. It is time our Congress responded to my request, President Putin's desire, that the Jackson-Vanik amendment be removed pertaining to Russia.
I also discussed with President Putin the important role of free press in building a working democracy. And today we will meet with media entrepreneurs from both countries. It's an issue we discussed before. The President said it makes sense to have a forum where media entrepreneurs can meet and visit. And it's going to take place today. Mr. President, I appreciate that.
I am pleased with our relationship. I am confident that, by working together, we make the world more peaceful. I'm confident that, by working together, we can win the first war of the 21st century, and that is the war coldblooded killers—against coldblooded killers who want to harm nations such as America and Russia. And I'm confident that, when we work together in a spirit of cooperation on all fronts, both our peoples will benefit.
Mr. President, thank you for your hospitality.
President Putin. Distinguished American colleagues, distinguished Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, we've just accomplished the official part of our talks with U.S. President George Bush. Before our distinguished colleagues are the visit in Moscow and in St. Petersburg. But now we can name the major result of our talks—first of all, the logical development and practical implementation as seen by our agreements reached in Crawford last year. I mean the signature of the treaty between Russia on strategic defensive reductions and, first of all, this document.
It's the statement of our countries to reduce our nuclear arsenals and the joint work for nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. It's the decision of two states which are particularly responsible for international security and strategic stability. We're on the level of adopting the declaration on new strategic relationship which determines the basic directions in the security and international policy. It will have a positive impact for economic cooperation and development of our relations between the institutions of general public. And together with Mr. President, we discussed especially this aspect, the civil society between the people of our countries. The declaration formulates the principles of our dialog, anti-missile dialog; that is, the transparency and openness and exclusion of potential threats. We confirmed the Genoa agreement on offensive and defensive systems in all their aspects.
A separate issue, the mechanism of NATO-Russia cooperation within the framework of 20, it presumes a new level of joint responsibility and confidence between all its participants. I would like to stress, especially, that is the international novelty. And it happened because of the strengthening of Russian-American relations, including in joint confrontation to international terrorists—struggling with international terrorism. Russians work together with the American people in September the 8th, and we're grateful for sincere feelings of compassion headed by President Bush on behalf of American people because of the recent events in Kaspiysk. The memory of terrorism victims and the responsibility for the security of our people means joint struggle against this evil, as well as the struggle against nazism. The spirit of our cooperation will mean fruitful results even today.
That's why the agenda has very concrete issues of interaction against terrorism on the basis of unique standards against any manifestation of terrorism and extremism. We need close contacts through all agencies and services, including special services. Here we have very positive experience we've accrued over the past years. And we see today—we feel it today during the negotiations. The bilateral working group on Afghanistan has demonstrated its efficiency. And we, Mr. President, would like to transform it on a group to combat terrorism, especially chemical, biological, nuclear terrorism.
Russia and the United States are oriented to build new relations in economic activity. Our businessman mentality is much alike, that their qualities and their joint work is based on free trade and supporting the initiatives. That's why our task is to open new opportunities for business community.
We need to avoid obstacles of the past. Here we mean not only the market status of the Russian economy—and I'm grateful to Mr. President that he has given a very positive signal during our talks. And it does also mean such things as Jackson-Vanik amendment. We have to remove administrative obstacles, which encurls both countries, to cooperate, especially in the high-tech sphere, which determined the economy of the 21st century; that is, the aeronautics, telecommunications, science and technologies, new sources of energy. I would like to focus on energy, especially nuclear energy. We paid much attention to it today. And the large format of our cooperation will be a great element for the global economy on the whole.
I would like to stress, in conclusion, that, of course, not all ideas, not all initiatives, are on paper and in the form of official documents. But a serious move forward in all these issues is quite evident for us. Today, we together counteract global threats and challenges, and we're going to form a stable world order that is within the interests of our peoples and our countries. And I think it's in the interest of all the civilized human society.
Thank you.
President Bush. Name your agency.
Nuclear Arms Reductions
Q. I have a question for both Presidents, please. If we've truly entered a new era, why do you each need 1,700 nuclear weapons? And President Putin, why does Russia need to continue producing nuclear warheads? And to President Bush, why does the United States need to keep some 2,000 of these weapons in storage, ready for deployment?
President Bush. Yes. First of all, remember where we've come from. We've come from 6,000 to 1,700 in a very quick—or to 1,700 to 2,200 in a very quick period of time. You know, friends really don't need weapons pointed at each other. We both understand that. But it's a realistic assessment of where we've been. And who knows what will happen 10 years from now? Who knows what future Presidents will say and how they react?
If you have a nuclear arsenal, you want to make sure they work. It's—one reason that you keep weapons in storage apart from launchers is for quality control. And the thing I think it's important for you to know, Ron [Ron Fournier, Associated Press], is that we've made tremendous progress from the past. And the treaty is setting a period of time in the rear-view mirror of both countries. And I am not only confident that this is good for world peace; I'm confident this sets the stage for incredible cooperation that we've never had before between our countries.
President Putin. I concur with the assessment given by my colleague, Mr. Bush. And naturally, our position is well known. We are guided by the facts that it's more worthwhile, perhaps, to eliminate a certain part of nuclear potentials. At the same time, I'd like to point out another thing here. Any man who has at least once in his career dealt with arms, had arms in his hands, at least to hunt or a rifle or whatever, he knows that it's much better, much safer to have it in stock disarmed, disassembled perhaps, rather than to have it in your arms and charged with bullets in it and with your finger on the trigger at the same time. This is a different state of affairs, as it were.
And the fact that we agreed with President Bush regarding such détente, in such manner, this is a serious move ahead to ensure international security, which is a very good sign as regards the relationship between our two countries.
Now, as to why Russia should continue to produce nuclear arms, I'd like to say that this is not our priority. But in addition to Russia and U.S. out there, there are other states who possess nuclear arms. What is more concerning, there are countries who want to acquire weapons of mass destruction. Experts in the area of international security are aware of the fact, and they have been talking a lot about nuclear arms as deterrent.
Moreover, many of them assert—and it is difficult to dispute this fact—they say the existence of the nuclear arms was an impediment, an obstacle which contained the world from large-scale wars over the past decades, let's say. And I think we should take that into consideration while building a new quality of relationship within the two main nuclear states of the world.
We also should pay attention to the whole set of relations currently in the world out there, and we should take into account the prospects of development of the world in the realm of security, bearing in mind those potential threats I've mentioned here.
Jackson-Vanik Amendment/Russia-U.S. Economic Relationship
Q. Mr. Bush, when we can hope that Jackson-Vanik will be rescinded, which currently is very out of place? That's, you know, a remnant of the cold war here. And will the U.S. continue to use it as a leverage of applying pressure on Russia and when Russia will finally be recognized as a marketplace country? And what's the prospect of Russia's accession to WTO?
And now to Mr. Putin, Russian President. What's your idea of how U.S. Boeings can help Russian civil aviation?
President Bush. I couldn't make myself clearer during my opening statement about how I feel about Jackson-Vanik—not much action by the Congress of the United States, and I hope they act. The market-based economy is an issue that the President and I talked about. It is a regulatory matter, the responsibility of which resides at the Commerce Department. Secretary Evans and I have to talk about this subject, and we'll have an answer to the President soon.
And in terms of success of Russia ascending into the WTO, it's something that we want. It's in our Nation's interest that Russia be a part of the WTO. And we look forward to working with the President and respective ministers to see that that happens. It's in our interest that that happen. So it's hard for me to predict the timetables on all the issues you mentioned. Those over which I have got direct control will happen relatively quickly.
President Putin. Well, you know, while talking about the whole set of commercial and trade ties between our two countries, today we've mentioned more than once that we are facing somewhat an unusual situation in this area today, which has to do with the fact that while improving relations in disarmament matters, building confidence and so on and so forth, at the same time, we're expanding the whole set of relations in economic area. And naturally, we'll face new problems we never had to deal with before.
The position taken by the U.S. administration and the President is known to us as regards Jackson-Vanik. It's precisely the administration who initiated its rescinding. And business communities of our two countries, American and Russian business communities, and their interaction together with the interaction of the parliamentary issues, will be able to remove similar problems in automatic manner, I guess.
Now, as regards your specific question on purchase of Boeings, I must say that the best lobbyist of the interests of U.S. companies will be American President standing here, since both Boeings and poultry and other matters very often have been told by my colleagues. People usually say, ""Well, it's not on our level, but I must say,"" and then there will be a lengthy monolog on specific matters.
Anyhow, you've posed a very acute and very specific question. Why it's acute?— Because it's on the agenda—or practical interaction. And it's very specific since it has a bearing to very specific matters. And since it's acute and specific, I'll answer as one should in gentlemen's society, in a very general manner.
First and foremost, our carriers, in my opinion, should be primarily guided towards Russian aircraft producers. Why?—because Russian manufacturers, you know, don't have anywhere to sell their products otherwise, because they are not let anywhere— or with a lot of difficulty. They only can sell it domestically; that's the first thing. And here we can talk about interaction on the market.
Now, the second thing, our carriers, primarily Aeroflot, should be competitive on the market and should have advanced technology in their hands. Therefore, they both have American Boeings today; they also have European Airbus aircraft. And the question has been raised currently on additional purchase, on replacement of old equipment with those foreign aircraft.
Now, I should say, depending on the decision to be taken by economic structures— this is not a political question, mind you. The economic structure should decide on it. A lot will depend on it in regards of the state of our political interaction, of course. And our American colleagues' proposal today is a little bit costlier than the Europeans' proposal. Had Americans bought our cheap aluminum and steel, then their aircraft would have been cheaper and more competitive, including in our market.
So all of this jointly has been a subject of our discussions with the President here, and our good friend and partner, Secretary of Commerce and economy. And I think that in the course of normalization of trade and commerce relations, all these issues will be addressed in a most mutually advantageous manner.
Iran/Nuclear Nonproliferation
Q. [Inaudible]—state sponsor of terrorism. I wonder because of that, if these Russians sales that you object to continue, does that—this new strategic relationship you're discussing today bump up against what you outlined in your speech to Congress when you said, in the war against terrorism, you're either with the United States or against the United States?
And President Putin, the Bush team says that your sales of nuclear technology and sophisticated military technology to Iran are the world's single biggest proliferation problem right now. Do you agree with that assessment, and did you make any specific promises today in your meeting with President Bush?
President Bush. Well, first, we spent a lot of time on this subject. And as I said yesterday in Germany, I worry about Iran. And I'm confident Vladimir Putin worries about Iran, and that was confirmed today. He understands terrorist threats, just like we understand terrorist threats. And he understands that weapons of mass destruction are dangerous to Russia, just as they are to America. And he's explained that point himself, of course, now that he's standing here.
But we spoke very frankly and honestly about the need to make sure that a nontransparent government run by radical clerics doesn't get their hands on weapons of mass destruction. It could be harmful to us and harmful to Russia. And the President can speak for himself. And he gave me some assurances that I think will be very comforting for you to listen to. And I'm confident we can work together on this issue. This is in both our countries' mutual interest that we solve this problem.
President Putin. I will confirm what Mr. Bush has just said, and I agree with your evaluation of threats in this regard. Generally speaking, I believe that the problem of nonproliferation is one of the key problems as regards ensuring international security.
Incidentally, this happened to be one of the main motivating and underpinning logical stimuluses to work in Russia-NATO framework together on nonproliferation on nuclear arms.
At the same time, I'd like to point out that cooperation between Iran and Russia is not of a character which would undermine the process on nonproliferation. Our cooperation is exclusively, as regards energy sector, focused on the problems of economic nature. I'd like to point out also that the U.S. has taken a commitment upon themselves to build similar nuclear power-plant in North Korea, similar to Russia.
And in addition to Iran, I think, we also need to think about other countries here. For example, we have some questions concerning development of missile programs in Taiwan, in some other countries where we've been witnessing active work of producing mass destruction weapons and their carriers. All of that should be a subject of our in-depth discussion both bilaterally and in the frameworks of NATO-Russia agreement. That's one of the key issues of the modern times, I believe.
It would seem to me that in order to be efficient, in this sense, like in other areas, we need to address the main task, to upgrade confidence mutually. And today I mentioned to President Bush here that as regards Iran and some other countries, according to our data, the missile programs of those countries, nuclear programs, are built largely on the basis of the technologies and with the support of the Western companies. We do have such info, and we stand ready to share it with our American partners. So if we pursued that way, not dealing with generalities, then we'll get results with respect to this very complicated and very important for our two countries track.
And the conclusive question—[inaudible].
Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty
Q. Mayak Radio Station. To both Presidents, to what extent the treaty ensures real nuclear parity, and are there conditions that the treaty can be terminated by either side? And how true is the fact that Russia still remains as one of the nuclear targets for nuclear forces? And how does that relate to the announced new strategic relations between our two countries?
President Bush. Well, it is a treaty. This document is a treaty that will be confirmed by the United States Senate and the Duma, hopefully. Secondly, treaties have always had outs; there's nothing new about that. There are conditions of which things may change, and people get out of treaties. That's the way it's been. The Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty had an out; there's nothing new about that. And thirdly, you know, we are going to work to end the—forever end the cold war. And that begins with the statement that Russia's our friend, not our enemy.
And you say ""targeting""—I mean, the idea of our weaponry—our military has no aims at Russia. There may be old vestiges in place, but Russia's not an enemy. You don't think about how to deal with Russia the way they used to. Russia is a friend, and that's the new thinking. That's part of what's being codified today.
President Putin. As regards the parity, the parity relationship of sorts, the weight of military potentials and nuclear potential, and so on, so forth, each state would have its own strategy of development of what you refer to as nuclear deterrent process. But I'd like to assure you that all the action undertaken by us in this area fully confirmed with the interests of the Russian Federation. The documents signed today are a result of joint effort of the Minister of Defense and Chiefs of Staff and our Minister of Foreign Affairs, of course, jointly with our American colleagues. And we proceed from the assumption we have today, and we try to forecast the status of affairs in the world for a lengthy period of time—I would like to point out, again, for a lengthy perspective.
Now, as regards the question of verification and control, perhaps, I'd like to point out that we're very much satisfied with the U.S. administration approach to this question. Our American partners have agreed that we need to retain START I, which is provided for by the system of verification. We agreed we will continue this work on the basis of the documents signed today as well.
And what was the second part of the question, incidentally? The mike was off at this time. Regarding those targets, that was not to me. I will also make a remark here, regarding aiming targets. And Mr. Baluyevskiy, our military First Deputy Chief of Staff, is here with us. He and his American counterpart are full aware of those things, targeting aims and other things involved, and what is the status today of those aimings and targeting. All in speculations in the press are nothing but expression of domestic political infight either here or in the U.S., just on the verge of the visit.
We are not being emotional here. We're not talking to the press, but as experts, we're full aware of that, and we have no concern whatsoever in this regard.
Thank you. Thank you for your kind attention and for your participation.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-president-vladimir-v-putin-russia-moscow
George W. Bush,"May 28, 2002",Press Briefing by Secretary of State Colin Powell,"Practica Di Mare Air Force Base
Rome, Italy
SECRETARY POWELL: Well, good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. President Bush is this afternoon finishing up what we believe has been a most successful and historic trip to Europe. In Berlin and Moscow and Paris, and now here in Rome, we have made common cause against the grave threats to our liberty, to the safety of our people, and to civilization itself.
In his meetings, the President consulted with Chancellor Schroeder, Presidents Putin and Chirac and Prime Minister Berlusconi on our mutual security agenda. President Bush always values this time with America's close friends and allies.
We agreed that we must all work together to defeat terrorism, to build peace in the Middle East and calm tensions in South Asia. Above all, we agreed we must continue to expand and deepen security relationships among the members of the community of free nations.
Last Thursday in Berlin, the President paid tribute to German solidarity with the United States. He acknowledged Chancellor Schroeder's leadership and the Bundestag's courage in making German participation in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan, and also the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, making that participation possible, a breakthrough for Germany.
In Moscow, Presidents Bush and Putin signed the most dramatic nuclear arms reduction agreement in decades. The President also had the opportunity to see the sweep of Russian culture in St. Petersburg, and watched the brilliance of Russia's future reflected in the faces of St. Petersburg University students.
In Paris, the President's meeting with President Chirac ran the gamut of global and transatlantic topics and yesterday, in a very moving ceremony in Normandy, President Bush, with President Chirac in attendance, honored soldiers, Americans, Europeans and others, who fell defending freedom so many years ago. And as the President noted, today's soldiers and today's citizens continue to draw inspiration from that sacrifice.
And then today in the Eternal City, the heads of state and government of the NATO Russia Council met in session for the first time. I'm sure you all were watching the last couple of hours of that first meeting, where leader after leader took note of the historic character of today's action. All of them pledged to work with Russia and this grouping, now At-20, to build greater stability within Europe and to make Europe an inspiration for the rest of the world as to how Europe can work together not only with themselves but with their North Atlantic partners, the United States, Canada and Iceland, in this new grouping At-20, that I think will be a grouping that has important issues already placed before it, important agenda items to work on as determined at a ministerial meeting in Reykjavik two weeks ago.
And I can assure you that President Bush intends for the United States to participate fully in the NATO Russia Council, to make sure it is not just a grouping where people can talk, but it is a grouping where people can analyze the issues of importance to the 20 and act on those issues. It will be a very action-oriented council, and I look forward to playing my own role in it, as well.
With that, I'll stop and take whatever questions you may have.
MODERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, we have another group of journalists downtown, so we're going to go back and forth from one question here to one question down there, via audio feed.
Q On the Middle East, are you now talking about offering a time table for Middle East peace, as a way to chart the way forward?
SECRETARY POWELL: Did everybody hear the question? I don't think we're getting it piped in.
The question was, is the United States prepared to offer a time table for peace in the Middle East?
What we're doing is executing the strategy the President laid out in his April 4th speech, where he talked about two states living side by side in peace -- a Jewish state, Israel, and a Palestinian state, Palestine -- living in peace and harmony with one another.
He talked about the end of terror, the end of violence, and he talked about the end of occupation and the end of settlement activities. And he also welcomed in that speech the active participation of the other Arab nations of the world who can play a role in helping the Palestinians to move forward.
We have been acting on that vision that the President put down on April 4th ever since. My trip to the region and consultations we have subsequently had with the Saudi Arabians, with the Israelis and a number of other leaders who have come to Washington and we have consulted with by telephone or by other means, and we are continuing with that work with Assistant Secretary of State Ambassador Bill Burns heading to the region from Washington tonight, where he will consult with more leaders on a political way forward.
He will talk to them about transformation activities taking place within the Palestinian Authority. Activities are already being generated from within the Palestinian Authority, as you may have noticed from today's newspapers. And later this week, I think perhaps Friday, Director of Central Intelligence, George Tenet, will be heading over to undertake security discussions with parties in the region.
When we get reports back from Mr. Tenet and from Ambassador Burns, and we consult with a lot of other people, we will start to integrate all this information and see what next steps should be taken, keeping in mind that we are committed to a meeting sometime in the summer. We will bring these threads together -- humanitarian economic development, humanitarian relief, economic development, restructuring of the Palestinian Authority, working with the Palestinians, the role of the moderate Arabs.
We will also look at political options to see what the two parties believe is possible at this time, and we'll see where that takes us. But we are not at this point prepared to table an American plan with specific deadlines of the kind that was just mentioned by the questioner.
Q Secretary Powell, it's David Sanger from the Times.
SECRETARY POWELL: Hi, David.
Q Hi. Early in the trip, Secretary Powell, the President said that one of the reasons we still keep some nuclear weapons -- 2,000 of them or so under the agreement -- is that you never know how things are going to change with Russia or with other countries.
Similarly with NATO, what have been the discussions internally and what is your vision of how NATO should respond if Russia turns in a different direction at some point in the future and becomes less of a partner and again a power that needs to be contained. And how does that fit into your new arrangement?
SECRETARY POWELL: Well, I really don't expect that to happen. I don't think we're going to see a rerun of this movie. The movie didn't play well the first time, and I see no reason why any future Russian leader with a state that is only, oh, roughly 55 percent of the size of the old Soviet Union would find it in its interest in any way to try to act in an aggressive manner. And, in fact, the experience of the last 10 years is that slowly but surely Russia is coming to the realization that its future lies to the West, and the West coming to the realization that its future lies also with Russia.
And so I am looking toward a bright future, and I think what we saw here today gives every indication that that bright future is achievable, it's not a dream.
At the same time, NATO was originally created for a political purpose, but also for a security purpose -- to defend the interests of the members of NATO, the charter members and those who have been added over the years. And NATO will be expanded, more members will be coming into it.
So the self-defense aspects of NATO will always be there, increasingly the capabilities that we have within the Alliance for its collective self-defense can be used for out of area activities, and that surely will be part of our discussion in the future.
We'll always have a hedge against uncertainty in the future, in our military forces and in the nuclear weapons that the United States will continue to retain. It is a hedge against the future, because there are other nations that possess nuclear weapons or might come to possess nuclear weapons.
I have been studying and training and dealing with nuclear weapons for a large part of my adult life, and I've seen the United States arsenal go from 29,000, when I was Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff 13 years ago, when I first took over, now heading down to a strategic arsenal that will only have 1,700 to 2,200 deployed warheads. That is an enormous achievement and it reflects a far more secure, a far better world than the world that existed when all of these weapons were on a hair-trigger ready to go back and forth against one another.
And so it is prudent for us to do this downloading, this restructuring of our military forces in a sensible way, patiently, over time, making sure that we keep a hedge against uncertainty.
I've also seen the size of our conventional forces go down significantly in the last 10 years because of the change in the strategic situation, the end of the Cold War. And we should, nevertheless, remember that there is always uncertainty in the future and it is appropriate for NATO as an alliance, the United States as a nation -- Russia as a nation -- to keep a hedge for that kind of uncertainty -- but not looking for conflict. Rather, the contrary, moving in an entirely new direction.
And I think you heard some of the former members of the Soviet Union speak to that, who are now members of NATO and welcome Russia into the NATO-Russia Council today. Mr. Havel, was I think particularly moving in his comments -- the Polish leader, the Hungarian leader, all took note of this remarkable change, a change that I think will continue to go in a positive direction.
Q (Inaudible) -- presence in Central Asia and Caspian area and Greece in the future?
SECRETARY POWELL: In Central Asia?
Q -- Asia.
SECRETARY POWELL: Well, as you know, our presence in Afghanistan will continue as long as our mission is not yet completed to search out al Qaeda and the Taliban. And we are examining what present requirements we might have in Central Asia. But the United States is not looking for bases. We think it serves our interest to work with the nations of Central Asia, to have access agreements, to be able to go into their nations at their invitation, to train with them and, perhaps if necessary, to help them in their own self-defense efforts, or for a mission that might come up.
And so those are the kinds of arrangements we're looking for. But the United States is not interested in creating bases in order to have a significant military presence in the region. But to have access into the region, and to be able to work with those nations of Central Asia that wish to work with us, that seems to be us -- to us to be a very stabilizing thing.
And the enemy is quite different than the enemy we were facing so many years ago. It's now terrorism, it's now smuggling, it's now illegal immigration, it's now drug trafficking. Those are common enemies that we all now have. And to the extent that our ability to have access into that region helps all of us defeat those kinds of enemies, then those kinds of access agreements are useful.
Q But do you prefer -- (inaudible) --
SECRETARY POWELL: Well, we are certainly in discussion with the Russians over the utility of having multiple pipelines coming out of this region -- the Caspian Basin, particularly -- and I'm sure we'll continue those discussions, but I'm not here this afternoon to talk about any specific pipeline or contract arrangement.
Q Mr. Secretary, can you tell us, sir, what type of issues the United States does not want NATO to discuss with Russia? And also, sir, to what extent do you see this new arrangement as a prelude to possible Russian membership?
SECRETARY POWELL: The issues we do want to discuss with Russia will include such items as counter-terrorism activities, nonproliferation activities, civil emergencies, air space management, crisis management, arms control and confidence building measures, search and air rescue activities, civil emergencies -- those kinds of things that are common to all 20 nations.
I hope that list will grow, grow significantly in the months ahead, as confidence is built up, as we understand how this council works, and as we have had some success with these initial items that we have decided upon.
With respect to NATO's responsibilities to its own members, members of NATO, Article 5 collective security arrangements, those kinds of issues, then obviously Russia would not be included, nor would Russia wish to be included. And Russia finds this arrangement, the NATO-Russia Council, to serve its security interest, and its interest in becoming a more active member of the Euro-Atlantic community. The NRC serves that purpose, and I don't think Russia is considering at the moment applying for membership in NATO. But I will let that question remain with my Russian colleagues.
Q Two questions, if I may. Firstly, yesterday, the Russian Foreign Ministry reiterated its opposition to NATO enlargement. How is the Alliance going to react to this continuing opposition?
And, secondly, if I may ask you, how do you now characterize the war in Chechnya? Is that the final act of the Cold War, or a new front in the war against terrorism?
SECRETARY POWELL: With respect to the first one, I did see a statement that the Russian Foreign Ministry put out, saying that it continues to oppose enlargement of NATO. That does not surprise or shock me. It's been the Russian position for some time. But there is also no doubt that NATO will be inviting other nations to become members at the Prague summit, later this year.
As we have said all along, and as we've discussed with the Russians quite candidly, Russia cannot have a veto over who becomes a member of NATO or not. I also believe that because we have had this series of successes in dealing with Russia -- the NRC today, the treaty that the President signed a few days ago, the Treaty of Moscow, the political statement that the two Presidents signed in Moscow the other day, to go along with the treaty -- I think we have succeeded in making the enlargement of NATO once again less of a problem for the Russians, and less of an irritant in our relations. Russia knows that these invitations will be extended at Prague and, nonetheless, Russia is here today to participate in the signing of the NATO-Russia Council. And so I don't think it will be a major problem when the time comes to extend the invitations at Prague.
With respect to Chechnya, Chechnya is an area of enormous interest to the international community. Russia is fighting terrorists in Chechnya, there's no question about that, and we understand that. But at the same time, we believe that a political solution is really what Russia also needs to find a way to achieve. And we have always said to the Russians that in their prosecution of this campaign against terrorism, they have to make sure that the troops participating in it and other elements of the Russian armed forces and security forces have to meet the highest standards of human rights that one would expect from a civilized country.
And so that is what we discussed with the Russians. And in return, they let us know how serious they view this terrorist threat in their country.
Q Mr. Secretary, this is the President's first trip to Europe since you said that you'd have a word with some of your European allies about their concerns over U.S. policy in Europe. What's the administration learned during this trip of the state of those concerns?
SECRETARY POWELL: I think we've learned a lot on this trip. We've learned that the President has very solid relations with all the countries we visited, and I think for that matter, with all the countries we didn't visit, but who are represented here today.
That does not mean that there are not disagreements. There are disagreements over such issues as the Kyoto Protocol, the International Criminal Court; and there have been other disagreements, as well. But I think we have been very, very forthcoming in our efforts to discuss with our friends in Europe, either in the NATO setting or in the European Union setting, what our positions are, why we feel the way we do about some of these very controversial issues.
With respect to the ICC, for example, everybody has known for years that the United States had problems with the International Criminal Court, and even if it was signed, it would probably not be sent for ratification. And President Clinton made that clear when he signed it.
And so I don't think one should view an issue like that as an example of the United States essentially turning its back on its friends in Europe. Quite the contrary. We listened, we heard, we explained back to our European friends why we could not move in that direction to go along with them on the ICC. And so where we believe that we have a principle we must hold dear to, and as long as we are in discussions with our European friends, that should not be viewed as unilateralism or just going our way; we have a disagreement. And just because we are part of a great alliance and we are part of the Euro-Atlantic community does not mean that every issue we can join the consensus on.
If one looks at what we did with the Treaty of Moscow, the strategic reductions that we entered into the other day with Moscow, and go back a year or so when everybody said the United States was going off on its own and if we abandoned the ABM treaty, we were going to start an arms race, we took 10 months to discuss that issue with the Russians, discuss that issue with our European friends. We made the case, some people agreed with the case, some people did not. But it wasn't a case of the United States not sharing, not talking, not listening. And we listened, and tried to convince everybody that the ABM treaty was an anachronism and it would not destroy strategic stability.
And as a result, we left the ABM treaty. It will become formal next month, the leaving of it, but we announced it in December. And at that same day that we announced it, Mr. Putin said he would cut his strategic forces. So rather than causing an arms race, it's going the other way. I see no indication that the Chinese are going to break out in an arms race because we've left the ABM treaty.
And so where we have a principle position, what we will do is explain that principle position to our friends, try to see if we can find compromises, so we can join consensus. But where we can't join consensus, because of our own beliefs, or because we believe a particular issue and the direction it's going with others does not serve the purpose intended by that action, the United States will stick to its principle position.
And I think we go home from Europe with everybody having a better understanding of this way that we will do business: consult, talk, meet. I spent a lot of time with my European colleagues -- Don Rumsfeld does the same thing, Dr. Rice does the same thing. We'll continue to do that.
But we'll also continue to stick with those positions that we believe are the right positions and the principles positions. And the President is that kind of a leader. And he speaks clearly, he speaks directly, and he makes sure people knows what he believes in. And then he tries to persuade others why that is the correct position. When it does not work, then we will take the position we believe is correct. Where it does work, and we can join consensus with the rest of our friends and allies, that's what we'd like to do. And I think we come home with a better understanding of that, and I hope the Europeans are left with a better understanding of the way in which we want to do business.
Thank you.

George W. Bush,"July 12, 2002",Interview With Polish Journalists,"The President. I'm looking forward to our state dinner. It's a chance for me to, on a personal level, repay the favor of my friend Aleksander for his great hospitality to Laura and me when we visited he and Jolanta there in Warsaw. Secondly, it's a chance to say to our country and the world how important our relations are with Poland. We really think—respect the Polish people. We've got great numbers of Polish Americans who still love the motherland. And it's going to be a wonderful occasion to build on a great relationship, make it even better.
We will discuss a lot of topics. We'll talk about the war on terror. Poland has been a great friend and supporter, member of the coalition on the war against terror. We've got troops in the—on ships off the Indian Ocean. We've got engineers in Bagram, shared intelligence. Aleksander has been a strong friend and supporter. I'm confident he'll want to talk about NATO expansion. Perhaps I'll leave that for a question.
But all in all, we've got great relations, and I look forward to having a good conversation with a leader I respect. And I respect Aleksander Kwasniewski.
Why don't we start with you, sir.
Democracy in Poland
Q. Thank you. Mr. President, about your talks with President Kwasniewski next week, Poland has been viewed by your administration as one of the most successful examples of democratic transformation. However, the current Polish Government is taking some steps and adopting some laws which would obviously limit independence of media and central bank, which are the pillars of democracy. So are you going to raise these issues with the President?
The President. Well, first of all, I've got faith that a democracy will work. And I am confident that the Polish Government and the Polish people will come up with the right answers to issues relating to any law. I will—of course, if he asks my opinion, I will remind him that an independent media is a very important part of democracy. It's one of the pillars of democracy. I value our media, as an aside, saying that of course to pander to the people here that cover me on a daily basis. [Laughter]
But I do value a free and open media, and I think it's an incredibly important part. But your opening statement was true. We value the progress that Poland has made and the example Poland has set in a neighborhood that was a pretty tough neighborhood for awhile. And I was most impressed, when I went to Warsaw, to see the spirit of the people and the optimism. I understand the country is going through tough times, but all countries go through tough times.
President's Upcoming Visit to Troy, Michigan
Q. Mr. President, you're taking Aleksander Kwasniewski—it was your decision to go to Troy, Michigan, to meet with Polish Americans.
The President. Yes, we are.
Q. What is the reason for that meeting, and if you could tell us, what is your message to Polish Americans?
The President. Well, first of all, the message to Polish Americans is, I respect and honor the Polish traditions and Polish heritage. Actually, there was a—even in my own State of Texas, there is a community or two that Polish Americans have settled in Texas and still retains many of the great traditions and heritages.
It also reminds people that even though they have got a Polish heritage and embraced Polish traditions, they're Americans. It's a great part of the American experience. We envelop and welcome people from all walks of life. That in itself is an important statement to constantly make in our country. It reminds people of the strength of the country.
I've decided to go to Troy, Michigan, because it's going to be a—I hope it's a fun trip for Aleksander. I mean, I think it's important—I understand what a state dinner is like. It's formal. You'll see; it's going to be a grand day. They arrive on the South Lawn. The military will be there. There's a lot of pomp and circumstance. It's an exciting ceremony; it really is. And then there will be the formal dinners and the black tie, and the people will come, and the entertainment and the food—it's going to be great.
But there's more to a good American experience than just a formal dinner. I try to wear a tuxedo as little as possible, I want you to know. But flying out there to Michigan, the heartland of the country, with our friend, is going to be great. And he's going to see a big, enthusiastic crowd. It will give him a chance to say some things. And I think that's important to provide him a forum, so that he can not only be seen in a tuxedo but be seen speaking his mind about whatever issue he wants to talk about to an American audience that is made up of people from his homeland that have now settled in our country. I think it's going to be a great event. To me, it helps complete the state dinner aspect of the trip.
U.S. Economy
Q. Mr. President, I talked to Mr. Kwasniewski just before yesterday.
The President. Yes. How is he doing?
Q. Great. He looks good, in good shape.
The President. Looking forward to a 3mile run? [Laughter]
Q. He told me that one of the topics he would like to touch on is the recent financial scandals in the U.S., because they are a kind of backlash on Central Europe, and the recovery is difficult. And there's this feeling outgoing that the U.S. Government is not doing enough to change its own rules to really prevent the backlash for a Central European——
The President. Yes, I'll explain to him we are doing things, and I will be glad to lay out the initiative I talked about— and have been talking about, by the way, since March—February and March and then the speech I gave in New York. And of course, our House has acted—the House of Representatives acted, and the Senate has acted. And if he looks at what I proposed and what the Senate has proposed and what the House proposed, there's not much difference. And in other words, the point is that a bill will come out that will hold people accountable for accounting error—accounting fraud and, as we go forward, hopefully set an example—make it clear to people, there will be a consequence if they continue to do that.
There are markets—three things affect our markets, I'll explain to Aleksander. One of course is confidence and the numbers, and we're addressing that. Secondly is the war on terror. People are still—you know, realize that America is still a target. And the American people know that we're doing everything we can to protect the homeland and run down these killers wherever they try to hide. And that's all they are, by the way, just nothing but a bunch of cold-blooded killers. And thirdly, the corporate sector—the profits are beginning to improve, but the price-earnings multiples— in other words, the price of a share relative to its earnings—was very high, and the market is adjusting. So all three of those factors are important.
And obviously we—that's not the whole picture of our economy, and that's what Aleksander has got to understand. The market reflects part of it, but our unemployment rate is—looks like it's steady. It has stopped rising. As a matter of fact, it had a drop, and it's level. Our consumer spending numbers are up. Our manufacturing orders are increasing. In other words, the recovery is beginning to show some strength. So therefore, what I'm going to ask him is to look at the entire picture.
Finally, we've got good monetary policy and good fiscal policy here in Washington, and that in itself is part of long-term recovery. And so he'll hear a man who is—recognizes that we're making some progress. We've got to do more, but I'm pleased to report to him that I think things are going to get better. The foundation for long-term growth has been—is in place.
War on Terrorism
Q. Mr. President, I wanted to ask you a question about the war against terrorism. The Europeans seem to less and less support the war against terrorism. And I wonder if you could explain to us, why do you think it's happening, and if you are ready to go alone on this next phase of the war, whatever the phase is?
The President. No, I don't feel that the support from Europe is lessening. As a matter of fact, I've just come from a G- 8 meeting in Canada where, to a person, they were very supportive of our war on terror, because the Europeans recognize that the terrorists could strike them just as easy as they could strike us. We've still got great intelligence sharing amongst our nations. We've got good police action. We have hauled in—""we"" being the coalition— has hauled in—that means arrest—2,400, more than 2,400 terrorists. So we're picking them off, one by one. This is a different kind of war.
I use every chance I get, when I speak to the American people, to explain why this is different. And so—as opposed to destroying lines of tanks or shooting down airplanes, success is measured by—one by one, one person at a time. And the European leaders understand that, and they've been very supportive. They still—I think we've got about 8,000 troops in Afghanistan—we do, in the Afghan theater, and there's another 8,000 troops from other nations there as well. So it's a firm commitment.
I will continue to communicate and consult with our friends and allies as to every stage of the war, as the battlefront shifts. By the way, the battlefront isn't shifting out of Afghanistan. We're there. We'll remain there. We've got a lot of work to do there. There's still Al Qaida killers there. And of course we'll need to continue to have deliberations with our friends and allies, and we'll have them for future theaters and different operations. We talk to them all the time.
Poland's Purchase of New Fighter Jets
Q. Speaking of war, Mr. President, Poland is going to buy new fighter planes——
The President. Yes, I understand that's the case.
Q. Yes. And the F-16s are one of the——
The President. I've got a suggestion for them. [Laughter]
Q. However, President Kwasniewski just 2 days ago—you kind of—was kind of complaining that maybe the American offer is not meeting enough—expectations. So is——
The President. He's negotiating in public. [Laughter]
Q. Is your administration in any way going to support U.S. companies to win the standard——
The President. We will offer a fabulous product——
Q. Fabulous product.
The President. ——called the F-16. And we will work with our friends to make— you know, to compete on an above-board basis, totally above-board. And you know, we hope the Polish Government picks quality. If they do, they will, of course, come our way. But that's up to the Government. Aleksander will be and the Government of Poland will—you know, we will respect the process and respect the country and appreciate it's a tough decision and hope they make the right decision as far as we're concerned. But that——
Future Role of NATO
Q. Mr. President, do you think that the NATO will play as important role for the United States in the present century as it played in the previous century?
The President. Yes.
Q. And do you think it is possible that Russia one day will become NATO member?
The President. Interesting question. First, I do think NATO is very important. It's obviously a different role. NATO served as kind of a bulwark in defense against Russian tanks storming across the European Continent. Those days are over. Russia is no longer the enemy. I witnessed the fact that not only have we got good relations with Russia, but the very same trip that I—when I went to Moscow to sign this treaty that literally redefined our relationship from one of distrust and—like it was during the cold war, to a new relationship, shortly thereafter we went to Italy and welcomed a new relationship between NATO and Russia. So the whole relationship has changed for the better.
NATO has—and I think it's going to be very hard—very important to work that relationship with Russia, to allow for the— the new relationship to develop and mature. And I think it will in a very positive way.
The new relationship—the new role of NATO is—really needs to adjust to the new realities of the 21st century, and that is how to best fight the war on terror. And that means a different configuration of the use of our forces and the use of assets. Our forces need to be lighter and quicker to strike, and elite units need to be prepared to move at a moment's notice.
The enemy has changed, and the battlefield, the nature of the battlefield has changed. And therefore, the NATO mission must remain the same, mutual defense. But its tactics must change. And I think NATO is very relevant, and we will be an active and engaged partner in NATO.
Let me just—I'll ask myself, ""Well, Mr. President, do you think we ought to expand?"" [Laughter] I gave a very important speech in Warsaw. It's interesting—I hope the people in the world that are interested in our opinion on subjects noted that the speech was in Warsaw. And the speech was about a Europe that's whole, free, and at peace. And I talked about the expansion of NATO, and I said that I am interested more rather than less. And at the same time, I urged the applicant countries to take nothing for granted, to work very hard up until the last minute to show those of us in NATO that they'll be willing and active and capable partners.
And I look forward to our meeting in Prague. I fully understand the position of the Polish Government. I've had long discussions with Aleksander on the subject of NATO expansion, and I think people know that I'm forward-leaning, depending—if the member countries, you know, meet their MAP requirements.
Polish and U.S. Central Banks
Q. I want to go back to the finances and the limit. There is an attempt in Poland to limit independence of central bank, so it would be more—be manipulated more by Government, so Government would have more influence over central bank. In the current situation, what's your feeling about this?
The President. Well, first of all, I don't know all the facts about how the Polish democracy is handling this particular situation. I can tell you, however, from my experience, that a central bank should be independent. And the independence of our central bank gives Chairman Greenspan and the other Governors of the Federal Reserve great credibility in our country, to know that decisions are being made apart from politics. And our central bank is a part of— is a very important part of our—has been and will continue to be a very important part of the economic vitality of our country. It also gives investors who look at our country great confidence to know that the monetary supplies be not based upon politics, but the decisions on monetary supplies will be based upon the vision of some very wise people.
I think, when people look at how capital moves into countries, the independence of a central bank is an important part of attracting capital. And Poland needs to attract capital investment. If anybody were to ask me my advice on the central bank, that's what I would give.
President's Popularity in Poland/President's Vacation
Q. I'd like to ask you about different subject. According to the latest polls, you are the most popular foreign politician leader in Poland.
The President. Really? I usually say I don't believe in polls, but I may have to change my mind. [Laughter]
Q. With the same approval rate as President Kwasniewski. And I want to ask you to comment on this, and——
The President. Well, how high is it?
Q. Would you be willing to visit Poland again?
The President. Seventy-three?
Q. Why don't you go to Poland?
The President. Again?
Q. On holiday.
The President. Thanks. I don't know what to say. I appreciate that. I'm flattered.
Q. Are you willing to spend a vacation in Poland? With your parents, obviously?
The President. With my parents? I don't know if my mother could stand that. But listen, when I vacation, just kind of know about me, I like to be with my family, and I like to be in Texas.
I just recently went to Maine. I'd love to go to Maine, too, to be with my mother and dad. But my favorite vacation spot is my own ranch in the State I love. And I like to get out and fool around on the land, and it doesn't matter how hot it is or how cold it is. How hot it is and cold it is matters to those who have to follow me. For me, there is no day hot enough or cold enough. [Laughter] These poor souls—Crawford in August. That's my idea of vacation.
Although I must say, I had a great time up with Mother and Dad this weekend, and I love to be around them as well. But this August, I'm going to go down to Texas and actually work out of Texas. I'm going to travel quite a bit. After all, we're getting into the political season here in America. We've got our elections in November of 2002.
September 11/War on Terrorism
Q. Mr. President, we talk a lot about how September 11th changed the world, changed America. Has it changed you?
The President. Changed me?
Q. Yes.
The President. I don't think a single event can change anybody's basic values. It obviously changed the fact that I knew that my time as the President would be dedicated to winning the war on terror and protecting our homeland.
This is—I keep telling people this—it's just a different type of war, because much of the movement of the enemy is invisible to the American people and/or to the world. And yet we know they're there. The killers on September the 11th had been in our country for a period of time. They behaved normally. They looked normal. They, you know, were nonthreatening. It was hard to tell that they were part of this unbelievably evil plot.
And it—we're concerned that another group are here or somewhere, not only here but in other countries in Europe. And so the task is an all-consuming task of protecting our homeland and making sure we do everything we can here to find out if anybody is here and who they are and disrupt their plans and, at the same time, hunt down their leaders.
The wars of the past had known battlefields, and it was clear that such-and-such had to happen. There had to be an invasion in order to achieve this or that. This is a hunt for individuals. We're chasing down one person at a time. They were foolishly collected up at one point in time in the Shahi-Kot Mountains, and it was a tough chore. But our brave soldiers, along with coalition soldiers, were able to go in and score great success at bringing them to justice, as I like to put it.
They're wise to our ways. They realize we're a heck of a lot tougher than they thought. They assumed America was a weak country, that we didn't really believe anything. And they're finding out that's not the way we think. And so I realized after 9/11, after I got over the grief, along with everybody else in our country, that this was a long, very important struggle.
And the struggle goes beyond just fighting an Al Qaida-type network. I have deep concerns about the development and deployment of weapons of mass destruction, and so should you, so should anybody who loves freedom, because there are nations in the world developing these weapons who hate freedom, leaders hate freedom. And what we cannot allow happen is these nations to develop these weapons and then blackmail us and/or use them.
We will have—a judgment will have missed history's call to freedom. And so I realize that this war is going to consume a lot of my time. On the other hand, these members of the press know that I am optimistic person who truly believes that we can achieve some positive things out of the evil done to the country and to the world.
So when I talk to our friends, like Aleksander and others, I remind them of this call. We're leaders in a significant moment in history, and we can't blink, and we can't—we must be determined and focused to achieve this important objective, which is peace for our children, is what we're really fighting for, civilization.
Yes, ma'am.
Free Trade
Q. Mr. President, you always said that you are supporter of removing the trade barriers.
The President. Yes.
Q. Why do you think there are so many of them still exist?
The President. Well, you know, because I think the temptation is to be protectionist. And it's easier to mollify constituencies with protectionist rhetoric. Poland suffers from protectionist policies in parts of Europe, as you know. I'm a strong believer in free trade. I want the Congress to give me what's called trade promotion authority. I will exercise that diligently to open up markets.
On the other hand, I have an obligation to enforce law. And so I recently said that the—I listened to an International Trade Commission ruling on steel. The ITC ruled that excessive steel imports were affecting our industry in a negative way. I put a temporary measure in place, which exempted, by the way, Poland. And that was a chance for the steel industry, our own steel industry, to get on its feet. But nevertheless, as I reminded members of the European Union, this only represents a very small portion of the $2 trillion of trade we have each year.
But protectionism, for some, is a viable economic remedy. And in my judgment, protectionism would be bad for the world and bad for our country.
We're opening up—we sent our man to Doha to commit to the next round of the World Trade Organization. And unlike Seattle, where it all fell apart, we were able to—""we"" being those of us in the world who support free trade—were able to move the process farther down the line. And I will continue to work for free trade. It's in our Nation's interests and the world's interests that we trade. It's in the developing world's interest that there be trade. And our country is—we've got what's called AGOA, agreement with the African countries. I'm working on a free trade agreement with Central Americans. I'd like to see a free trade agreement from Canada all the way down to Argentina.
As I say, there's protectionist tendencies that occasionally rise up. We've just got to convince our respective people that trade is in their interests.
Russia-U.S. Relations
Q. There is another President you have such a good relationship; it's President Putin.
The President. Yes.
Q. Very good working relationship, on terrorism, on oil. But there is this feeling also this is in cost of some human rights, human rights in Chechnya, press freedom in Russia—it's overlooked now—and probably some freedom of some other Russian republics. Don't you worry that this close relationship is putting your—raising other problems?
The President. No, a close relationship with Putin allows me to make the case that, on media freedom, for example—as a matter of fact, on my last trip there, I urged him to interface with media entrepreneurs from America to understand how free press actually works, something that they're not very used to in Russia. And so there have been dialog interchanges now with some of our media executives. And I do push Vladimir Putin on the need to have open media and open his media.
And secondly, in terms of Chechnya, I'm constantly talking to Vladimir Putin about relations with Chechnya and understanding and supporting minority rights. The other issue that is very important, to which we do not turn a blind eye, and which I'm deeply concerned, not only about minority rights, is proliferation, matters of proliferation. I think we're making some progress there.
The immediate concern was proliferation to Iran, and I brought that up with Vladimir every time I visited with him. It's a very important issue that he understand that an armed Iran could be very dangerous to his own country, much less to our friends the Israelis or America, itself. And we've had some very important exchanges on that.
In terms of helping make Russia a more secure place, we're working on what they call 10-plus-10-over-10: $10 billion from the U.S., $10 billion from Europe over 10 years to help secure some weapons stockpiles. Vladimir is very interested in working with us to decommission some of his nuclear submarines to make Russia and the world more safe.
In other words, my only point to you is, is that by being closer to Russia, we're able to deal more directly with some of the thorny issues that could separate us and could in fact make the West less likely to deal with Russia.
And we've got another issues at home here that has upset a lot of our people, and that's chickens. Fortunately, we're arguing over chickens and not over war, over chickens and not over missiles, like we used to. But a lot of people here feel like there was a commitment made to let U.S. chickens into Russia. And they started moving into Russia, and all of a sudden they stopped moving into Russia. And so I've been—so whether it be trade or minority rights or press, our relations are such that we're able to bring those up in a very frank and forthright way and yet still moved a very important relationship forward.
Look, friends don't always agree, but friends are more likely to be able to work things out than enemies. As a matter of fact, in the old days, if there was a disagreement between enemies, that could lead to war. And there won't be a war between Russia and the United States.
Situation in the Middle East
Q. Mr. President, a question on another very easy subject, the Middle East crisis.
The President. Yes. [Laughter]
Q. What solution do you see to the crisis, and what compromise do you expect from both sides?
The President. Yes, that's a very good question. First, I do believe that we can achieve a vision of two states living side by side, at peace with each other. And that's the vision, and that's what all policy must aim toward. It starts with understanding that it's going to be impossible to achieve that vision if terrorists are allowed to have a free run and blow up the process.
An incredibly important step toward the vision of two states living side by side is for the international community, including the Arab world, to work with us to develop the institutions necessary for the emergence of a Palestinian state that will be transparent; it will respect rule of law; it will have a constitution that will allow for a sharing-of-power arrangement; that will have institutions that outlast—are far more important than any single one person.
And we're in the process of working toward that end. Colin Powell will be meeting with what the call the Quad in New York. Foreign Ministers from the Arab world will be coming as well, later on, to work on the step-by-step process toward the emergence of a Palestinian state. And I repeat, that requires a constitution, a judiciary, transparency when it comes to financial conditions. And I believe there's financial aid available. I know there is.
[At this point, the tape machine stopped.]
The President. Something just ground to a halt. That thing had, what do we call it, a skidding halt. Sounded like it needs some new tires.
Anyway, the international community wants to help with aid, but they're not going to help with aid if it's going to be stolen. Let's put it very bluntly. And so the——
[The tape machine stopped again.]
The President. ——the press conference has clearly gone too long. [Laughter]
So we're working to get these institutions in place. Obviously as security improves, Israel is going to have to, as I said, pull her troops back to September of 2001— 2000 levels. In other words—not levels but geographic—within geographic boundaries of September 2000. They're going to have to deal with the settlements. In other words, all parties have got responsibilities. The Arab world has got responsibilities, by the way, as well, to help on the development of a security force necessary—a security force, by the way, which must exist to enforce security, not enhance the status of a single person.
So we're making progress. It requires a international commitment and a focus on a positive end, which is two states living side by side in peace. As I said, I'm an optimistic fellow and believe that if we stay at it and keep working hard, we can get there. But there's no question in my mind, as I said in my speech in the Rose Garden recently, that there's going to be some setbacks. But our Nation is committed to a peaceful resolution of the conflict.
All right, well, thank you all.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-polish-journalists-0
George W. Bush,"August 24, 2002",Statement by the Press Secretary,"The United States is deeply concerned about credible reports that Russian military aircraft indiscriminately bombed villages in northern Georgia on August 23, resulting in the killing of civilians. The Government of Georgia and border monitors of the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe have verified that these aerial bombardments occurred. The United States regrets this loss of life and deplores the violation of Georgia's sovereignty.
The United States strongly supports Georgia's independence and territorial integrity, and has welcomed similar statements by the Russian Federation. Yesterday's attacks and their denial by the Russian Government, however, belie such Russian assurances and escalate existing tension between Russia and Georgia, just as cooperative arrangements for resolving regional security problems are emerging. In this context, we call again urgently for a political settlement to the conflict in Chechnya, which would contribute to stability in both Russia and Georgia, and advance our efforts to fight terrorism and establish peace in the Caucasus.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-the-press-secretary-257
George W. Bush,"October 29, 2002",Press Briefing by Ari Fleischer,"James S. Brady Press Briefing Room
 12:35 P.M. EST
 MR. FLEISCHER: Good afternoon. I do not have any opening prepared, so I'll be happy to begin with questions. David.
 Q: Ari, on the federal charges in the sniper case, given the Republican belief in state control in so many matters and that all wisdom doesn't reside in Washington, why, with no obvious federal interest, has the federal government decided to file charges and potentially take the case away from the local jurisdictions?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I think it's appropriate for anything involving law enforcement decisions, that the appropriate authorities be the Department of Justice to explain any actions they may be taking in this matter. I think they'll be more than happy to answer any questions about it. But anything about this would come from the Department of Justice.
 Q: But can't the President defend his decision taken by his Justice Department?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I have not personally talked to the President about this, but decisions about jurisdictions in court cases are typically things that are decided by prosecutors and professionals, and not decided by the White House. And so this is a matter for the Department of Justice to enter into their professional judgment about how justice can best be served.
 Q: But the facts are that the President was made aware, blow by blow, what was happening in the investigation; he spoke about this publicly. But now he's not prepared to talk about why the federal government has to step in and take a case away potentially from the jurisdiction in which the crime was committed?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, I think it's an obvious separation for the President to be kept informed about what is happening as the sniper is on the loose, and to make certain that the federal government is doing everything it can to catch them. But once they're caught, the President understands that it should be delegated as far as the decision-making about professional Justice Department decisions on how to prosecute a case.
 Q: One more. Does politics play any role in the decision made to have a Republican U.S. attorney and a Republican Justice Department take it away from local Democratic officials?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, given the fact that you've got so many jurisdictions involved with Democrat and Republican officials alike, I think you can obviously see --
 Q: The biggest jurisdiction is a Democrat.
 MR. FLEISCHER: Obviously, this is being done on the basis of what the law enforcement professionals think is the appropriate way to proceed.
 Q: Ari, the President's U.N. resolution spells out clear deadlines for Saddam Hussein, and a clear timetable for inspections that could lead to war. The President at every campaign stop across America talks in a hypothetical fashion about what should happen if that U.N. resolution would fail, that he'll lead a coalition to disarm Saddam. What are the deadlines and timetables for the backup plan?
 MR. FLEISCHER: The President has not indicated there are hard deadlines as such. I think that it's clear from listening to the President speak that the end is coming near. The United Nations is still hard at work on this matter. They have made some progress, and it's still unclear what the ultimate outcome will be in New York.
 Q: Perhaps I wasn't clear. My question was, what are the deadlines and timetables for his backup plan? That is, acting with either congressional authorization or existing U.N. authorization.
 MR. FLEISCHER: Again, the President has not established any hard deadlines. And again, let's see what the United Nations does before I'm prepared to discuss anything that could be an alternative.
 Q: Would they be similar to the U.N. deadlines which is seven days to comply, 30 days for a full list of weapons of mass destruction, 45 days for inspectors, and 60 days for --
 MR. FLEISCHER: The President is still working through the United Nations. Let's see if the United Nations is able to get the job done or not.
 Helen.
 Q: Does the President think that it was right for Putin to gas his own people, and do we know what kind of gas was used?
 MR. FLEISCHER: We still do not have any information yet about the exact nature of the gas that was used. Embassy Moscow is working to ascertain that information. As for the President and his thinking about all of this, the President feels very strongly that responsibility for this rests with the terrorists who took these people hostage and put them in harm's way in the first place. That's where the President believes the fault lies.
 Q: He thinks then, therefore, it was okay to use gas -- I mean at any cost?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Helen, the President abhors the loss of all life in this instance. And the President makes no mistake about who is to blame for this -- the people who put people in harm's way, or the terrorists who took the lives --
 Q: I'm not asking who's to blame. Does he think it was right to use gas, or does he think there were any possible alternatives?
 MR. FLEISCHER: The President understands that in this circumstance -- you had terrorists who had proven that they were going to kill, who had already killed, who were deadly serious about killing more, who had 700 hostages, who had the theater booby-trapped and were prepared to take mass quantities of life. The President views this entire matter as a tragic one, but it's a tragedy that was brought on as a result of the terrorists who put people in the way.
 Q: The answer is yes?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I'm addressing it as the President approaches it.
 Q: May I follow up on that? A couple questions on that. When America was struck on the 11th, the first call I think we got from a foreign leader was President Putin. Why hasn't President Bush called President Putin immediately after a significant terrorist event in his country?
 MR. FLEISCHER: He did, Ron. President Bush called President Putin immediately upon the taking of the hostages and offered America's support, and said that we'll stand with you during this period. So he indeed did.
 Q: Okay, sorry about that. Did the President or have any of his people asked the Russian government what type of gas was used in the siege that has affected three or four Americans?
 MR. FLEISCHER: That's what I indicated earlier; that's being worked through Embassy Moscow.
 Q: And again, have you gotten any further reading on what the U.S. reaction is to the fact that the Russians won't tell us what type of gas was used that may have hurt or killed Americans?
 MR. FLEISCHER: We're continuing to work that through, through the State Department and through embassy officials.
 Q: You don't find it surprising or frustrating that Russia just doesn't say, here's the answer? Why are they dragging their feet?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I have not heard it be characterized by the President, so I would hesitate to do so myself.
 Q: This morning you told us that the United States was consulted by Russian security services in advance of the raid. About what? What was the nature of those consultations?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I looked into the question that I got earlier, and to the best that I've been able to determine, there have been -- there was no advance notice to the Americans about the raid, no advance discussions to Americans about the nature of the raid, what it would entail, the type -- the gas. Obviously we still don't know what the gas was, so there was no -- nothing that I've been able to discern that would lead anybody to that conclusion.
 Q: But there were advance consultations about the situation?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Yes, there were. There was discussions as soon as the hostages were taken, which I think you expect any time there is any type of incident around the world, there's a tendency to information-share about anything that could be helpful. But nothing at all that I've been able to glean along the lines that I was asked this morning.
 Q: And then do you know what extent -- what the extent of U.S. programs involving this kind of weapon, this kind of gas that was used in --
 MR. FLEISCHER: I don't know specifically, Terry. What I can tell you is that the Department of Defense does have a variety of programs involving non-lethal systems, in a host of areas. I think many of these have been public before. I know there has been interesting stories in the press, for example, about foams, non-lethal foams that can be used to immobilize people, weapons that shoot nets to trap people, things of that nature that can be used in different types of military situations.
 Q: And gasses?
 MR. FLEISCHER: You'd have to talk to the Department of Defense about any of the specific, individual programs that they have. I'm not familiar with each and every one of them.
 Q: And just one on Iraq, quickly. The President, in the stump speech that John referenced, also says if the United Nations won't act, if Saddam Hussein does not disarm, the U.S. will lead a coalition to disarm him. Who -- what nation, aside from the United Kingdom, has publicly committed to join such a coalition?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, I was asked this question about two or three weeks ago when the President first started talking about this. And, one, make no mistake, that if the United Nations fails, international action will still follow. The only issue at that time will be the fact that the United Nations wrote itself out of any international action.
 I think, Terry, what is appropriate now, in the President's judgment, is for the U.N. to proceed. Let us see if the U.N. is able to do the job or not. If they are not, then I think you will have no questions about who will proceed with the coalition the United States and others will form. I think at that time it will be appropriate for those nations to be named. But at this point, the President is still content to work through the United Nations. We'll see where ultimately that goes.
 Q: Right now no public commitments aside from the -- even the United Kingdom, I guess, has said that unless --
 MR. FLEISCHER: You can rest assured that what the President said is based on the information he has gotten as he talks to other nations. But again, because the President went to the United Nations September 12th and said that he wanted to work with the United Nations for days and weeks, not months -- while time is running out in New York, they still have some time left to get the job done.
 Q: Why is time running out?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I'm sorry, Helen?
 Q: Why is the time running out?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Because I think that everybody at the United Nations -- the people who strongly support the President's position, people who are still trying to figure out where they are, and those who may oppose -- for example, like Syria -- they all recognize that it's getting time to bring this to a conclusion.
 Q: Why has time run out for North Korea?
 MR. FLEISCHER: It's a totally different circumstance. It's being handled differently.
 Q: No, it's not.
 Q: What international -- what other international action are you referring to? Would it be military force? You said there would still be international action if the U.N. fails.
 MR. FLEISCHER: The President has said repeatedly on his speeches that if the United Nations fails to take action, the United States will assemble a coalition that will force Saddam Hussein to disarm.
 Q: But don't Americans have a right to know if they're going to send their sons and daughters into battle, who else in the world is going to make a similar commitment? Why do we have to wait until the U.N. either strikes out or succeeds?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I think the President, as he indicated, wants to work through the United Nations. And people will know, but I --
 Q: But the President is the one raising this issue, saying if they fail, then we and a coalition of nations are going to go get him. So, okay, why can't we know who else that is?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Let's see first if the United Nations is capable of getting it done.
 Q: But the President puts a wall between those two.
 Q: Ari, are you waiting for the midterm elections to be over before you bring this U.N. resolution to a vote?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, the timing is ultimately going to be decided by the diplomats who are involved in it. And this will either take place this week or next week, depending on what the status of the talks is.
 Q: So domestic politics are not at all a concern?
 MR. FLEISCHER: No. I thought -- reporters have raised that question with me before, and frankly, this is a matter, I think, that if somebody wants to say, why are you voting on it the week before the election, if the vote is the week before the election -- they're going to ask that question. If they want to say, why are you voting on it the week after the election, if it's voted on the week after the election, they're going to ask that question. I fail to see how anybody can make the case that voting on it before or after benefits one party or another. The vote will be decided by the diplomats in accordance with the progress of the talks. It just so happens there is an election at the same time.
 Q: You don't think forcing a vote on a U.N. resolution before an election might scare off some voters, make voters nervous?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Elizabeth, it's not the United States that's dragging its feet. The United States went up to the United Nations on September 12th. If this could have been resolved weeks ago, I think the President would have been very satisfied.
 Lester.
 Q: Ari, you and the President have emphatically described Islam as ""a religion of peace"" -- emphatically. And in connection with that, have you heard of any public protest by any peaceful Islamic organization of what President Putin described as international Islamic terrorists in Moscow, and more of them in Bali and Israel, New York, the Pentagon, and by a Nation of Islam member, in Maryland, D.C. and Virginia?
 MR. FLEISCHER: You lost me, Lester.
 Q: No, have you heard any protest from the peaceful Muslims that you refer to, as a religion of peace? Have you heard any protest of these atrocities?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Protest in which atrocities, Lester?
 Q: All of these atrocities -- in Moscow, Bali, and elsewhere -- have you heard any protests?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Lester, I am not a protest tracker except for when I travel with the President. Then I look out the window.
 Q: Why is the use of our military to protect the skies above the District of Columbia justified when the use of U.S. troops to seal all of our borders is not being done, and an illegal immigrant from Jamaica named Malvo who was arrested by the U.S. Border Patrol was released by the INS?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Lester, one of the eternal issues that makes our country great is our openness to people from other countries. And since September 11th what we've realized is that we need to make certain that people who are not supposed to come to America, that we redouble our efforts to make certain people who don't belong here cannot get in here. By the same token, one of the things that makes us a free country and a strong country and a great country is the fact that we welcome people from other nations to this country.
 And along those lines, I was remiss, I should have noted this at the beginning. The President this morning spoke with President Mubarak of Egypt by telephone. The President consulted with President Mubarak on efforts to promote resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, including the recent trip of Assistant Secretary Burns to the region to follow up on the President's message about the importance of achieving a road map to peace in the Middle East. They talked about the issue of Iraq. The President reiterated his desire to settle this in a peaceful way, but make no mistake, that the important goal was the disarmament of Iraq.
 President Mubarak was on a trip to Morocco as the two spoke and the President also sent his regards to King Mohammed.
 Q: Ari, Putin said, in dealing with the Chechens, that this was a part of the global war on terrorism. And earlier today you were asked whether or not the administration agreed with that position. You said, to the extent that al Qaeda is in Chechnya and the rest of the world. Considering that Russia has given assistance to our war on terrorism, would the White House, would the administration consider offering intelligence or personnel or training regarding going after al Qaeda, say in Chechnya?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, we already do provide the information sharing. That is a two-way street, and very productively so. It's one of the interesting things about the end of the Cold War, and the growing relationship between the United States and Russia. We do share information with Russia in our mutual effort to fight terrorism. In addition, I'd remind you that in support of putting an end to terrorist activities in and around Chechnya, the United States is providing military training and equipment programs for Georgia, particularly in the Pankisi Gorge, a neighbor of Russia that's involved -- the hostilities have been coming from areas that are particularly centered around the Pankisi Gorge.
 Q: Considering what the President has said about the use of poison gas recently, are there some circumstances in which it is okay to use it?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, again, I think that it's important to find out first what exactly was the gas that Russia used. And it's impossible to characterize it beyond that unless we know.
 Q: On the U.N., Hans Blix and Mohammed El-Baradei briefed the Security Council yesterday. What was the significance of their testimony? What is your view of what they told the Security Council about the regime for inspections?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, the briefing that was done by two of the leaders of the inspection regime was very notable. It was notable for what it said about the importance, in their judgments, about having -- these are my words -- but a tough and effective resolution so they can go about and do their jobs. They did both express a concern about going back into the country in the absence of a clear, strong resolution.
 In addition, when they were asked about whether or not the resolution needed to have the words ""material breech"" in it, they did indicate -- and I want to find the verbatim on this to be precise -- but a reporter asked Dr. Blix, will it help you if ""material breech"" will be defined in the resolution? And his answer was, ""I think it helps us if Iraq is conscience that non-cooperation will entail reactions by the Council.""
 They both were diplomatic in stating that it is up to the United Nations Security Council to settle the exact words and make any determinations from that point forward. But that's a very notable statement about the inspectors themselves believing they think it helps if Iraq is conscience that non-cooperation will entail reactions by the Council. I think the last thing the inspectors want to do is go in there and be led around again in more cat-and-mouse games. They want to do their job, they want to disarm Saddam Hussein.
 Q: -- Russians had objected to the inspections regime in the U.S. and British resolution, saying that they were unrealistic and unimplementable. Does the U.S. now believe that any of the Russian concerns have faded away, or at least been softened by the Blix and El-Baradei --
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, again, what keeps striking me about this whole process at the United Nations is the swirl of words, some of which are repeated privately, some of which are not; some of which are said publicly for no other intention or purpose than to be said publicly. And that's the nature of diplomacy. That doesn't apply to only one nation, that simply is how these things sometimes go. So the real action will remain action behind closed doors and the Security Council, and we'll see where that leads. No one has a clear picture of it yet, but ultimately it will go.
 Q: One last detail on the timing. What -- it's not the elections, it's not other things, what is it? What does determine the timing of the vote?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I think it would be determined by a conclusion by the diplomats that all other options have been exhausted, that there is no more room for discussions, that all discussions have led to the most fruitful point that is allowable, and that it's time for people to put up their hands and vote.
 Q: In Asia, Japanese officials have now opened a dialogue with North Korea about that country's nuclear weapons program. I wonder if you could give us an update about efforts to bring diplomatic pressure on North Korea on that issue, and when will the U.S. begin to talk directly with North Korea about the concerns Mr. Bush had?
 MR. FLEISCHER: The President is, one, gratified about the support that he has received from President Jiang Zemin of China, as well as President Koizumi -- Prime Minister Koizumi, and President Kim of South Korea over the weekend. The President thought the remarks at the -- by the leaders, particularly their call publicly for North Korea to immediately dismantle its weapons program, was constructive.
 Now what will happen is this is going to shift to the ministerial level. And you will see continued talks among the United States, South Korea and Japan, as well as China and Russia, about how to proceed. And we will ultimately find out what North Korea's intentions are, whether or not they see their way forward in the world in a world of cooperation or in a world of isolation. The President hopes it will be in a world of cooperation.
 Q: Is there a role for the U.S., though, in the near-term? You mentioned the regional --
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, we'll see. We'll see exactly what the -- what type of talks, if any, will ensue. But the United States thinks it's appropriate for Japanese officials and South Korean officials to be in touch with their counterparts in North Korea. They will do so, appropriately so. But the United States will remain firm in calling on North Korea to make certain that it dismantles its weapons programs.
 Q: I want to make sure I understand your answer about the question on the Moscow raid. You said that there were advance consultations on the hostages. Did any of those consultations between American and Russian officials regarding the hostages get into the area of what the Russians might or might not be about to do to free those hostages?
 MR. FLEISCHER: To the best that I've been able to learn in the inquiries that I have made, I have no information that would support that the United States had any advance knowledge of the tactics that would be used or the nature of the raid.
 Q: To your knowledge, there was no American input of any kind into --
 MR. FLEISCHER: How it transpired?
 Q: Right.
 MR. FLEISCHER: No, I have not been able to determine that from anybody I've talked to.
 Q: One more on Chechnya, if I may. I understand your answer that the President believes that the main responsibility for the violence rests with the Chechen terrorists. Does the President believe that the Russian armed forces bear any responsibility for driving the Chechnens to terrorism, given the tactic that Russian armed forces has used since 1994 in Chechnya?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, the President's position toward the conflict, itself, in Chechnya has been loud and clear, and that is, the best solution and the ultimate solution to the dispute in Chechnya is a political one. And the President has made that point repeatedly, publicly and privately with Russian officials.
 Q: I understand that, but the question is, there is a history to this thing. Chechen terrorism didn't begin, didn't, sort of spring full grown from someone's brow. Does the Russian armed forces, does the Russian government bear any responsibility for driving some number of Chechens into terrorist actions out of desperation, given the kind of tactics that the Russians have used?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Ken, I can tell you something as powerfully, as unequivocally as I possibly can from the President of the United States: There is no excuse for terrorism in any part of the world by anybody for any reason, no matter how worthy they believe their political goals. No matter how much any individual or group thinks that their political goals are more important than anybody else's -- there is no excuse to engage in terrorism innocent civilians and taking people hostage as the means of trying to achieve their political goals.
 Q: And in the President's view there's no connection between the tactics that the Russian armed forces have used --
 MR. FLEISCHER: Again, your question supposes that the Russians are to blame for the terrorists taking Russian citizens hostage. And the President does not share that. The President knows that the people responsible, the people who shoulder the burden and the blame are the terrorists. And there is no excuse -- around the world, in any region -- for people resorting to terror against innocent civilians to achieve their civilian goals.
 Q: Does that include the past, Ari?
 Q: Ari, does the administration take comfort in the strong words that President Putin said about now really waging a war on terrorism? And as part of that, I mean, does it ease their opposition to what we're trying to do with Iraq?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Larry, I don't know that I can say that the President takes comfort in hearing these strong words. I think, frankly, the President's first reaction is sorrow that other nations around the world are being victimized by terrorists, whether it's President Megawati in Indonesia and the people of Indonesia and the people of Australia, or whether it's the Russians now and President Putin. I don't think the President welcomes the fact that other nations are facing up to some of the same issues that we faced up to after September 11th, because they are now victims of people who are killers and murderers.
 I think the President does recognize that the world does see how global this terrorist threat can be, how important it is for us to work together with our allies and friends on a common approach to terrorism.
 That's one of the positive outcomes of the APEC summit that the President just left in Mexico, where the nations of the Pacific are talking about how to work together to protect against terrorist threats. It's one of the reasons there was an initiative there to -- just like in Canada, at the recent G-8 summit -- to bind our nations together, where United States Customs officials will go to ports abroad to work collaboratively with our friends in those ports to prevent terrorists from using foreign soil to reach American soil.
 So in some ways, the world is joining as one in the fight against terrorism. But no matter what has caused a nation to step up to its fight of terrorism, the President expresses sorrow that innocent lives are taken as the world steps up.
 Q: And do you see it as having any kind of implications for the situation with Iraq and Russian cooperation?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I have not heard anybody make that case, so I can't say it.
 Q: If I can change the subject for a moment. Earlier, it was announced that the President will be traveling to Florida this weekend to do some campaigning. I was wondering if the President's brother, the Governor, has assured the President that there will not be any voter irregularities, or that the voter irregularities that popped up in the primaries about two months and, of course, in the 2000 elections, have been remedied. Has that conversation taken place?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I'm not privy to every discussion the President has with his brother. But I can assure you that in all 50 states I think every governor hopes that, regardless of party, that any type of election problems are kept to as absolute a minimum as humanly practical. Clearly, there are many lessons to be learned from 2000, and the state of Florida reacted to them and has provided tremendous amount of funding and resources to the various counties throughout Florida as a result of that. I think other states, as well, have done their best individually to respond to what happened there.
 This race is, of course, the number one target for the Democratic National Committee, as said by the Chairman of the Democratic National Committee. They said this is their number one target, their number one goal is to defeat Governor Jeb Bush. And we'll see ultimately what the outcome of that race is.
 Q: An unrelated follow, if I may -- and I apologize if this was asked of you yesterday, while you were on the road. The Justice Department has released its uniform crime statistics. It shows an increase in crime, the first in 10 years. I was wondering if the President has been made aware of that and what the White House feels may have caused this spike upward?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Let me -- I'll have to take a look and see if the President has. I saw briefly a report on those statistics this morning, but I have not seen an evaluation of the causes for it. Let me see if I have any evaluation I can offer, and I'll post it.
 Q: Yes, Ari, two questions. The first one has to do, a week from today we're going to have elections in this country. And one of the states that is very tight, as pollsters tell us, is Minnesota. Today, a special service is being held for Senator Paul Wellstone. Is the President going to visit Minnesota after today, to help the Republican nominee?
 MR. FLEISCHER: We've announced our schedule through Saturday. We'll
 have additional announcements over the next day or two, and we'll keep you filled in about anywhere the President may go.
 Q: Is that an option?
 MR. FLEISCHER: All 50 states are options. And, as you know, we have a regular practice of fully informing you as the decisions are finalized and as it gets closer to the events.
 Q: Another question. When President Bush, according to you, called President-elect of Brazil da Silva, and told him he looks forward to working with him, especially with regard to advancing democracy, good governance and free trade in the hemisphere. It's been the practice here, many times the President-elect visits Washington and meets with the President before he takes office. Being that Brazil is such an important component of the economic situation of our hemisphere, especially South America, is President Bush going to meet with President da Silva before he takes over?
 MR. FLEISCHER: During the conversation, the President extended an invitation to President da Silva to come and visit the United States. And of course, clearly, it still is the term of President Cardoso in Brazil, so at the appropriate time he will review his schedule in Brazil and I'm certain that the two will meet somewhere.
 Incidentally, I said all 50 states are options. I should back up, it may not be fully the whole gamut of all 50 being options, but many are.
 Q: Hawaii. (Laughter.)
 MR. FLEISCHER: Hawaii? Do I hear Hawaii, John Roberts?
 Q: And Alaska.
 MR. FLEISCHER: And Alaska.
 Q: Just on that very point, I just want to ask, could you explain, what is the sensitivity to talking about campaigning in Minnesota? I mean, obviously, it's something -- I don't want to give you the answer, but -- (laughter.)
 MR. FLEISCHER: The service is tonight for Senator Wellstone. And there will be a time for politics and there will be a time again as the people of Minnesota focus on the fact that there is still an election day scheduled. Today is not the day. Today is a day to remember Senator Wellstone.
 Q: Ari, can I follow up on what you said earlier about words that are being said at the United Nations that are being said for the purpose of being said? I'm wondering if you're telling us that those diplomats are sending a signal of disunity that really is playing into Saddam Hussein's hands. Those diplomats -- you were talking the debate and some of the public statements --
 MR. FLEISCHER: Is what playing into Saddam Hussein's hands?
 Q: Some of the public statements at the United Nations Security Council, which you suggested didn't mirror what was happening in private --
 MR. FLEISCHER: Right.
 Q: -- are sending a signal of disunity on the Council that's playing into Saddam Hussein's hands.
 MR. FLEISCHER: No, what I'm saying on that is that is obvious in any type of negotiation, particularly negotiation involving diplomats, there are various levels of discourse. Not all of the levels of discourse that are public are shared privately. And so there's always an attempt to trying to push the envelope farther out so that an ultimate compromise is closer to what somebody really wanted. That's the nature of negotiations. That's what I'm alluding to.
 I think the ultimate test about whether or not there is any signal sent to Saddam Hussein will come in its final form -- whether the United Nations has an agreement or doesn't have an agreement. That will be, indeed, a signal to Saddam Hussein. And that's why the President called on the United Nations to be the United Nations and not the League of Nations.
 Q: In light of Quest restating their earnings and consumer confidence a question at this point, what -- other than tax cuts, what does the President plan, or does he have any plans to think about stimulating consumer confidence in the economy?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, clearly, Congress has still left unfinished the business of terrorism insurance with the hundreds of thousands of jobs that that can create. And the President hopes that when Congress comes back for the lame duck session, they'll be able to finish the work on that. It got close, it didn't get finished.
 The President hopes that Congress will fully fund the budget priorities the President has sent up to the Hill, which are pending, particularly in the area of homeland security, which has money for bioterrorism defenses and for first responders' needs. There are many issues pending up there that Congress has to address. And once they're finished with these important priorities, the President hopes that they will hold the line on spending, because the President worries about the effect of deficit spending and overspending can have on fiscal discipline.
 The energy bill that is pending up in the Congress is also good for America. It represents energy independence. It also represents conservation. But the President still views the economy as the fundamentals remain strong; that the economy is not as strong as he would like it to be, but particularly, another area that can be effective is the acceleration and the making permanent of the tax relief.
 Q: Ari, the former head of the Mosad, Israel's intelligence agency, says ""World War III has started."" Considering 9/11 and the fact that the U.S. is now engaged in a worldwide war against terror, is he right?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, I don't want to get into a semantic issue. The President has said, of course, that we are at war. The President described the action following September 11th, against the Taliban and al Qaeda as phase one of the war. If you remember in, I think it was March of 2002, the President talked about the expansion to make certain that al Qaeda has minimized in its ability to reconfigure itself in places like Yemen and the Philippines and elsewhere. And the President clearly is concerned about global terrorism and people who would use terrorist means to harm our citizens either here or abroad.
 Q: This relates to my friend, Sarah's question. In the wake of the murder of the U.S. diplomat in Jordan, will the United States draw down Americans in nations where they are at risk? And will you assist in their protection? I know that you used the phrase ""take precautions,"" but that really doesn't help when the whole country is dangerous.
 MR. FLEISCHER: Connie, unfortunately, the State Department has a vast experience in dealing with how to protect Americans abroad. Fortunately, Jordan is not the first country in which Americans who valiantly serve our country -- either in the State Department, the Foreign Service, AID or any of the other number of agencies -- where people and their families move abroad to serve America are threatened. So these issues all get evaluated by the State Department, by their security personnel on the ground. I'm not in a position to give you any further updates from State. State will have that, based on their information.
 Q: What about warning Americans, private Americans, in a lot of these dangerous countries?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, travel advisories, again, that is all done by the State Department.
 Q: Ari, security issues are a major part of the President's standard stump speech. Does the President believe the country will be safer if both Houses of Congress were in Republican hands?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I think the President believes that the agenda that he believes in will have much more of a chance of passing if there were members of the Congress in both the House and the Senate who shared his view. And, clearly, when you take a look at what has not gotten done on the Hill this year, you can see a great many issues which would have gotten done if the House and the Senate had been in Republican hands. And so the President looks at this from a very broad picture and thinks that it would better for the country if many of the items on his agenda had enough support to get passed into law. So he is talking about, when he campaigns, the need to have a Republican Senate and a Republican House.
 Q: That he believes the country would be more secure if both Houses were in Republican hands?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, I think there's no question that if the Senate had been in Republican hands, the homeland security bill would have passed already.
 Q: Let's be clear about this, so we don't get calls back later on our leads. Were you answering the question yes or no? It sounds like you were saying yes.
 MR. FLEISCHER: I was answering the question that the President believes a broad agenda, including the creation of the department of homeland defense, would have more of a chance of being passed into law if the House and Senate had more people who supported the President's agenda. I'm not going to -- I think members of both parties have a desire to make America safe. I don't think anybody has questioned that. But when it comes to the purpose of campaigning, the President wants to elect people from both parties who support his agenda.
 Q: Is the United States committed to a U.N. vote and having a vote, even if it becomes clear that the President's position is not going to prevail?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, we'll see, ultimately, again, what happens as this thing heads down to zero hour. It's not there yet. It's approaching, but it's not there yet. And we'll see. I have not really heard if people have come to the final conclusions that if there is not enough support whether it should or should not go to a vote. I don't think people are looking at it that way yet, Ron. I think people are still trying to look at how we can put this together if we can.
 Q: So right now you're not committed to having an up or down vote
 --
 MR. FLEISCHER: No, I'm just saying I haven't heard any conversations about that level of tactical planning. The focus right now is still working with France and Russia and everybody else to get to the point where there is sufficient support for it to pass.
 Q: But if you've already acknowledged the possibility of defeat, wouldn't you also say what are we going to do if it looks like we're losing?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I think things are defeated because, one, either they're vetoed, two, they're not voted on, or three, they're defeated. And any one of those could be the possibility, or it could pass. And I don't think anybody is going to know which of those various possibilities will take place until probably shortly before the vote. In some ways, it's not unlike the Congress; when there's a vote, sometimes you don't know how it's going to go until the vote is called.
 Q: Ari, on the economy, you mentioned a few moments ago measures are pending in Congress that could help stimulate growth. There are other measures out there that are being talked about -- extending unemployment insurance, rebates, et cetera. However, there is a column in the Wall Street Journal today by Allen Murray which says that the best way to reinvigorate the economy is not by changing monetary or fiscal policy in any of these ways, but to end the business and investment uncertainty that now exists because of our Iraq policy. If I may quote, he says that, ""The best tonic for the U.S. economy would be a successful war or a bloodless end of the Saddam Hussein regime."" What is the administration's response?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, the administration's response is that in the event that there is any military action in Iraq, it's not going to be driven by economic considerations, it's going to be driven by the need to protect the American people from the real-life threat involving Saddam Hussein in his pursuit of weapons of mass destruction. That would be the factors that the President considers.
 Q: Do you believe, though, that in terms of business uncertainty, that a factor that contributes to it right now is this uncertainty as to whether or not the United States is going to war?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I think that a variety of economists have looked at a variety of factors in the economy and tried to determine what has created the economy that we presently have. And there's no unanimity among the economists -- and I'm not an economist, so I wouldn't want to venture into what the exact causes are.
 Q: Ari, getting back to the question on a U.N. vote, in his speech in September, the President -- and you've quoted this many times -- said it would be a matter of days and weeks, not months. And that takes us roughly to November 12th. Do you think that's an adequate time frame to work in? Can we expect to see a resolution --
 MR. FLEISCHER: That's why I was indicating earlier that the President would have been satisfied if the United Nations was able to address this issue and come to a conclusion earlier than they have. We are approaching the point where it's months, and the President said that he did not want it to go months. And so I think that --
 Q: Was that then just a figure of speech for him, or does he view that as a literal marker that the U.N. should abide by?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I have not heard the President give a hard date. But I think everybody sees that the United Nations is approaching decision time. And that, I think, is something that you hear from not only the United States, but from France and from other nations that serve on the United Nations Security Council. It's been a good debate; it's been a long debate; the time will soon come for the debate to end.
 Thank you.

George W. Bush,"November 13, 2002",Press Briefing by Scott McClellan,"The James S. Brady Press Briefing Room
 12:32 P.M. EST
 MR. McCLELLAN: Good afternoon. Let me start by running back through the President's day. The President started this morning having breakfast with the bipartisan leadership: Speaker Hastert, Leader Lott, Leader Daschle and Leader Gephardt, where they -- the President gave them an update on the war on terrorism and Iraq. And they also discussed the importance of getting the homeland security department legislation passed and to the President's desk before they leave. And they also discussed the importance of terrorism insurance and getting our hard-hats back to work.
 Then the President had his usual briefings following that. And later this morning the President participated in his Cabinet meeting. The President's Cabinet, as he noted, talked about homeland security, about strengthening our economy, as well about maintaining fiscal discipline. And he received a number of updates from his Cabinet Secretaries on various activities they're involved in.
 The President later this afternoon will meet with the United Nations Secretary General Annan, where they will discuss the U.N. resolution and the situation in Iraq, the Middle East, and development and security in Afghanistan as well.
 Then tonight, the President participates in the White House Symposium on the West Wing, which is to commemorate and celebrate the 100th anniversary of the West Wing.
 I would like to mention the homeland security department legislation. We are pleased with the progress that has been made. It appears that the congressional leadership is ready to move forward on this legislation and get it to the President's desk before they do adjourn. This legislation, as it is now, appears to be a strong -- this legislation appears to be strong and meet the President's requirements for a strong homeland security department. And we are hopeful the Congress will get it to him by the holidays.
 With that, I am glad to take your questions. John Roberts.
 Q: In it's 9-page letter to the U.N. Security Council accepting the conditions of Resolution 1441, Iraq makes the assertion that it has no weapons of mass destruction, that it is ""clean."" What's the White House's opinion on that declaration?
 MR. McCLELLAN: Well, John, I haven't seen what's in the letter yet. I've heard the reports and I would remind you that this was never a question of accepting or rejecting the resolution. The U.N. resolution is binding on Iraq and the Iraqi regime. Saddam Hussein had no choice but to accept the resolution.
 I would also remind you that we have heard this before from Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi regime. Now we need to see it by Saddam Hussein's actions. We need to -- the onus continues to be on Saddam Hussein. This is his choice.
 And I would go back through what the regime in Iraq needs to do: Iraq must provide a full accounting of all weapons of mass destruction -- the programs, materials and delivery systems -- within 30 days, that's what the resolution spells out; Iraq also must allow free, unimpeded, unconditional immediate access for weapons inspectors anywhere, any time, to anyone; and Iraq must also allow witnesses to weapons of mass destruction programs to be interviewed outside of the country and to bring their families with them; and Iraq must also stop firing on the U.S. and British aircraft patrolling the no-fly zones.
 Q: But this assertion that Iraq possess no weapons of mass destruction, does that seem plausible to you?
 MR. McCLELLAN: Well, John, again, I haven't seen the specifics of the letter, but the resolution clearly spells out for the regime in Iraq that any false information or omissions are considered a violation of the resolution and would be considered a further material breach. That's all spelled out in the resolution.
 But, again, I would reiterate that -- the latest reports that the regime in Iraq has agreed to cooperate and comply, that we have heard this before and now it's time to see it by their actions.
 Q: If they don't stop firing on coalition planes in the no-fly zone, is that a material breach?
 MR. McCLELLAN: I just indicated to you that part of the resolution calls for the regime in Iraq to stop firing on aircraft patrolling the no-fly zones. You're trying to get into ""ifs"" and hypotheticals and, as I said yesterday, I'm not going to get into every if and hypothetical. It makes clear in the resolution that if there are violations, that the countries, or the inspectors, are to report that to the Security Council where there will be further discussion about what consequences may follow. But just because there are discussions at the Security Council, I would remind you that that does not prohibit the President from using his authority to act with like-minded nations if need be.
 Q: Scott, you noted that Iraq has 30 days, or until December 8th, to provide a complete accounting of its weapons of mass destruction. It has; they don't have any.
 MR. McCLELLAN: Well, again, this letter apparently, I understand, has been delivered to the United Nations. We have not seen -- or maybe we are reviewing this letter as I speak, but I have not seen the contents of the letter. We'll look at the letter and we'll go from there.
 Q: Is the United States prepared to provide evidence to counter Iraq's assertion that it has weapons of mass destruction?
 MR. McCLELLAN: Well, again, they have a 30-day deadline to list and disclose all that information. I haven't seen the contents of the letter, so I don't want to jump into what I haven't seen at this point. But it's been made clear, if there is false information or omissions, then that would be considered a violation.
 Q: And saying that they had no weapons of mass destruction would be false information, according to the United States?
 MR. McCLELLAN: Well, again, I haven't seen the contents of the letter. So let's -- they have a 30-day time line to report all that information.
 Q: I asked you this morning -- Benjamin Netanyahu, running for leadership to the Likud Party, has said if elected he will expel Yasser Arafat. What is the U.S. position on the expulsion of Yasser Arafat by any Israeli government?
 MR. McCLELLAN: Terry, as I mentioned earlier, there are -- we recognize that there are elections upcoming in Israel, and the United States has a long policy of not getting involved in those internal domestic discussions that are going on within Israel. But the President's views are very clear; they were laid out in his June 24th speech when he outlined a road map to our goal of achieving two states living side by side in peace. And we're working with all parties in the region to implement that road map.
 But I'm not going to go and venture into internal discussions that are going on within Iraq.
 Q: So we have no position on whether or not --
 MR. McCLELLAN: Well, the President -- I think the President's views were fairly clearly spelled out in his June 24th remarks, and I would refer you back to those. But you're asking me to jump into internal debates or discussions that are going on in an upcoming election in Israel. I'm not going to do that.
 Q: Scott, there were also reports overnight that the -- that the United States and Israel agreed to put the road map initiative on hold pending the elections. Can you confirm that?
 MR. McCLELLAN: We remain committed to pursuing that road map and we are going to continue working with all parties within the region. I don't know which exact report you're referring to, but --
 Q: It was an Haaretz report, it said Dr. Rice and her Israeli counterpart agreed to this, I believe yesterday.
 MR. McCLELLAN: That may well be. I'll look at the report; I haven't looked at it.
 Q: Secondly, has the United States taken a position on the fuel oil shipment now on its way to North Korea? I understand there was a National Security Council meeting this morning that was to address that issue?
 MR. McCLELLAN: There was a National Security Council meeting this morning. As you know, we don't discuss the discussions in those meetings. And, as I would also point out, we do not comment on intelligence matters from this podium.
 But the United States has had consultations with the Japanese and the Korean governments. Assistant Secretary Jim Kelly has been in the region, as you're aware. And the executive board of KEDO, the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization, is meeting later this week to discuss how to proceed. And the executive board includes South Korea, Japan, the European Union and the United States. And we'll let those discussions proceed. We're working this through diplomatic channels, as you're aware.
 But one thing is clear to North Korea, we have made it clear to North Korea, that this is not business as usual: North Korea must dismantle its nuclear weapons program. We seek a peaceful resolution and we are going to continue to work through those diplomatic channels with our friends and our allies to keep maximum pressure on North Korea. If North Korea wants to be part of the international community, then they must dismantle their nuclear weapons program.
 Q: Apparently, the South Koreans and Japan are not willing to suspend these shipments immediately.
 MR. McCLELLAN: I've seen those reports and, again, we're continuing to work this through diplomatic channels. When there's more information, then we'll be ready to discuss it at that time.
 Q: Scott, as a general matter, does the President believe that deficits are bad for the economy over the long haul? And if he does, then does he believe a fundamental choice has to be made by the White House and by Republicans on the Hill between the notion of further stimulus to the economy in the form of tax cuts, or things like a $400 billion prescription drug benefit under Medicare?
 MR. McCLELLAN: Well, David, I remind you that the primary reason for the deficit that we are in now is the war and the recession. And I would also point back to what private economists have said, that the tax cut that was passed when we came into office was well timed. And it was because of the tax cut, it was a contributing factor that the recession was one of the shortest and shallowest ever. So we have continually made the point that surpluses don't create growth; growth creates surpluses. And so that's what I would go back to.
 Q: That doesn't answer the question, which is that it doesn't matter what happened on September 11th, the price of prescription drugs are still what they are and insurance is going to be what it is.
 So, given this climate, which is likely to get worse if there's war in Iraq, financially, does the President believe Republicans have to make a choice? Either we further stimulate the economy with a new round of tax cuts, or we do things like a prescription drug benefit on the Medicare? At the moment, Republicans are talking about accomplishing everything.
 MR. McCLELLAN: Well, David, I think there's a way to accomplish this. The President has a history of showing this, where -- and he talked about this a little bit earlier, where we can fund our priorities and hold the line on spending elsewhere. Then we can meet those important priorities that you just mentioned.
 We do need to continue to look at additional ideas, which the President is, to stimulate the economy. He is committed to working with Congress to create a new jobs and economic growth package early next year, and we are moving forward in that direction. At the same time, as he pointed out earlier, we need to get terrorism insurance passed. That's something the lame duck Congress can do before they leave. This will put our hard-hats back to work. It's a job creations measure.
 And tax cuts. The President has talked about making the tax cuts permanent to bring some certainty to people's minds there. Those are all important measures that we are pursuing. And then we're looking at additional ideas as well to work with Congress on.
 Jeanne.
 Q: Does the administration oppose the delivery of that oil shipment to Korea?
 MR. McCLELLAN: Well, again, I think I addressed it. We're working this through diplomatic channels right now. There is a meeting that is going to happen --
 Q: But what is the administration's position?
 MR. McCLELLAN: There is a meeting that is going to happen later this week, and we need to let the discussions happen at that meeting through diplomatic channels, not through media channels.
 Q: So you won't tell us what the position of the administration is on whether that oil should be --
 MR. McCLELLAN: Our position for North Korea is very clear. This is not business as usual, as I said. North Korea needs to dismantle its nuclear weapons program, and we are continuing to work through diplomatic channels to seek a peaceful resolution in the region.
 Q: On Harvey Pitt, anything new today on that or --
 MR. McCLELLAN: No. And as you know, I don't speculate on personnel matters.
 Q: And you won't be announcing any today? At least that one.
 MR. McCLELLAN: I don't speculate on timing or personnel announcements. Let me go to Jim. Oh, Jim and Jim. You guys figure it out. (Laughter.)
 Q: On Harvey Pitt, can you describe what the urgency is to filling that job, and then to filling the accounting oversight job?
 MR. McCLELLAN: Well, we are moving as quickly as possible. The President believes that the accounting oversight board needs to move forward quickly and aggressively on the work that it has before it. And we will work to find someone who has broad experience and is well-qualified, that can continue the efforts that the SEC has been working on to crack down on corporate wrongdoing. And we are moving as quickly as we can.
 Q: I want to go back to a material -- different question, if I can. You specifically mentioned the firing on U.S. and British planes in the no-fly zones. That is not something the inspectors have anything to do with, so one would not expect them to report back any violations. That would have to come from the U.S. and Great Britain.
 MR. McCLELLAN: Others are able to report, through the resolution, to report violations.
 Q: So you would consider any further firing on U.S. and British planes a new material breach?
 MR. McCLELLAN: Well, again, those matters, if they're violations, they go back to the U.N. Security Council for discussion.
 Q: Well, but we don't go back to the Security Council for definition, we just go back --
 MR. McCLELLAN: We're getting into ""ifs"" here -- but we made it clear that they need to follow that and not continue to do that.
 Q: Right, because it would be a new material breach if they were to fire?
 MR. McCLELLAN: Well, I don't have the resolution right in front of me that spells out specifically, but I'll refer you back to the resolution for that specific issue. But that is part of what Iraq needs to comply with, is not to fire on aircraft patrolling the no-fly zones.
 Q: And one other matter in the same regard -- that is, that they -- you talked about the declaration where they must fully declare any weapons of mass destruction they have. They've indicated they will say they are clean, as they said this morning. Do we consider a declaration -- since we believe they have weapons, do we consider a declaration, if they have none, to be a material breach, or must that be proven?
 MR. McCLELLAN: Well, what is considered to be a material breach is if there is false information or omissions about what they are required to disclose and to report.
 Q: And what is the proof of false information?
 MR. McCLELLAN: Well, that will be determined in discussions with the U.N. Security Council. That's what the resolution calls for.
 Q: Scott, two quick questions. One, same question yesterday, and today U.S. officials are saying -- other Bush administration officials -- that link between North Korea and Pakistan, Pakistan is the root cause of helping -- earlier, just a few months ago, and still helping North Korea in training, technology, like giving nuclear and getting missile technology.
 Now my question is that I hope President Bush is aware and reading all these think-tank and the reports and now all the cards on the table that (inaudible) Musharraf. And Musharraf is threat to the west and the United States and Israel as much as North Korea or Saddam Hussein, because (inaudible), what he calls. And, two, link with terrorists with Osama bin Laden and Taliban, and also against Israel. And their nuclear technology also I think in the hands of Osama bin Laden or his al Qaeda. So where do we stand now?
 MR. McCLELLAN: What's the question there?
 Q: The question is how do -- what -- U.S. is (inaudible) with link with the North Korea and Pakistan. What are they starting now and how -- what action, sort of action U.S. will take against Pakistan, because under U.S. law all economic and military aid must be stopped.
 MR. McCLELLAN: Well, the press has reported that a number of countries may have assisted North Korea in its efforts to develop a nuclear weapons program. I think all of those countries view how seriously we take such action and how serious we view any kind of proliferation activity that involves North Korea. And I would refer you back to Secretary Powell's comments on October 26th, where he talked about President Musharraf's assurances that Pakistan is not participating in activity of this nature.
 And I would again reiterate what I talked to you about yesterday. Pakistan has been a strong partner in the global coalition in the war against terrorism.
 Q: So there are no consequences for Pakistan having supplied North Korea with materials as recently as this past --
 MR. McCLELLAN: Well, if you go back to some of the Secretary's comments, he talked about how we are focused on now and the future. The past is the past. He -- Secretary Powell talked about that. But we will continue to follow the issue closely.
 Q: Just to follow. Former Prime Minister Pakistan is in town and she has been talking with -- meeting with U.S. officials, including the State Department. And she said that whatever pledges and commitment General Musharraf made to the United States and President Bush and the international community, he has not lived up to those pledges and he has broken all those commitments, including his government or Pakistan will be governed by the pro-Taliban and al Qaeda (inaudible), this week maybe. And she said that U.S. is making a big mistake toward Pakistan, General Musharraf policy and they must change it.
 MR. McCLELLAN: I think you have my response. I'm not aware of the details of the meeting that was had.
 David.
 Q: One question, just following up on your answer on North Korea. When you quote the Secretary of State as saying that we are focused on now and the future, of course, the law requires you, in terms of sanctions, to focus on the past. The law doesn't deal with future transactions.
 Are you suggesting there that the administration's position at this point is to ignore what happened in the past, not enforce that law?
 MR. McCLELLAN: I think I would leave it where Secretary Powell left it on October 26th, after he had discussions with President Musharraf. And specifically there, he said that President Musharraf assured him -- he said -- these are Secretary Powell's words: 400 percent assurance that there is no such interchange taking place now of any kind between Pakistan. And he was referring to now or looking ahead.
 And he said: we didn't talk about the past, we'll talk about now and the future. The past, as he said, is subject to intelligence analysis with sources and methods. And, as you know, we don't get into discussions of -- discussing those intelligence matters.
 Q: I didn't ask you to discuss -- to be --
 MR. McCLELLAN: I know, but you're asking me --
 Q: The response to -- the question is, does the administration plan to enforce the law that is on the books in this case? Or is the administration saying, no, we're only going to look at the future and not enforce the laws?
 MR. McCLELLAN: I think I addressed it by referring back to what Secretary Powell said.
 Q: Secretary Powell didn't refer to sanctions --
 MR. McCLELLAN: And I would remind you that September 11th changed the world and changed the behavior of many nations, as well. But we are looking at now and we are looking at future action, and we will continue to follow this closely.
 Q: Does September 11th mean that law is no longer in effect in terms of enforcement, is that what you're telling me?
 MR. McCLELLAN: I didn't say that, David. I think I addressed the question.
 Q: A quick question on Iraq, if I could. Is it the administration's intention -- if this letter says, as we believe it does, that there's no -- that there are no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, to provide in any public forum, to the United Nations or anybody else, some sampling of the administration's specific suspicions or evidence that, in fact, there is -- there are weapons of mass destruction?
 MR. McCLELLAN: Again, I haven't seen the contents of the letter, but stay tuned. We will work with the U.N. and provide what support we can to the inspectors. We will provide what intelligence we can, as well.
 Q: Scott, on another subject. In Nevada, 67 percent of the voters supported an initiative confining marriage to one man and one woman, while in his Florida debate with Bill McBride, Governor Jeb Bush, when asked if homosexuals should be prohibited from adopting children replied -- and this is a quote -- ""I believe they should. If you're going to have permanency, it should be with a loving couple that is man and wife."" And my question is, the President doesn't disagree with either his brother or the majority of Nevada voters, does he, Scott?
 MR. McCLELLAN: What was the statement again?
 Q: I believe -- this is what Jeb Bush, with 650,000 votes, he said when he was asked if they should be prohibited from adopting children, he said, ""I believe they should. If you're going to have permanency, it should be with a loving couple that is man and wife.""
 Now, the President doesn't disagree with his brother, does he?
 MR. McCLELLAN: I think the President's views are very clear on that issue, as well.
 Q: So he doesn't disagree. The New York Times reports this morning that the Catholic Bishop's Conference meeting here in Washington has just debated the question of whether action in Iran is a just war. In a debate presided over by Cardinal Law of Boston, whom the Times identified as ""the leader at the center of the abuse scandal,"" even as abuse victims are calling for his resignation. And my question, does the White House hope the bishops can achieve some real solution to their pedophile priest problem before making any proposal of pacifism towards Saddam Hussein?
 MR. McCLELLAN: You mentioned Iran. I think you meant Iraq when you said that earlier?
 Q: I mean Iraq, yes, you're right.
 MR. McCLELLAN: But the Catholic Church is working to address this issue, and it's important that they do. I think the President has expressed his concerns previously about the issue you referred to.
 Q: How does he feel about pacifism? How does he feel about --
 MR. McCLELLAN: And I think he's -- I think he's addressed it.
 Mark, let me go on to you.
 Q: Yes. Can I come back to Iraq letter?
 MR. McCLELLAN: Sure.
 Q: The first deadline that Saddam Hussein was supposed to meet was the Friday deadline for acceptance of the U.N. resolution. Has he now met it?
 MR. McCLELLAN: Again, I haven't seen the letter. I've seen the reports. I understand that the U.N. does have a copy of that letter. I don't know if we are in possession of a copy of that letter as well.
 But I would go back to what I said, we have heard this before from Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi regime. We need to see it in their actions. We need to see it in their actions to disarm. This is about disarmament, and it's going to require actions, not just words.
 Q: You haven't even seen enough of the letter to say whether it's --
 MR. McCLELLAN: I haven't seen the letter before I came out here. All the reports were happening just before I came out here.
 Dick.
 Q: I'd like to go back to David's issue for a moment, and that is deficits. What level --
 MR. McCLELLAN: David Sanger or David Gregory?
 Q: The esteemed Mr. Gregory.
 Q: Clearly mine. (Laughter.)
 MR. McCLELLAN: Esteemed? (Laughter.)
 Q: What acceptable level of deficits does the President envision? The reason I ask is that most forecasters you talk to either in New York or around town here think that we're talking about a minimum of $200 billion for most of the rest of the decade, if not all of it. And those calculations don't even take into account the possibility that we'll have some nation-building costs associated with whatever happens in Iraq. So their estimates are caveated with the expectation that, indeed, the sum is likely to go higher and perhaps far higher. And that's before --
 MR. McCLELLAN: I don't try to forecast budgets or forecast economic outlook.
 Q: But those that do think that there are some very, very hard choices to make, unless the President is willing to accept deficits north of $200 billion for the foreseeable future. How does that fit into his calculations?
 MR. McCLELLAN: I think it goes back to what I said earlier, that we need to get -- continue to keep the economy growing and take additional steps, some that the President has already outlined, some that he is going to work with Congress on to move early next year. And it goes back to the point I made, that surpluses don't create growth, growth creates surpluses. So that's the importance of getting the economy growing.
 And at the same time as we're taking additional steps to stimulate the economy, we need to show fiscal restraint. We need to fund our important prioritIes -- homeland security, the war on terrorism. And then we need to work to hold the line on spending elsewhere. There are a number of priorities within that -- David mentioned Medicare and prescription drug coverage, that's an important priority, as well.
 But if we fund our priorities and hold the line on spending elsewhere, the President believes we can get us back on that path.
 Q: If he is to achieve these things, and to fund a prescription drug benefit, realistically, where are the cuts going to have to come from? Everyone knows they're going to have to be cut. Where are they going to come from?
 MR. McCLELLAN: Well, again, I don't have the whole budget here in front of me. But, I mean, those discussions are going on now. Congress still needs to act. As you know, they've only passed two of the appropriations bills, two of the 13 appropriations bills. Congress still needs to get it done, and we are working with Congress.
 But the most important thing they need to do as they're working to get this done is to show fiscal restraint while they're funding our priorities.
 Q: Scott, coming back to homeland security bill, if I can. You've received some assurances that there will not be a filibuster, some Democrats have assured the White House that that won't take place. However, amid the revelation that the provision that would create the 9/11 commission has been stripped out of the Senate vote, there is some talk about a potential filibuster now. What is the White House going to do to try and avert that from happening, given the fact that the commission had a provision --
 MR. McCLELLAN: I understand that's not part of the legislation that is moving in the House --
 Q: Right. But it had been part of the Senate legislation and it's obviously not there now.
 MR. McCLELLAN: And the President remains committed to a strong bipartisan 9/11 commission. It's important to let them look at a broad range of issues and build upon the work that's already been completed by the intelligence committees. And he remains committed to that.
 Q: So what is the White House going to do, are you going to propose there to be --
 MR. McCLELLAN: That's an issue we're still talking with members about. As you know, there are a couple of issues that remain to be resolved and we're trying to get those issues resolved.
 Q: Does he want that done before the end of the year?
 MR. McCLELLAN: We're working with members on it. I didn't put a time line on it; it's something that's important and we continue to work with members on. We've had a number of discussions with families, as well.
 Q: Scott, the Osama bin Laden tape -- anything new to report on authenticity? And, two, could you characterize for us what the President's reaction has been to that tape?
 MR. McCLELLAN: Well, I think the President's reaction was spelled out in his remarks in the Cabinet Room. Again, the analysis is ongoing. As the President said, the experts are looking at it, they continue to look at it. There's nothing I have to confirm here right now. But obviously, as he said earlier today, any time we hear a tape like this, where someone, no matter who it is, threatens the world -- not just the United States, several countries were mentioned, individuals were mentioned, countries such as Britain, France, Italy, Jordan, Russia, Indonesia, just to name a few -- there are other countries, as well, that were threatened in that tape.
 We take that very seriously. And it is a reminder that we are at war on terrorism. It is a reminder of why we have a global coalition of some 90 countries that are working together to win that war on terrorism. We have disrupted the terrorist network, but we are continuing to hunt down the terrorists wherever they are. And we know that there are thousands of trained killers in some 60 countries, and we will not stop until we have tracked them all down, until we have stopped this threat.
 Q: Does the White House consider this a setback in the war on terrorism if it were to be found that this is, indeed, Osama bin Laden on that tape?
 MR. McCLELLAN: I think the President mentioned earlier that the war on terrorism -- that we are making tremendous progress in the war on terrorism. There is obviously more to do, but this war on terrorism is about more than any one person.
 As I just mentioned, there are some 60 countries where terrorists, thousands of trained killers, are residing. And we are going to continue the best way -- the best way to protect the American people. We are taking steps here at home by creating the Department of Homeland Security and taking other measures to protect the infrastructure and protect the American people. And that's important. But the best way to protect the American people and win this war on terrorism is to go after those killers wherever they are -- those killers who want to carry out attacks on the United States, on our friends and allies and on the international community. And we're going to continue working to hunt them down and bring them to justice or bring justice to them.
 Ken.
 Q: Let me take the last question and turn it around a bit, if I may. Did that tape in some ways make that United States's job easier, in terms of shoring up the international coalition against terrorism by tying together in a nice, pretty package the Bali bombing, the Moscow theater incident, the Yemen incident, all the countries that you mentioned, the threats against so many countries. Does that make it easier to shore up that --
 MR. McCLELLAN: It's clearly, as the President said, a reminder to the world of why we are waging this war on terrorism. It's clearly a reminder of the types of threats we face in the 21st century. That's why we're going to continue working with our coalition partners to hunt these people down wherever they are.
 Q: Does the fact that the tape mentions rather prominently the Moscow theater incident, does that -- does that lend support to President Putin's longtime assertion that Russia's war in Chechnya is part of the war on terror?
 MR. McCLELLAN: Well, as you know, we support a political solution in Chechnya and that's our position. As far as the -- what exactly is within the tape, there is analysis ongoing. But we have made our position pretty clear when it comes to Chechnya.
 Q: -- any support to make these assertions at all?
 MR. McCLELLAN: Well, again, when you were asking in the context of Chechnya, I said we support a political solution there. That's our position.
 But we are going to work with our global coalition partners to fight terrorism wherever it exists.
 Q: Will you step up efforts to find bin Laden, given the likelihood now that he has survived the Afghan war?
 MR. McCLELLAN: We have and we continue to go after the terrorist networks and their leaders, wherever they are. If there is information that comes to light, we will pursue that information. But, again, this is about more than any one man. This war on terrorism is about going after the terrorists and their networks -- they exist all across the world -- and bringing them to justice.
 Q: Scott, on the 9/11 commission again. If the White House really does want this commission, why not negotiate it as part of this bill, which is basically a White House brokered compromise? Why take it out? And especially since members of Congress seem to be --
 MR. McCLELLAN: There are still some issues that remain to be resolved --
 Q: Right, but why not negotiate --
 MR. McCLELLAN: -- with the 9/11 commission. We want -- and as the President talked about last week, the number one priority for this lame duck session is to get the Department of Homeland Security bill passed, so that we can move forward, get it up and running as soon as we possibly can.
 The 911 commission -- again, I mean, those are issues that are still being worked through, still being discussed with members, and with families of victims of well. And they're important issues. But the President supports a strong bipartisan commission.
 Q: When this bill is passed, what's your latest estimate of how long it will take to actually have a new department up and running?
 MR. McCLELLAN: Oh, I don't know that I -- I don't know that I could predict that at this point. It's going to take some time to get certain parts of it up and running. But we want to move as quickly as possible to begin that process. That's why they need to go and act now, get this to the President's bill [sic], so we can start moving on it quickly and get it up and running.
 Q: You have no estimate -- a year?
 MR. McCLELLAN: Well, some parts of it may take time. But we will move as quickly as we can to begin that process. We already are making preparations, if that department is passed by the Congress.
 Q: Scott, you said earlier that Secretary Mineta was going to brief at the meeting, Cabinet meeting today about the TSA. Is it the administration's feeling that the deadlines for bomb detection equipment and the other airport precautions are going to be met by the end of the year? Is there any consideration of an extension?
 MR. McCLELLAN: I think Secretary Mineta addressed it, not only in the news reports that were in today's papers, but he addressed it in the Cabinet meeting as well. He said that we're committed to meeting the congressional deadline. So I understand there is some discussion going on that in Congress, but he made it clear that -- and we've made a tremendous amount of progress. But we are committing to meeting the congressional deadline.
 Q: Scott, I know you have, and appreciate the fact that you haven't read the letter, but separate and apart from that, based on the President's own public statements over the last couple of months, is it the President's position that Iraq does in fact have chemical and biological weapons, and is pursuing nuclear weapons?
 MR. McCLELLAN: That's a good question. We have made that clear, that Iraq does possess chemical and biological weapons. And what we are doing is to -- what we are working to do right now with the international community, speaking with one voice, is to disarm Saddam Hussein of those weapons of mass destruction. We know that he possesses chemical and biological weapons. And we know that he seeks to acquire nuclear weapons.
 Q: And that said, what sort of a foundation for cooperation is laid by a statement that these weapons don't exist?
 MR. McCLELLAN: Well, again, you're asking me to comment about a letter that I have not seen. The resolution, I go back to that, says they have a 30-day time period to disclose all information. So that's what I would refer you back to.
 Q: On Israel and terrorism, will the United States aid Israel in any way in its investigation of this horrendous murder in the kibbutz of the women and her two children, because of this eerie coincidence or relationship, the fact that the killer was Sirhan Sirhan, the cousin of the Sirhan Sirhan who is in American custody?
 MR. McCLELLAN: I don't have any information on that, Connie. I might refer you to the State Department. What specific --
 Q: Well, since Sirhan Sirhan who killed Kennedy is in American custody, and the 19 year old who killed the woman and the two children is also named Sirhan Sirhan and is a cousin. I'm just wondering if there is any possibility of a relationship with it?
 MR. McCLELLAN: I just don't have any information on this.
 Let me get April.
 Q: Scott, on another issue from the news conference last week, President Bush talked about Pickering and Owens in the Senate committee, Judiciary Committee. What is the work right now that's happening on that process with them to make it through and to actually --
 MR. McCLELLAN: I'm glad you brought that up. I understand Congress is moving on a couple of the nominations. The President has made it very clear that the voice of the entire Senate deserves to be heard on his nominees. There are far too many vacancies in the judiciary and far too many very qualified individuals who have been held up, their nominations have been held up. And that's why the President said the voice of the entire Senate needs to be heard. There are currently 18 pending court of appeals nominees being held up, almost all of whom have received very strong bipartisan support. So we urge Congress to -- urge the Senate to allow those nominees to be voted on, on the floor.
 Q: You're vocally urging from the podium, but what has the President done since the news conference in talking about what could be done for these nominees?
 MR. McCLELLAN: I think the White House staff continues to work with Congress to move these nominees forward. We work very closely with them on an individual basis. I would also point out -- I would also point out on nominations that there are over -- this is beyond just judicial nominees -- there are over 95 nominations awaiting floor action, and over 150 nominations awaiting committee and floor action. And it's important that Congress move forward on those nominees, as well, so that we have people in place to carry out their responsibilities.
 Thank you.

George W. Bush,"November 15, 2002",Press Briefing by Dr. Rice on the President's Trip to the NATO Summit,"James S. Brady Press Briefing Room
10:30 A.M. EST
DR. RICE: I'm going to open with a brief overview of the President's upcoming trip to Europe for the NATO summit and for other meetings, and then I'll be happy to take your questions.
There are three major items on the agenda at the NATO summit in Prague. First, NATO will, for the second time since the end of the Cold War, welcome new members. This is an historic event for Europe and for the Transatlantic Alliance, as Europe continues to move closer to realizing the vision of a continent that is whole, free, and at peace.
President Bush has long maintained America's commitment to a strong NATO alliance and to a robust expansion of NATO, a point that he made dramatically in his speech at Warsaw when he said that the Alliance should do as much as possible, not as little. And I think you will see that at the NATO summit that charge has been taken up.
Second, NATO members will work to advance the task of transforming NATO. The end of the Cold War has meant the end of the Cold War threat of massive armies contending for the Central European plains. And all NATO members today face common threats from terrorists and the states that sponsor them. These threats require a different kind of military force to defend against, a force that is lighter, more agile, and more flexible. NATO members are working to transform their forces to meet new threats and to increase the ability of our forces to work together.
Third, we will make further progress in building a new relationship with Russia. This summit and this round of expansion will be further evidence of America's and Europe's new strategic relationship with Russia, which is formalized in agreements such as the Moscow Treaty and the NATO-Russia Council. An alliance founded to wage the Cold War will once again show how far it has come since that task was completed.
The President and Mrs. Bush will depart Washington on Tuesday morning, arriving in Prague that evening. On Wednesday, the President will hold five bilateral meetings with Czech President Havel, Czech Prime Minister Spidla, with President Sezer of Turkey, President Chirac of France, and NATO Secretary General Lord Robertson. At each of the meetings the President will discuss NATO issues, Iraq, the war on terrorism, and bilateral matters.
Later that afternoon, the President will deliver remarks at the Prague Atlantic Students Summit, where he will discuss his vision of a Europe whole, free and at peace.
On Thursday, the President will attend several working sessions of the NATO summit, and an announcement of the countries to be invited into NATO will be made on Thursday.
On Friday, the President travels to St. Petersburg, Russia, where he will meet with President Putin. The two Presidents will discuss a host of issues, including Russia's emerging relationship with NATO.
President Bush will leave Russia for Vilnius, Lithuania on Friday evening. And on Saturday, the President will hold a bilateral meeting with the President of Lithuania, as well as a joint meeting with the Presidents of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
The President will then travel to Bucharest, Romania, where he will meet with Romanian President Iliescu, and make remarks to the Romanian people at a square in central Bucharest. President and Mrs. Bush will return to Washington on Saturday evening.
And now I'm happy to take your questions. Ron.
Q As the President prepares to head overseas, Americans are being warned again about potential threats at this time by the FBI, saying that al Qaeda is planing a spectacular attack that could involve massive casualties. Just for the record, what could Americans do about this, and is there any intelligence pointing to a specific time, place or method?
DR. RICE: The warnings that have gone out recently really are a summary of intelligence, not a new warning. This is a summary of intelligence as we know it.
It is important that Americans know when this sort of thing comes to the attention of the administration. We would ask Americans to do what the President has asked them a number of times to do, which is remain vigilant, because the American people are, in many ways, the first line of defense. There have been many cases in which Americans who were alert to suspicious circumstances around them have been able to tip law enforcement officials.
I will say that a lot is being done to bring additional protective measures, particularly to critical infrastructure locations around the United States. There is a very active now program of coordination on this particular period of time with both public and private entities, and at the federal, state and local areas -- local levels. And we are raising protective measures in a number of placed around the country. But there are not specifics, Ron, as to time, date or, for that matter, very much about how this might carry out. So we think this is what we need to do at this point.
Q Dr. Rice, because of these warnings, critics have suggested that the administration is focused too much on the war, or possibility of war against Iraq, and not enough on the terrorism threat at home. And ordinary citizens continue to ask, why go after Iraq now if we have this unfinished problem right here at home?
DR. RICE: Well, let me start by saying that the President begins his day at 8:00 a.m. in the morning with the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, joined shortly after that by my colleague Tom Ridge, and the FBI Director, and his counterterrorism person to review the counter -- the terrorism threats to the United States. He does not begin his day on Iraq. He begins his day on the war on terrorism and the threat levels, and the threat information that we have about the United States. This is a central focus of this administration.
And the war on terrorism, as the President said back on September 20th when he addressed the Congress, is being fought on many fronts. It is a war that is many times being fought in the shadows, so that it's not always on television screens. Yes, it is different than the early phases of the war when we were in a large-scale military operation in Afghanistan. But we should focus our attention also on how much disruption of al Qaeda there has been.
There have been a number of -- numerous senior leaders of al Qaeda that have either been eliminated, incarcerated, or detained someplace. One of the reasons that we have different sources of information that we did not have is that we have some of those people in custody who are informing us about how al Qaeda operates, about what various things might mean. This is a war on terrorism that is going to be ongoing for a long time, but that is being fought very aggressively and will continue to be fought very aggressively.
That said, it is also the case that the worst nightmare that we would face is the combination of extremism with a hostile regime armed with weapons of mass destruction. And the President has made very clear that he believes the Iraqi regime is a regime that, both through its efforts to acquire weapons of mass destruction and its long-known support for terrorism, is a potential threat for exactly that nexus. And so Iraq is a part of the war on terrorism. But the part of the war on terrorism that is going after al Qaeda and disrupting and trying to protect the country is fought aggressively every day, every hour by this administration and that's how the President begins his day.
Q Dr. Rice, are you looking for a statement of support from the NATO meeting on Iraq? And are you looking for a military commitment? If not, why not?
DR. RICE: This is a summit that is going to celebrate an historic moment for NATO, which is the expansion of NATO into territories that I think nobody ever thought NATO would expand into. And that is really the central purpose of this summit. It is also the central purpose of this summit to talk about how to improve NATO's capabilities to deal with the threats that we face today.
Now, of course, we expect that Iraq will be discussed and, of course, the President will discuss Iraq in bilaterals and probably in the NATO Council, as well. But there is a lot of work that has already gone on and is already going on in terms of coalition building for Iraq. We now have a U.N. Security Council resolution that is 15 to 0, so it's not just NATO that is united about what to do about Saddam Hussein, it's the entire world that is united.
I suspect that we will hear from NATO partners what they are prepared to do and what they can do, but that's not the purpose of this summit. The purpose of this summit is to invite new members in, to celebrate NATO's future, and to talk about how far NATO has come and how it remains a vital and viable alliance some 11 years after the end of the Cold War.
Q So you're not expecting some sort of statement of support?
DR. RICE: Well, there will undoubtedly be discussion of this and there probably will be statements about it. But that's not the central purpose of this meeting. But I assume that there will be some kind of statement from NATO about this.
Q Dr. Rice, why is it necessary for the United States Air Force to control the airspace above Prague, to secure Prague during the summit? What does that say about the capabilities gap within NATO? And in what way will that gap be addressed at this summit?
DR. RICE: Let's remember that the United States is, of course, a member of NATO. And so whatever assets the United States can lend to protection of NATO during the NATO summit, it's perfectly appropriate for the United States to do that. One of the things that we will discuss at the summit is how to think about getting new capabilities for NATO members. You will have very -- a lot of small members of NATO, for instance, for the first time. And they cannot -- across the entire range of military capabilities -- contribute. But they can contribute in specific ways, in niche ways to the overall military capability of NATO. So that will be discussed.
The truth of the matter is that everybody is having to reassess capabilities at this time. Everybody is having to make a transformation. This isn't just something that NATO and the Europeans are having to do. The United States, itself, is having to make a transformation and having to assess capabilities. And I think you will see that this is an issue that the NATO Alliance takes seriously, that member states take seriously, and that we will make some progress on exactly this.
Q -- the question of financial commitment?
DR. RICE: Some of it is certainly a question of financial commitment. But it's also a question of getting the mission right and determining what capabilities you really need.
Q Dr. Rice, what can you say about what you and your colleagues have learned about how al Qaeda is operating now? And if the presumption is that Osama bin Laden is still alive, is he playing the same role that he's played in the past as sort of the brains and the person who sets into motion any plots?
DR. RICE: David, I don't think that we can be certain of what role Osama bin Laden is or is not playing. What we have to assume is that whatever al Qaeda is doing in terms of command and control has to be different than what it was doing before because they don't have the home base in Afghanistan. And that is a good thing.
We, obviously, also are working harder in an international fashion to disrupt their activities than we were prior to 9/11. We just simply have a much more -- a much larger umbrella of intelligence and law enforcement, a much more coordinated effort of law enforcement and intelligence than the world has seen ever on any target. And so that is another factor in disrupting and making it hard to operate. But, of course, it is adaptable. It's an adaptable organization. We have to assume that it's trying to adapt.
Our goal has to be to, every day with our partners around the world, take as much information as we possibly can, assess it and try to respond to it. And that is what we do on a daily basis. The al Qaeda operations in Afghanistan were destroyed. Another piece of this is to make sure that there are not other places that they can puddle, or other places that they can gain the kind of foothold that they did in Afghanistan. And that's why you see us working with countries like Yemen or with Philippines or Indonesia to try and keep that from happening.
Q Can I just follow on one point? Assuming that people you have in custody may provide some sort of guidance on plots that may have been discussed at some point in the past, isn't it difficult because the organization seems to become more decentralized now, to fight it? Are you working on the assumption that where it can puddle together, then plots that were discussed before might ultimately come to fruition?
DR. RICE: Well, David, without getting into too great a detail here, what you have to do is to recognize that there are going to be adaptations that they will make and there are adaptations that we will make, and that we do have the advantage of having in custody people who can talk about the operation, who can talk about how various people were involved in various operations. That's all very helpful to all of us.
But in many places in the world, law enforcement and intelligence are working together in ways that they have not in the past. And I would just emphasize to you the importance of having this as a kind of worldwide activity, not just one that the United States is loosely engaged in.
Q Dr. Rice, some of us had been told by people here that the President would actually make a speech on Iraq during this meeting, and that it would probably be the Wednesday speech. Has that now been changed? Do you expect --
DR. RICE: The Wednesday speech? In Prague?
Q Yes.
DR. RICE: The President is going to talk about NATO in Prague, and about Europe's future.
Q He's not going to make a pitch -- about Iraq?
DR. RICE: The President will have an opportunity, when he's with his colleagues, to talk about a number of challenges, one of which is Iraq. But the plan for the President's major address is to talk about the future of Europe.
Q Could you just talk about what you expect -- what course you expect conversations with Putin to take and what role you think Chechnya will play in those conversations, where -- what the President wants?
DR. RICE: Let me just -- going back to the point about Iraq, let me put it in context. Iraq is typical or the most important example of the kind of threat that NATO will face in the future. So it would be odd if this were not an issue at the summit. But it is not the reason for this summit.
In terms of the discussions with President Putin, I think you will -- obviously, we expect to discuss Chechnya in the following way -- recognizing that terrorism can never be a legitimate method for any cause. And the President has said that to President Putin. He said it to him when the Moscow events took place.
We still believe that the best way to resolve this situation is through a political solution that can take care of legitimate aspirations of the Chechen people, recognizing that Chechnya is a part of Russia, but recognizing that this is a part of Russia in which there are ethnic groups that have particular aspirations and cultural ties. And so I think they will talk about that during their meetings. I would be surprised if they did not.
Yes, a follow-up?
Q A follow-up. You once suggested that the difference about the situation in Chechnya is that because this underlying political problem, where you don't have that underlying political problem with al Qaeda or with other terrorist groups. First off, President Putin does not agree with that. He says -- he reminds that -- did pose political demands. But even in a broader sense, in Afghanistan, you used force for a political change of regime. In Iraq you are using blunt force for a political change in regime. So why the double standard?
DR. RICE: There's not a double standard here. Terrorism is wrong, wherever it is. Whether it is practiced in Chechnya or in the streets of Moscow or in New York or in Berlin, terrorism is wrong. And the President has been clearer about that than anyone. He's also been clear in trying to help, for instance, the Georgians to deal with terrorist elements in their country that could be contributing to this problem.
That said, political circumstances need to be dealt with, and I believe President Putin himself has said from time to time that, of course, Moscow would like to find a political solution to the Chechen circumstances. And so it is a particular history, it's different than a lot of other histories, but it does need a political solution. That does not excuse the fact that terrorism cannot be used in any cause.
MR. MCCORMACK: Let's make this the last question.
Q Could we make the last two? I have a couple. (Laughter.) First of all, what can you point to to show the American people success in the war against terrorism, given constant warnings of threat and warnings by very senior administration officials that we could face an attack with casualties of a scale much larger than we saw on September 11th?
And, second, how can you show the American people that the threat -- the description of Iraq as part of the war against terrorism is not a simple convenience, given that the war against terrorism is politically popular, and it is very difficult for people to see a connection between Saddam Hussein and al Qaeda that even senior intelligence officials question?
DR. RICE: We know one thing about bad guys -- they tend to travel in packs. They do tend to help each other, they do tend to coalesce around issues. Saddam Hussein has a long terrorist past. Whether it is in support of Palestinian rejectionists or the Abu Nidal organization, or helping some al Qaeda operatives gain training in CBRN, or having meetings with -- between Iraqis and al Qaeda in various parts of the world, there's a relationship here.
Nobody has said that he has operational control of al Qaeda or that he caused September 11th, that's not the point. But the point is, if you look at a regime like Iraq, with a growing -- growing capabilities in terms of weapons of mass destruction and with an extreme animus toward the United States, and you look at the potential for that to link up with terrorist organizations, including with al Qaeda, you have to be concerned about that. And it is important to take account of what the Iraqi regime is doing and to deal with it, both because of that, and because you do not want Saddam Hussein, who is a homicidal dictator, armed with a nuclear weapon in the Middle East, which is the most volatile region of the world.
So the President has been very clear about his reasons for insisting on action toward Saddam Hussein. Terrorism is a piece of it, but so is the ambition and behavior of Saddam Hussein, because sooner or later the ambitions of Saddam Hussein and the interests of the United States are going to clash. And let's remember that this is somebody who isn't a status quo power; he is active in his policy.
In terms of the first question, I would just remind the American people that it took a while for al Qaeda to become the organization that it is; it took a while for them to lodge themselves in 60 countries around the world, including the United States; it took a while for them to become an effective organization. It's going to take a while to break them up.
We have a lot going for us and we've mobilized a great deal. You have now what you have never had before, which is the attention of intelligence and law enforcement organizations all over the world on these extremist activities of organizations like al Qaeda and their brethren. You have constant coordination and reporting and integration of everything that -- of what is know worldwide about them and activities to disrupt them. We didn't have that prior to September 11th; we have that in place now.
We have locked up or detained or eliminated important al Qaeda leaders. We have eliminated their base in Afghanistan so they cannot operate in the way that they have in the past. We have strengthened the resolve and the capacity of countries like Yemen and the Philippines and countries in Africa to deal with this threat. A lot has been done.
But I would also remind people that on September 20th, the President told everyone that this was going to be a long struggle, not a short one, that a lot of the victories would be won in the shadows. And victories are won every day. When a cell is disrupted in Buffalo, or when something is broken up in Singapore, or broken up in Germany, those are victories in the war on terrorism.
But the President has been very clear that he is going to lead this country in a way that shows perseverance and tirelessness and resolve, which is what you have to do when you're dealing with an organization that has been around for a while and that has managed to penetrate into a lot of places -- going to take time.
Q One NATO question?
DR. RICE: Yes, a NATO question. (Laughter.) There's a concept. Yes, sure.
Q If the U.S.-German relationship is central to NATO, as many people believe, what plans are there, if any, for the President and Mr. Schroeder to meet and talk?
DR. RICE: I'm sure they will see each other at NATO. As you know, they talked by phone about a week ago. Look, the relationship with Germany is very important and it will work and continue to work to the benefit of both countries. The Germans are preparing to try to become the next lead nation in the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan. That's extremely important. And so we are working with the Germans and will continue to.
We have very good counterterrorism cooperation, for instance, with the Germans -- that every day is important to our efforts to disrupt al Qaeda and to disrupt organizations around the world. So, yes, it's an important relationship, and it's going to continue to work. And I'm sure that the Chancellor and the President will see each other at the summit, though they won't -- there's no formal meeting planned.
Q But why is there no scheduled bilateral meeting with the two?
DR. RICE: There are scheduled bilaterals with very few people at the NATO summit, and --
Q If Germany is so important?
DR. RICE: There are a lot of very important countries with which we're not having bilaterals at the NATO summit.
Q Yes, and on Germany, can I ask your assessment -- Germany has, in its recent elections, essentially taken it out of any participation in any military action in Iraq, even one sanctioned under Chapter 7 by the United Nations. What is your assessment of what that does to Germany's credibility in a defensive alliance, military alliance like NATO, when it won't assume its responsibilities, even under the U.N. Charter and Chapter 7?
DR. RICE: Well, this is for Germans to decide and for the German government to decide, what role Germany can play. I would note that this is a U.N. Security Council resolution that has the backing of everybody in the world, including Syria. And I'm quite certain that the members of NATO, all of them, are supportive of trying to work to make sure that the U.N. Security Council resolution is carried out.
But let's be realistic; the Germans have done a lot in Afghanistan, in the war on terrorism there, in counterterrorism. We appreciate that very much. As I said, they're preparing to take leadership of the ISAF. That's going to be a tremendous contribution. But Germany will have to decide what role it can and cannot play to enforce U.N. Security Council resolutions if that's necessary.
Thank you very much.

George W. Bush,"November 18, 2002",Interview With Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty,"Coalition Against Iraq
Q. Mr. President, this week NATO will be celebrating an historic expansion as well as focusing on transforming the Alliance to meet new threats, such as Iraq. You have spoken about the possibility of leading a coalition of the willing against Iraq. Why not speak about using NATO forces against Iraq, since under NATO's charter all members are supposed to come to the aid of any member under direct threat?
The President. Well, first of all, I hope we can do this peacefully. And by doing it peacefully, that means I hope Saddam Hussein disarms. Of course, we've hoped that for 11 years. We've hoped that for 16 resolutions. We now have a 17th resolution, and this time I intend to work with nations that love freedom and peace, make sure the resolution stands. And if he doesn't disarm, you're right, I'll lead a coalition of the willing to disarm him. And there's all kinds of ways for that coalition to be formed. It could be formed with NATO, if they choose. I have said to the U.N. Security Council, ""We'll go back and discuss the matter with you."" But Mr. Saddam Hussein must understand he'll be disarmed one way or the other. I hope it's done peacefully.
NATO and the War on Terror
Q. The new members of NATO are quite small. Do you see them as contributing something significant militarily to the Alliance?
The President. I was hoping you'd ask, do I see them contributing something to the Alliance, so I'm going to answer it that way. First, I'll answer it militarily, because I do believe they can contribute something really important, and that is, they can contribute their love for freedom. These are countries which have lived in totalitarian states. They haven't been free. And now they've seen freedom and they love freedom, just like America loves freedom. And that's going to be a really important—it will add some vigor to the relationship in NATO that's healthy and wholesome.
And I think they will. The key is to— I think they will help militarily—but the key is to change the military strategy of NATO. Lord Robertson understands this. It starts with the understanding that Russia is not our enemy. NATO doesn't need to be constructed to prevent the Warsaw Pact from invading Europe. After all, the Warsaw Pact doesn't exist. As a matter of fact, the Warsaw Pact is becoming NATO, slowly but surely. We don't need that type of mentality, and we've got to have a military strategy that addresses the true threats.
The threats we face are global terrorist attacks. That's the threat. And the more you love freedom, the more likely it is you'll be attacked. And therefore, the Article 5 that you referred to for NATO becomes very relevant in this war against terror. The war against terror will not only be defeated—the terrorists will not only be defeated militarily, but the terrorists will be defeated as we share intelligence and as we cut off money and as we deny access and as we stiffen up border requirements in order to make sure that people can't go from one spot to another with plots and/or messages to attack.
And so it's a different kind of war. And it's going to be an interesting meeting, because not only is the meeting going to expand, but the meeting is going to address how best to achieve this common objective. I'm absolutely convinced that the so-called military gap between America and all countries can be addressed with a good strategy. And that will be interesting for observers to watch. I think it's going to happen. I know that Lord Robertson, who runs NATO, is committed to developing a relevant strategy and one that will work.
Chechnya/War on Terror
Q. Russian President Vladimir Putin has equated his war in Chechnya with the U.S. war on terrorism. Do you agree with that equation, or do you still feel, as was stated during your election campaign, that Russian forces are committing brutalities against innocent Chechen civilians?
The President. I think that Russia should be able to—or hope that Russia should be able to solve their issue with Chechnya peacefully. That's not to say that Vladimir shouldn't do what it takes to protect his people from individual terrorist attacks. But this is a different kind of war that we face. This is a war where we're dealing with people who hide in caves and kind of shadowy corners of the world and send people to their suicidal deaths. It's a war that I believe can lend itself both to chasing those people down and, at the same time, solving issues in a peaceful way, with respect for the human rights of minorities within countries. I said that in the campaign. I also say it to Mr. Putin every time I see him.
NATO-Russia Partnership
Q. Do you envision Russia ever becoming a full-fledged member of NATO?
The President. I think the partnership between NATO and Russia is going to be a very constructive partnership. We'll see. Time will tell. The key thing is to make sure the relationship works the way it should, which really says to Russia that a expanded NATO on your border is not a threat to you or your future. As a matter of fact, it should enable you to grow peacefully.
I'm going from Prague to St. Petersburg precisely to deliver that message to the Russian people, that even though NATO will have been expanded on your border, particularly in sensitive areas like the Baltics, you should not fear expansion, you should welcome expansion, because you've now got a neighborhood that is much more peaceful for you to—in which to realize your vast potential. And that's important for Russia to hear.
Q. Russia now has a special council with NATO——
The President. Are we getting the hook already?
Q. Does that mean we're running out of time? Let me ask you another question——
The President. It's hard to see on radio.
Freedom and the War on Terror
Q. Central Asia—we broadcast to Central Asia. And many experts say that the authoritarian regimes in that region are actually fueling terrorism because their people feel helpless and unable to effect change. Do you think there are any dangers in the U.S. allying itself closely with those governments that are——
The President. I think anytime the United States allies itself with a government, that we never forget the basic premises of our existence, and that is: Freedom is important; the human condition for all are important; we value every life; everybody counts. And in my judgment, the more people relate to the United States and work with the United States, the more likely it is they will work to improve the human condition. And that's what we spend a lot of time doing. That's one of the great things about our country is that we embrace freedom, first and foremost.
It's one of my concerns about Iraq. Listen, we've got people living in Iraq that are tortured and brutalized in order to keep this man in power. I weep for those who suffer.
And so the great cause of the United States is freedom. I tell these countries— they talk about freedom—I say, ""Freedom isn't America's gift to the world. It's God-given. Everybody counts."" And it is with— that spirit of recognizing the values of freedom I think will help improve people, no matter where. And you're right, there's some leaders there that need work with, and we're prepared to work with them.
But I will tell you, people—poverty is a tool for recruitment amongst these global terrorists. It's a way for them to recruit, perhaps. But poverty doesn't cause killers to exist. And it's an important distinction to make. These global terrorists are—some of them are rich, monetarily. They're obviously poor in spirit. They have no regard for human life. They claim they're religious, and they kill in the name of religion. And there are some breeding grounds, no question about it. And therefore, we hope that prosperity spreads out from central government to help people. But I hope people don't confuse the mentality of the terrorist leaders and economic plight, because these people are plenty comfortable. They just kill. And we're going to get them before they get us. And that's what the world needs to know about the United States.
Usama bin Laden
Q. Usama bin Laden still seems to be alive. Are you——
The President. Could be.
Q. ——worried that he's plotting another major attack on the United States?
The President. Whether it's him or somebody else, they're plotting an attack, no question about it. That's why we've got to get them. But this issue is bigger than one person. If—the war on terror is a group of fanatics. They hate America because of what we stand for. They hate us because we love freedom. And that's why we're on the hunt. And slowly but surely, we're dismantling them.
I told the people of this country it's going to take a while. I said it's going to be patient—the farther we get away from September the 11th, 2001, the more people are going to tend to forget what took place in this country. And it's normal reaction for people to just kind of try to settle back and hope that something doesn't exist. But my job is to remind people of the threats we face, based upon facts, and to find these killers. And that's exactly what we're going to do. As I tell people in America, there's no cave dark enough to hide from the justice of America and our friends.
And my speech I'm going to give in Prague to the youngsters there, I'm going to remind them there is a coalition of the willing in place right now, chasing down terror. We've got 90 nations—90 different nations—all teamed up, doing everything we can to bring these people to justice. And we'll prevail. Make no mistake about it. We'll prevail.
Thank you, sir.
Q. Thank you, sir.
The President. Is there any doubt in your mind we'll prevail?
Q. Not anymore. [Laughter]",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-radio-free-europeradio-liberty
George W. Bush,"November 18, 2002",Interview With LNK TV of Lithuania,"President's Upcoming Visit to Lithuania
Q. Mr. President, you are the first President of the United States to visit Lithuania. What is your message to Lithuania's people?
The President. Well, first, I'm honored to be invited. Secondly, I'm really looking forward to it. And my message is: You're free. Freedom is precious, and we welcome our friends the Lithuanians into the—as a free nation into the brotherhood of nations.
I'll also say to the world that the Baltic countries know what it means to live under fear and the lack of freedom, and to have these countries be allied with the United States and other nations is important to our soul. It's important to have that sense of freedom as a source of vigor and strength, and a very important alliance. That's what I want to say.
War on Terror
Q. What are America and Lithuania going to do after the Prague, together?
The President. Well, we're going to work to fight terror. That's the new threat we face. It's most evident here in America because we've been under attack, and we're still under attack. People still want to hurt us because of what we stand for. But countries which love freedom are not immune from these people. These are coldblooded killers, and we've got a charge to keep for a long time coming. And the best way to do that is work together.
So the NATO mission is one of defending freedom by fighting against those who would try to defeat freedom, which means we've got to share intelligence, work together militarily in a way that complements everybody, cut off the money of the terrorists. I mean, there's a lot to do. But that's the true threat that we face.
Russia is no longer a threat. After Prague, I'm going to Russia. And I'm going to say to the Russian people, ""You shouldn't fear expansion of NATO to your border. These are peace-loving people. These are freedom-loving people that are now on your border. You ought to welcome them. It should help Russian security""— that the cold war is over, that the United States doesn't view Russia as a threat and neither does NATO. So we've got to address our sights to the new threats.
Russia-U.S. Relations
Q. Relationship between Western democracies and Russia seems to be very friendly. But do you really trust President Putin?
The President. Sure, of course. I press any leader that doesn't believe 100 percent in freedom, and of course I do—I'm—freedom of the press or Chechnya or issues that indicate that there might not be a whole-hearted commitment to freedom of the people. I do it in a way that's a friendly way. I believe the best way to work together is to do it in a spirit of cooperation. I believe the best way to make sure we've got good relations is to make it clear that there's no animosity. But of course I do. I work very closely with him. Russia is an important country.
And we want Russia to be a country based upon the values which we share, because we believe those values are the best values for the human condition of everybody. I like to tell people, freedom is not an American gift; freedom is a gift from the almighty God. And I firmly believe that. And freedom is important in any country in the world.
Lithuania
Q. Some people wonder why the United States, the superpower of the world, pays so much attention to the small Baltic state Lithuania. What could you tell those people?
The President. Well, I can tell those people everybody matters. See, our country believes in the worth of every individual. We believe everybody is precious; everybody counts; and that we are rooted, our whole history and our very being is rooted, on the notion of people being able to realize their dreams. And that's what we believe.
That's why we never recognized the Soviet domination of the Baltics. We called Lithuania independent for all those years. And now we can say, Lithuania is independent, and Lithuania is forever free. And that's our commitment.
Future of NATO
Q. How do you imagine the future of NATO Alliance after new members will join?
The President. Better—better because the—NATO will have this new spirit. Listen, if you lived under slavery and subjugation and you're free, there's a spirit. There's a strength of purpose. There's a remembrance of what it's like. There's no gray areas between good and evil. That's an important spirit in NATO. Lithuania brings a wonderful spirit of strength of purpose, of endurance.
Secondly, as we change the military strategy to reflect the new threat—see, Russia is not a threat militarily. The threats that we now face come from a global terror network. And we'll change our military capabilities to meet the strategies necessary to defeat terrorism. And Lithuania will have an important contribution to make, as will all countries in NATO. So the expansion of NATO will make it easier for us to defend the peace.
Q. Mr. President, thank you very much, indeed. It was a great pleasure to talk to you.
President's Upcoming Visit to Lithuania
The President. We'll see you in Vilnius.
Q. Thank you.
The President. It's going to be exciting for me.
Q. For us, too. We're waiting for that.
The President. I can't wait. Thanks. Make sure the weather is good, will you? [Laughter]
Q. Yes, we'll do our best. Thank you.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-lnk-tv-lithuania
George W. Bush,"November 18, 2002",Interview With European Journalists,"The President. So here's what we're going to do. I'll say a few comments, and we'll kind of do the loop until we run out of time.
First, I'm really looking forward to this trip. I think it's going to be historic. You'll ask me who I'm voting for, for expansion; I'm not going to tell you. You'll find out on Thursday. I say that because that's what we've all agreed to.
But if you're interested in knowing my philosophy toward the Prague summit, then you need only look as far as the speech I gave in Warsaw, Poland, that talked about a Europe whole, free, and at peace. I believe NATO expansion—and in that speech, you'd see that I talked about NATO expansion as good for America, because a Europe whole, free, and at peace is good for America.
I am—believe in the spirit of the countries that we're talking about. I believe in their spirit. These are countries that have lived under totalitarianism, and they understand the value of freedom. And they love freedom, and I love that spirit. I think that's going to be a very important part of invigorating the Alliance.
The Alliance is a crucial alliance. It's a strong alliance. We're going into a new period. And the idea of having members that are willing to shoulder their share of the burden of keeping the peace with the new threats is good, but—and this spirit of understanding what totalitarianism can mean and understanding the responsibilities of being free nations—that come with being a free nation is very important at this summit.
So I'm really looking forward to it. It's— I'm excited to go to countries that have invited me to come. I look forward to the events. And so, with that, I'll answer some questions. Why don't we start here? You are from?
President's Upcoming Visit to Romania
Q. Yes, sir. I am from Romania.
The President. That's good.
Q. Sir, the Romanian people waited for the Americans after the World War II. We've waited for you almost 60 years. You know, the farmers were raising the corn in such a way that the American planes could land. That happened in '45 and the fifties. Now, for my parents, it might be a little bit late, but for my 11-years daughter, it might have a chance. You're coming to Bucharest next Saturday. This time are the Americans really coming to Romania?
The President. Great question. No more Munichs. No more Yaltas. America—I come to your country because I believe that Romania is an important part of a Europe which is whole and free and at peace. The story of Romania is a powerful story, of people taking charge of their own lives, of——
[At this point, a tape recorder stopped.]
The President. We had a click here, in case anybody is interested. This one right here. Poor planning? [Laughter] Nobody claims it? Shouldn't have said poor planning. This is nobody's?
Q. Might be mine.
The President. It's yours?
Q. Yes. If it's out, it's out. That's okay. [Laughter]
The President. You don't want—if you've got to, turn it over. Getting quite articulate there. [Laughter]
A lot of us watched the story of your country ridding yourselves of a totalitarian dictator, and it was a powerful story. But the story didn't end there. The story ended with a desire for freedom and democracy and open markets.
And the answer to your question is, absolutely. That's what the whole Prague summit is about: All for one, and one for all. We remember here in our country when, after the attacks of September the 11th, NATO stood up and said, ""An attack on the United States is an attack on us."" I will say the same thing about Romania and Lithuania and the Czech Republic and anybody else that might be a member of NATO. And that's what I feel.
I appreciate that question. That's—your question is one of the reasons I look so forward to going to Romania——
Q. Thank you, sir.
The President. ——to be able to provide that assurance in what is going to be a, as I understand it, magnificent event where, on the one hand, I will be able to point to statues of heroic liberators, people who believed in freedom, that freedom was ingrained in their soul, and on the other hand, point to a balcony where the dictator had his—he realized reality. It's— as a matter of fact, I was looking at my speech last night.
End of the Cold War
Q. I'm from Lithuania, and Lithuania was recognized 11 years ago by your father, President Bush——
The President. Forty-one, we call him.
Q. ——who took an active role in managing the collapse of the Soviet Union. How do you recall these times?
The President. Yes. Well, first, I want— I remember that, in terms of the Baltic states, that our country always viewed the Baltics as independent. During the Soviet era, we viewed the Baltics as independent. Secondly, I recall the times leading up to the collapse of the Soviet leadership, not only with my dad's actions as President but those of Ronald Reagan as well, where there was clarity of thought, that there was no equivocation when it came to issues such as freedom.
And I keep saying that word because it is an issue that we face collectively today in other parts of the world. Freedom is essentially a human condition. It's not an American gift. It is God's gift to the world. I believe that. I believe that everybody— the Almighty recognizes, through His mercy and grace, that people are—the freedom of each individual. Everybody counts. Everybody is precious.
It was exciting times for Americans to watch the change in the Soviet Union, because it meant that the days of significant animosity could be ending. A lot of us grew up when the two big countries were fierce enemies, and the rest of the world watched to see whether or not there would be war and watched many times in horror as to whether or not there would be war, because the consequences of war between the Soviet Union and America would have been devastating for a lot of people. It looked like that, to us, that the collapse of the Soviet Union would provide an opportunity for peace. That's the most significant— that's the most exciting thing for me, that the relationship would be changed.
I'm honored to be in a position to help further the change of the relationship. I'll answer the Russian journalist's question in a minute—I'm not going to anticipate it— but I am going, after Prague, immediately to Russia for a reason.
And anyway, it was exciting times for us. But the exciting—the true excitement is going to come when the people of the Baltics realize the world has changed dramatically, and it finally has changed dramatically in many ways, that Russia is not an enemy, that the United States is not an enemy of Russia, that the United States is still a friend of the Baltics. But most importantly, the Baltic people have got an opportunity now to realize their full potential. And that was what was 11 years ago we first saw, and it's an honor to be a continuing part of that history.
Yes, sir.
Chechnya/War on Terror
Q. Mr. President, I would like to ask you a question regarding Chechnya.
The President. Sure.
Q. I guess it will be one of the topics you will discuss with Mr. Putin——
The President. Absolutely.
Q. Do you believe that after the latest events—mainly, after hostage in Moscow and after the statements made by Usama bin Laden raising the terrorist acts in Bali and Moscow, do you believe, Mr. President, that you can understand better this red—terrorists pose to Russia? And would you agree—would you agree with President Putin, who says that the Chechen kind of terrorism vis-a-vis Russia is of the same nature as the Al Qaida terrorism to the United States?
The President. Right. You didn't ask the question I thought you were going to ask. I'm going to Russia to make it clear to the Russians and to Vladimir Putin, they have nothing to fear from NATO expansion, that a Baltic—the Baltics in NATO are positive for Russia.
Now, my answer to your question—I thought you were going to ask why I'm going to St. Petersburg. Anyway—[laughter]—and I'm going—I didn't hesitate when Vladimir and I talked about my trip to St. Petersburg, that it was very important for me to go there. And it was important for me say—explain why I think it's a positive development.
Terrorism—first of all, I've got a good friend in the fight against terrorism in Vladimir Putin. He understands the stakes,MDNM and so do I. He understands that as you embrace freedom and embrace change and—that there will be people who resent that and want to impose their will.
Secondly, I thought that at the theater that he was confronted with a very difficult situation. Eight hundred people were— were going to lose their lives. Clearly, these people were killers, just like the killers that came to America. There's a common—a common thread, that anytime anybody is willing to take innocent life for a so-called cause, they must be dealt with. And he made some very tough decisions. And people tried to blame Vladimir; they ought to blame the terrorists. They're the ones who caused the situation, not President Putin.
Thirdly, I believe Chechnya can—I hope that Chechnya can be solved peacefully, that there's ways to discuss the political dialog in such a way that this issue can be solved peacefully. Thirdly, to the extent that there are Al Qaida members infiltrating Russia, they need to be dealt with; they need to be brought to justice. And I— you know, when Usama, praising these— the Muslim attacks in Chechnya, it's clear that there is an Al Qaida interest.
That's why we're working so hard in Georgia with the Georgians to, one, encourage a dialog between Shevardnadze and President Putin, and two, develop a joint strategy to deal with the Al Qaida members which may be in the Pankisi Gorge. And so—but I will continue to talk to Vladimir about the need to protect and recognize the rights of minorities within any country and at the same time deal with terrorism. And I hope he can find that balance. I think he can.
Czech Republic and NATO
Q. Mr. President, how do you assess the performance of the Czech Republic in NATO in preparation for this summit?
The President. Yes, well, first of all, they've been valuable members of NATO. I was able to express that to your President in his recent visit—who, by the way, is an outstanding human being and is highly respected and highly regarded in all of America. NATO has been—I mean, the Czech Republic has been a—was unhesitating in its support of Article 5 in NATO, for which I am grateful. Every conversation I've had with the President, he has been nothing more than anxious for the Czech Republic to perform its role within NATO.
The interesting thing—let me give you kind of a broader statement about what you'll see at the Prague summit—is that everybody has got something to contribute in the military capacities of NATO to deal with the new threats. And the Czech Republic certainly is such a country. There's going to be—I guess, the best word will be specialization—there needs to be a specialization as we develop the military capacity to deal with the true threat.
Russia is not a threat, and therefore, the military strategies of NATO need to be changed to recognize that new reality. Russia is—Russia is a friend, not an enemy. NATO was formed because of the Warsaw Pact. The Warsaw Pact doesn't exist and, therefore, now—but there is a threat to all of us. And that is the threat in the form of international and global terrorism, which we must be able to deal with. The Czech Republic understands that. They're willing to help specialize. And it's up to the Czech Republic to determine that— along with Lord Robertson and his strategy—to determine how best to meet with the threats we face.
Obviously, we've had good relations with the intelligence service of the Czech Republic, which is one of the key ingredients in order to fight terror. If you know somebody is thinking about doing something to us or we know somebody is thinking about doing something to you, we share intelligence. We've got good intelligence-sharing with Russia, by the way, now, because of the joint threat of global terror.
It's a key ingredient in order to make sure we're able to find the new enemy. The enemy doesn't travel in army formations. They're killers. They take theaters. They crash airplanes into buildings. They bomb resorts. And we must know as much about their whereabouts and their plans as possible, in order to find them and bring them to justice. And therefore, there needs to be a different attitude about the threats we face.
In terms of the Prague summit, I am mindful of what happens when the U.S. President shows up at times. I mean, it is—you know, there is going to be a lot of noise and clamor. But I'm actually confident that the Czech Republic will do a fine job. It is a big deal that this city of Prague hosts this, and nations from all over Europe coming and—plus the Canadians and ourselves. I'm sure there's going to be people who are willing to express their voices, that maybe perhaps think NATO— something about NATO is not the way they like it, or whatever it may be. We believe in free speech. Hopefully, they'll have an opportunity to speak freely in a way that's not—that doesn't promote violence.
But the thing that impresses me most about the Czech Republic and its Government is, in spite of the terrible flood, devastating floods, that this Government and these people are anxious to host this meeting and will be able to do so in a great way. And it shows the great character of the people, to rise above the devastation to be able to host this summit. So I'm really looking forward to it. I can't wait to get there and will be there soon.
Romania and NATO
Q. Mr. President, what symbol would you associate to Romania on the new NATO map? I mean, where is the place of Romania in this new NATO map?
The President. How do you mean, what's the place? What do you mean—well, first of all, you're getting me caught—if these countries get in—[laughter]. But the fact that I'm going to your country I guess says something. [Laughter]
Q. We hope so.
The President. Right now I'm off the record. Anyway—[laughter]—first of all, the map is more than just countries on a piece of paper; the map is an attitude. It's an attitude that says that we want to work toward open markets and open societies and transparency and fight corruption. We want to participate in the global war against terror in a way that we're capable of doing so.
Physically, of course, Romania will be the leading edge of Europe extending its reach into Eastern Europe. And it's a significant reach. It is—today, it's interesting, the Vice President and I were being briefed on an issue, and we looked at the map, and the Vice President said, ""I have trouble adjusting to the actual map of NATO."" In other words, the point was that NATO now— NATO's reach is far east. And Romania represents that eastern reach. So physically it's a significant statement of the power of an alliance and the willingness of a people to adopt the habits necessary to have a free society.
It's—I think that's probably the most significant thing about the NATO map. It's an attitude. It's the soul of NATO, like I described earlier. But it's the presence of Romania—really recognizes the change. And it's a significant change. It's an historic—this will be an historic day, our meeting on one day—Thursday, I think is the day—in which the decision will be actually announced.
Lithuania
Q. Although—Mr. President, although, yes—recognize the annexation and occupation of Lithuanian, to most Americans our country was unknown territory for a long time. And can you recall, when did you first and what hear about Lithuania? And what did you think of Lithuania at that time? And what do you think now?
The President. Well, there's a lot of Lithuanian Americans who kept the hope alive of a free and independent Lithuania in America, not so much in my home State of Texas, mainly in the Midwest. And I think a lot of people took pity on the people of Lithuania, given the circumstances. And the Government took its position. But there was a patience by our leadership that eventually freedom would prevail.
Lithuania is kind of a—it's got kind of a—all the Baltics, for that matter—have got an interesting kind of romance because it's a small country. It's totally overwhelmed, divided up. It's kind of handed out as pieces of a—pieces of a settlement that saddened a lot of Americans. But nobody ever gave up hope, I think. Most Americans never gave up hope that the Baltics would some day be able to realize their vast potential.
I'm going to tell you an interesting story. This is from another Baltic country. It's from the Prime Minister of Estonia, came to see me. I'm very hesitant to put words into another leader's mouth. They tend to do it to me, and I don't like it. So I would paraphrase, loosely paraphrase. He was there at the time when—and one of the things I do is welcome a lot of leaders to America; it's an interesting experience. I have done so with the Lithuanian leadership as well.
And I said—this is the day where I told our Congress we were going to encourage a national debate and dialog on Iraq. And I started to give him my rationale as to why I was thinking about Iraq. He said, ""You don't need to talk to me""—this is paraphrasing now—about Iraq. He said, ""Our country has watched democracies go soft in the face of totalitarianism, and we lived in slavery for 50 years.""
Now, that's a paraphrase for the American press. But the point I want to make to you is that he was clear about obligations we have. That's what I think about the Baltics. The spirit—and Romania, for that matter, and the Czech Republic, as embodied in the works and thoughts of Vaclav Havel. That's what I think about your country. You know, I firmly believe that—again, I keep repeating myself, but it's on my mind because this is exactly what we're dealing with at the NATO expansion. And this is the concept of how precious freedom is for people. It is a—and it has a lot to do, frankly, with my thinking about Iraq too.
The fact that people are tortured and subjugated, aren't free to realize their potential, really bothers me. I think we have an obligation to work to free people. There's all kinds of ways to do it, but we have that obligation. It doesn't happen as quickly sometimes as we would like. But that's an obligation of all of us who have got—who live in free countries. You have that obligation. But there's no doubt you'll recognize that obligation because you're freshly free from subjugation. And that's what I was talking about, about the invigoration of the soul of NATO. That's what I think about when I think about the Baltics.
United Nations Resolution on Iraq
Q. Mr. President, you mentioned Iraq.
The President. Yes.
Q. Do you think—do you believe that Russian support of the U.N. resolution on Iraq has promoted any kind of reconciliation between the position of Russia and America on this matter? And what would you like to tell to President Putin in regard to——
The President. Oh, yes. Well, first, I appreciate them working together with us on the resolution. The U.N. Security Council sent a clear signal to Iraq and the world. We expect them to disarm, is what the signal said. And actually, the U.N. Security Council sent a signal about themselves, that they want to be relevant.
You see, if you send out 16 resolutions and all 16 resolutions were ignored, at some point in time, somebody has got to tell the truth and say, ""You're not relevant. Why pass a resolution unless you really mean it?"" And so we got together, and we said, ""Fine, let's pass this significant resolution."" And the Russians were helpful and voted for it. And now the word is out, that the U.N. Security Council will be a relevant body. In other words, we intend to enforce the serious consequences if there's not disarmament, and that we're able to work with our friends. I thought that was a very positive thing.
And I will tell this to Vladimir Putin. It's probably better for me to tell him, but not through your newspapers, but I'll try anyway. The issue is not inspectors. The issue is disarmament. That's the issue. And the question is, will Saddam Hussein disarm? That's what the U.N. Security Council has said, once again, with Russian support, along with other—a lot of other countries. And so he must show us whether or not he'll disarm, for the sake of peace.
And if he doesn't, then we, of course, will consult, like we said we would do— we'd hold a meeting. But the interesting thing about the U.N. Security Council resolution is, all countries are free to act. And that was explained to Vladimir what my sentiments—I'm very strong about. This is not a—this isn't a free pass for Saddam, now that the resolution has been passed. Quite the contrary. We expect him to disarm. And we expect him to do everything he can to disarm. And we expect him to be cooperating in his disarmament for the sake of peace.
And that's what the U.N. Security Council said to me, that people now have finally come to the conclusion that it's time now to deal with the issue. Hopefully, this can get done peacefully. But it's up to Mr. Saddam Hussein, and we'll see. It's time for him to declare if he's got any weapons. And we'll proceed from there.
NATO and Iraq
Q. Mr. President, will you ask the allies in Prague to contribute to military action if such action becomes necessary?
The President. I will—first of all, I believe that the NATO Alliance understands the issue. The countries there would like to see a disarmed Saddam Hussein. They— a peaceful country, they believe in peace, just like I believe in peace. And a Saddam Hussein with weapons of mass destruction is—particularly since he's used them in the past, and he clearly can't stand America and many of our friends—would mean it would be likely for us not to have peace.
Imagine a Saddam Hussein with a nuclear weapon. It's certainly not an ingredient for peace, quite the contrary. And so the NATO countries understand that. And if, in fact, military action is needed, we'll consult with them, and everybody will be able to make a decision that they're comfortable with. But I wouldn't preclude a peaceful settlement. I hope it happens peacefully. But if it doesn't, just—people will know that our intent is to lead a coalition of like-minded, freedom-loving countries, a coalition of the willing to disarm Saddam Hussein. And one way or the other, he's going to be disarmed, and it's in everybody's interest that that be the case.
So we'll talk about that. All right? Thank you for your time. Now, are you going on these trips? You're going to go to the NATO summit? That's going to be exciting. How many journalists will be there?
NATO Summit in Prague
Q. Two thousand seven hundred—that was the last figure I note from Prague before I came here.
The President. Two thousand seven hundred.
Q. Including TV crews.
The President. Wow. Well, I can't wait for my press conference. I'm going to have about a 2-hour press conference there in front of 2,700. [Laughter]
Q. Two days.
The President. Two days. [Laughter] Just kidding, Steve [Steve Holland, Reuters].
Q. Can't wait for that.
The President. You're going?
Q. Yes, sir.
The President. It's going to be exciting. It's going to be a very exciting time. And so you have just come from Prague?
Q. Yes.
The President. So you tell me what the feeling is like there in the city.
Q. Well, the city is almost evacuated, in expecting the summit, because——
The President. The city is evacuated?
Q. No, I'm joking, but the area around the conference center is almost evacuated. And the kids, they have holiday, and the shops are going to be closed, and the center of the city, Wenceslas Square where the demonstrations usually take place, is under police surveillance. So Prague is getting ready, so everyone is expecting how to get to work in—they are making arrangements.
The President. Yes. And how many people are coming, just total? Do they have an estimate? From outside the Czech Republic.
Q. More than 2,000 people—I mean, delegations and——
The President. Oh, it's got to be way more than that.
Q. ——with the staff and everything.
The President. Well, the press is 2,700 alone. I bet there's—our mighty delegation—[laughter].
Q. But only two hotels were affected by the floods. Only two of the number of the hotels that are ready for—to accommodate the delegations and——
The President. They're ready?
Q. ——only two hotels were badly affected by the floods. Otherwise——
The President. How is the recovery from the floods?
Q. It was bad. It was tough, and now it's getting better. There are some neighborhoods in Prague where people cannot return to their homes because of the——
The President. Still?
Q. ——and it's not only Prague. It's the whole country, going into Germany.
The President. So sad.
Q. So it's very bad. No chronicle—no person ever remembers such a disaster.
The President. It's a 500-year flood.
Q. A thousand.
The President. A 1,000-year flood. Wow, that's too bad.
Q. But as we say, Charles did it—from the 14th century. [Laughter]
President's Visits to Europe
The President. Well, I'm glad the country is recovering. We're really looking forward to it and looking forward to our trips, too. They're going to be magnificent.
Q. We expect more people than for the Pope in 1999.
The President. Really? It's going to be exciting. I'm looking forward to it. I better make sure my speech is—I think they'll like it.
All right. We'll see you there. Thanks. Thanks for coming. I'm looking forward to going to St. Petersburg again.
Q. Yes, sure. Thank you very much.
The President. The second time in one year. Maybe a third time.
Q. Did you like it?
The President. Yes, it was spectacular. Remember, we went out on the boat, Vladimir, myself, Sergey Ivanov, floated a— White Nights. Fantastic. It won't be White Nights this time, though. Will be white days, right, snowing?
Q. Yes, snowing. [Laughter]
The President. We'll see you all there. Thank you.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-european-journalists
