Bill Clinton,"March 31, 1999",Interview With Dan Rather of CBS News,"Mr. Rather. Mr. President, thank you for doing this.
The President. Glad to do it, Dan.
Mr. Rather. I appreciate you doing it.
NATO Airstrikes Against Serbian Targets
Mr. Rather. As Commander in Chief, you've sent some of our best to fly every day, every night, through the valley of the shadow of death in a place far away. Why? For what?
The President. For several reasons. First and most important, because there are defenseless people there who are being uprooted from their homes by the hundreds of thousands and who are being killed by the thousands; because it is not an isolated incident but, in fact, a repeat of a pattern we have seen from Mr. Milosevic in Bosnia and Croatia. So there is a compelling humanitarian reason.
Secondly, we haven't been asked to do this alone. All of our NATO Allies are doing it with us. They all feel very strongly about it, and we are moving together. Thirdly, we do not want to see the whole region destabilized by the kind of ethnic aggression that Mr. Milosevic has practiced repeatedly over the last 10 years, but he's been limited. This is, in some ways, the most destabilizing area he could be doing it in. And fourthly, we believe we can make a difference.
And so for all those reasons, I believe we should be doing this.
Mr. Rather. Why now, and why this place? The Russians, in a somewhat similar situation in Chechnya, had maybe 100,000 casualties. We've had Rwanda, Sudan—you didn't go into those places. As a matter of fact, the Serbians argue the Croatians did the same thing with the Serbians in part of Croatia. So why this place? Why right now?
The President. Well, first of all, if you go back to Yugoslavia, we never supported any kind of ethnic cleansing by anybody. And the circumstances under which we went into Bosnia and ended the Bosnian war were designed to guarantee safety and security for all the ethnic groups, not just the Muslims but also the Croats and the Serbs. And the peace agreement that the Kosovar Albanians agreed to would have brought in an international peacekeeping force under NATO that would have guaranteed security to the Serbs as well as to the Albanians.
So the United States and NATO believe that there should be no ethnic cleansing and no people killed or uprooted because of their ethnic background.
Secondly, we're doing it now because now it's obvious that Mr. Milosevic has no interest in an honorable peace that guarantees security and autonomy for the Kosovar Albanians, and instead he is practicing aggression. We might have had to do it last fall, but we were able to head it off. Remember, he created a quarter of a million refugees last year. And NATO threatened to take action, and we worked out an agreement, which was observed for a while, which headed this off.
When we agreed to take action was when he rejected the peace agreement and he had already amassed 40,000 soldiers on the border and in Kosovo, with about 300 tanks. So that's why we're doing it now.
And you asked about other places. In the Rwanda case, let's remember what happened. In Rwanda, without many modern military weapons, somewhere between 500,000 and 800,000—we may never know—people were killed in the space of only 100 days. I think the rest of the world was caught flat-footed and did not have the mechanisms to deal with it. We did do some good and, I think, limited some killing there. But I wish we'd been able to do more there. And I would hope that that sort of thing will not ever happen again in Africa. And that's one of the reasons we worked hard to build up a cooperative relationship with African militaries through the Africa Crisis Response Initiative.
So I believe there are lots of reasons. But if you look at Kosovo, we have a history there in Europe. We know what happens if you have ethnic slaughter there. We know how it can spread. And the main thing is, there is this horrible humanitarian crisis. And because of NATO, because of our allied agreement and because we have the capacity, we believe we can do something about it there. And I think we have to try.
Mr. Rather. You still believe you can do something about it there? The last few days have indicated—well, seem from at least several points of view, Milosevic is winning, and we're losing.
The President. Well, we knew that that would happen in the first few days. He had planned this a long time. Keep in mind, before the first NATO plane got in the air, he already had the 40,000 troops there. Think how we would feel if this were going on and we were doing nothing. There's no question that in—we've run this air campaign for less than a week. We've been hampered by bad weather. We had to be cautious on the early nights to try to at least protect our planes as much as we possibly can against the air defenses, which are quite good.
So it takes a while to get up and going. And against that, he had 40,000 troops and 300 tanks. It shouldn't surprise anybody that he's able to do a lot of what he intended to, even though we've had some success in hitting his military targets in the last couple of days.
But I would urge the American people and, indeed, the people of all the NATO nations to have a little resolve here, to stay with your leaders, to give us a chance to really see this thing through. We cannot view this as something that will be instantaneously successful. This is something that will require some time.
Keep in mind, when we took NATO air action in Bosnia, when we tried to alleviate the siege of Sarajevo, which was a very important precursor to the ultimate peace that was signed there, the air campaign went on for 20 days— with pauses—I think there were 12 days, at least, of bombing. So that's quite a bit more than has been done now—2,300 sorties there.
So the American people and the people of the NATO nations should not be surprised that what has happened on the ground has happened. It was always obvious it was going to happen if there were no opposition to Milosevic. And this thing hasn't had enough time to work. So I would ask for the American people to be patient and to be resolved and be firm and to give our plan a chance to take hold here.
Call for Easter Suspension of Airstrikes
Mr. Rather. Let me follow up some, Mr. President. First of all, the Pope has asked for an Easter suspension of the bombing. Are you prepared to do that?
The President. I don't see how we can do that, with what is going on on the ground there now. Mr. Milosevic is running those people to the Albanian border, to the other borders by the thousands a day; he's killing people. No one would like more than I to properly observe Easter, which for Christians is the most important holiday of all—even more important than Christmas, really, because of what it symbolizes to the living. But we can't observe Easter and honor the resurrection of Christ by allowing him another free day to kill more innocent civilians.
Mr. Rather. And to those people who say, Mr. President, that this is the most important week in the whole Judeo-Christian calendar in many ways because you have Passover, Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, and Easter—that it is ""obscene"" to be carrying on this kind of war during this period—you say what?
The President. That we are acting in defense of the defenseless. We are not carrying on an aggressive war. We are acting at a time when he is going through the country killing people— according to the reports, including moderate politicians—tried to destroy records of what their land holdings are, tried to eradicate any historical record of their claim to their own land, and has given no indication whatever that he's prepared to stop his aggression.
I mean, the cease-fire he offered to Prime Minister Primakov was ludicrous. He didn't offer to withdraw his troops to where they were before this invasion began. He didn't do that. He basically said, ""Well, now, I'll just keep my gang and sit around here, and if everybody wants to stop shooting, that's fine with me.""
Since he's taken all the media out of Kosovo, we would have no way of knowing even whether he was honoring that or not. He could keep right on doing what he's been doing, and there would be no coverage of it.
So this week is a very important week to me personally and to American Christians, to American Jews. Next week will be Easter week for Orthodox observers, Christians not only in— the Serbs, in that part of the world, and among the many, many Orthodox we have in the United States. I hate the idea of having to continue this campaign during this period. But I hate more the idea that we would walk away from this campaign while he continues to clean out house after house after house and village after village after village and kill a lot of innocent people. I think that that would not serve to honor the occasion.
President's Feelings About Kosovo Situation
Mr. Rather. Mr. President, as you always try to do, we're talking in measured tones. As President of the United States, you have to be careful of what you say. But I'm told by those who are close to you that you have a lot of pent-up feelings about what's happening in the Balkans, what we're doing there. Can you share some of that with us?
The President. Well, I guess I do have a lot of pent-up feelings, and I think the President is supposed to keep a lot of those feelings pent up. But let me say, I think throughout human history one of the things that has most bedeviled human beings is their inability to get along with people that are different than they are, and their vulnerability to be led by demagogs who play on their fears of people who are different than they are.
You and I grew up in a part of the country where that was a staple of political life during our childhood. That's why this race issue has always been so important to me in America. And here we are at the end of the cold war; we're on the verge of the 21st century; our stock market went over 10,000 this week; we see the Internet and all this technology with all this promise for all these people, not just the United States but all over the world; and what is the dominant problem of our time? From the Middle East to Northern Ireland to Bosnia to central Africa, people still wanting to kill each other because of their racial and religious, their ethnic, their cultural differences.
This is crazy. And it is embodied in the policies of Mr. Milosevic. He became the leader of the Serbs by playing on their sense of grievance, which may have had some justification— their sense of ethnic grievance—and made them believe that the only way they could fulfill their appropriate human destiny was to create a Serbs-only state, even if it meant they had to go in and go to war with the Bosnian Muslims and they had to go to war with the Croatian Catholics, they had to go to war with Kosovar Albanian Muslims and clean them all out.
And to be doing it in a place where World War I began, which has been the source of so much heartache, where so much instability can occur in other neighboring countries, in the last year of the 20th century, I think is a tragedy.
And I had hoped—he's a clever man, you know, Mr. Milosevic, not to be underestimated. He's tough; he's smart; he's clever. I told all of our people that. The worst thing you can ever do in life is underestimate your adversary. But underneath all that, for reasons that I cannot fathom, there is a heart that has turned too much to stone, that believes that it's really okay that they killed all those people in Bosnia and they made a quarter of a million refugees there—or millions, probably 2 million by the time it was over, dislocated from their home, and a quarter million people died; and it's really okay what they're doing in Kosovo, that somehow non-Serbs, on land that they want, are less than human.
And I guess I've seen too much of that all my life. And I have all these dreams for what the modern world can mean. When I'm long gone from here, I hope that there will be a level of prosperity and opportunity never before known in human history, not just for Americans but for others. And it's all being threatened all over the world by these ancient hatreds.
We're working, trying to bring an end to the Northern Ireland peace process now. We're trying to keep the Middle East peace process going. All of this stuff, it's all rooted in whether people believe that their primary identity is as a member of the human race, that they share with others who are different from them; or if they believe their primary identity is as a result of their superiority over people who may share the same village, the same neighborhood, and the same high-rise apartment but they don't belong to the same ethnic group or racial group or religious group, so if they have to be killed, it's just fine.
I mean, I think that is the basis of Milosevic's power. And that is the threat to our children's world. That's what I believe.
NATO Airstrikes Against Serbian Targets
Mr. Rather. Mr. President, there are reports that as we speak, and through this evening, that there will be air attacks in Belgrade itself, that you've gotten NATO to authorize it. Is that correct? Is that accurate?
The President. It is accurate that we are attacking targets that we believe will achieve our stated objective, which is either to raise the price of aggression to an unacceptably high level, so that we can get back to talking peace and security, or to substantially undermine the capacity of the Serbian Government to wage war.
Mr. Rather. Does that include attacks now in Belgrade? In the vernacular of the military, have you authorized them to go downtown?
The President. I have authorized them to attack targets that I believe are appropriate to achieve our objectives. We have worked very hard to minimize the risks of collateral damage. I think a lot of the Serbian people are—like I said, the Serbs, like other people, are good people. They're hearing one side of the story. They've got a state-run media. They don't have anybody that can talk about Mr. Milosevic the way you get to talk about me from time to time. And that's too bad. And some of those targets are in difficult places. But I do not believe that we can rule out any set of targets that are reasonably related to our stated objective.
Mr. Rather. If I report tonight that we are attacking targets inside Belgrade, will that be inaccurate?
The President. I don't think that you can report tonight that I have confirmed any specific set of targets, because I think that's a mistake until we have actually carried out our mission, and I would not do that. You can report that I have said that I have not ruled out any targets that I believe are reasonably related to our objective of raising the price of his aggression in trying to undermine the capacity to wage war.
Mr. Rather. You know I'm not going to go down a list of targets. When you say that you don't rule out any targets that could help you accomplish the mission, would that—declining to rule out targets—include the Defense Ministry, the Interior Ministry?
The President. I don't think I should discuss the specific targets, because I don't want to compromise our efforts to achieve them. And I don't want to run the risk that unscrupulous people would actually try to stage civilian casualties there that would otherwise not occur. But you can say that I didn't rule out any targets anywhere within Serbia or Kosovo that would be reasonably related to our objectives. You can say that.
Mr. Rather. Mr. President, I want to read to you what some fairly high-ranking military people have said privately. You would understand, they didn't want their names attached to it. ""Dan, we're not employing the full power of our Air Force."" Another one: ""We ran over 200 bombing missions the first day when we moved against Saddam Hussein."" There hasn't been a single day in which you've run as many as 50 bombing missions, with the possible exception of today. Why aren't we going all-out? You've described a situation that you feel passionately about, you think is wrong. Everybody knows if you had a street fight with a bully, you want to hit him the hardest right at first.
The President. You have reported—and you mentioned this to me in the beginning that we have stepped up our attacks and that I have pushed for that. I think it's quite important to emphasize—again, let me say, again—we have done this through and with NATO. It is an organization that operates by consensus. One of the things that has struck me is that in the last 48 hours, because of the actions taken by Mr. Milosevic, the will, the steel, the determination, and the outright anger of our allies has been intensifying exponentially, so that we have now, I think, stronger support than we have ever had for taking the most aggressive action we can.
So I will say to you, I've tried to do everything I can, consistent with maintaining allied unity and with achieving our objectives. I understand the frustration of some of our people in the Pentagon. But I think that the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs would tell you that I have worked very hard with them to give them the maximum possible leeway, showing sensitivity only to targets that would have marginal benefit but cause a lot of collateral damage. I don't want a lot of innocent Serbian civilians to die because they have a man running their country that's doing something atrocious. But some of them are at risk because of that and must be, because we have targets that we need to go after.
Now, we're getting—we've got good allied unity. I think it's worth something to preserve that. And I think that that's what I would ask our military people to understand, too. I know that our top commanders do, because they understand what we're trying to do with NATO. And goodness knows, General Clark, the American general who's the commander of our NATO forces, we have someone who understands Mr. Milosevic very well, who was there during the Bosnian talks, and who is all-out committed to the most aggressive possible response.
So we're doing—we're getting steadily more and more support for being more and more aggressive, and I think that will only grow.
Mr. Rather. Mr. President, I want to pose this next question with all respect, but also directly. Everybody acknowledges you have a brilliant mind; you're an excellent speaker, but sometimes people—people who support you and like you say, well, he parses words too closely— ""what is, is"" argument, all of that. I want to discuss ground troops. In the context of speaking as directly as you possible can, when you say you have no intention to commit ground troops to accomplishing the mission in Kosovo, does that mean we are not going to have ground troops in there—no way, no how, no time?
The President. It means just what it says. I'll come back to the point, but you say people say I parse words too close. That's what they said about President Roosevelt, too. He made a pretty good President. And when people say you parse words too closely, it usually means they want to ask you a question and get you to give an answer which is inconsistent with the objective you're trying to pursue for the American people, and so you don't do what they want you to do. So normally they criticize you not for what you're doing but for what they wish you would do.
Mr. Rather. Fair enough.
The President. I have used those words carefully. I am very careful in the words I use not to mislead one way or the other. And the reason is, I think I have embraced a strategy here that I believe has a reasonable, good chance, a reasonably good chance of succeeding, maybe even a better chance than that, as long as we have more and more steel and will and determination and unity from all of our NATO Allies. And I want to pursue that strategy. And I believe that all these discussions about, well, other strategies and should we do this, that, or the other thing do not help the ultimate success of the strategy we are pursuing. That is why I have used the words I have used; why I have said the words I have said.
Now, on the merits of it, the thing that bothers me about introducing ground troops into a hostile situation—into Kosovo and into the Balkans—is the prospect of never being able to get them out. If you have a peace agreement, even if it's difficult and even if you have to stay a little longer than you thought you would, like in Bosnia, at least there is an exit strategy, and it's a manageable situation. If you go in in a hostile environment in which you do not believe in ethnic cleansing and you do not wish to see any innocent civilians killed, you could be put in a position of, for example, creating a Kosovar enclave that would keep you there forever. And I don't believe that is an appropriate thing to be discussing at this time.
I do think we've got quite a good chance of succeeding with our strategy if we could keep everybody focused on it. And I simply think that it's wrong for us to be obsessing about other things and not working—people are frustrated because we live in an age where everybody wants things to operate like a 30-second ad. This air campaign is not a 30-second ad. It's only been going on a few days, and it's been undermined to some extent by bad weather. But we are blessed with enormously skilled pilots, a good plan, good technology, and good resolve by our allies. And I'd like to see us keep working on this and not to have our attention diverted by other things.
Hillary Clinton's Possible Senate Candidacy
Mr. Rather. Mr. President, there's so many questions and so little time. You know I'm going to be in trouble if I don't ask you some questions on some other subjects, but I'd like to do that and then come back to Kosovo because
I know you agree that this war situation—air war at the moment for us—there's nothing more important than that. But let me shift gears for just a moment.
Could you describe for me what you believe to be the responsibilities of a husband of a United States Senator?
The President. [Laughter] I don't know, but I'm willing to fulfill them. I would do whatever. I would fill in at dinners, make speeches when she had to vote. I'd be the main casework officer of the New York office. I'd do whatever I was asked to do.
Let me say seriously, I have no earthly idea what my wife will do. I can tell you that before some New York officials came to her, it had never crossed her mind. And I still think it's a highly unusual thing. And I can imagine that many voters in New York would wonder whether—even though she and I intended to move to New York after we left the White House, although I would also spend a lot of time at home in Arkansas—they would wonder, well, does this make sense for someone to be a United States Senator. And that would be a burden she would have to carry in the campaign and to explain that—why she was doing it, that she was asked to do it, and demonstrate her commitment to the State and its issues.
I think if she could win an election like that, she would be magnificent. But whatever the duties are—for 22 years now or more, we've done what I wanted to do in terms of my political career. So the deal I made was, she gets the next 22 years. And if I'm still around after that, we can argue about the third phase. And so I would be happy to be the spouse of a Senator.
Mr. Rather. And you expect to do that together as man and wife?
The President. Oh, absolutely. I would—like I said, I don't know what the duties are, but I'm sure I could fulfill them.
First Family
Mr. Rather. Mr. President, you know Americans like to know that the First Family is okay, that they're doing all right. Given the year-plus, what you and our First Family have been through, tell us what you can about how the three of you are doing.
The President. Well, I think, given what we've been through, we're doing reasonably well. We're not a large family. We do love each other very much, and we work hard to support one another. And I think that this trip to north Africa has been a good thing not only for our country—because I think Hillary has done a great job on it—I think it must have been good for Hillary and Chelsea, too, to have that time together, to do some exciting things, to be in a different environment. And I think they've really enjoyed it. I think we're doing quite well considering what we've been through. And God willing, we'll keep after it.
Lessons of the Past Year
Mr. Rather. How about yourself, Mr. President? We're here in a room with pictures of Lincoln, Washington, Continental Congress. And you're thinking about sending our sons and daughters into war; I know that. But I also know you tend to stay up late at night; you always have done that. When you look back over this year-plus, what's the moral of it? Does it have a moral?
The President. Oh, yes, I think there is more than one lesson here. I think, first of all, the moral is—there's a personal moral, which is that every person must bear the consequences of his or her conduct, and when you make a mistake, you pay for it, no matter who you are. And it's true whether or not it's made public, or whether or not what's made public is exactly accurate reflection of what in fact happened— that's not the important thing. The important thing is that there are consequences in people's personal lives, no matter who they are.
The second lesson is that the Constitution works. The Founding Fathers were smart people. They understood that partisan passions which very often get carried away in the temptation to seize on events of the moment would be too great, and that's why they wrote the Constitution the way they did. And they were awfully smart.
The third thing that I think we learned this year is that the American people almost always get it right if you give them enough time to think through things and really work on it.
And the fourth thing I think we learned is that people expect their elected officials to work for them and not be forced to be focused on themselves or their adversaries in Washington, and that they will reward those who they believe get up every day and show up for work and work for them and their future and their children, and they will take account of those they believe do not.
Those are, I think, the lessons of the last year.
Option of Resignation
Mr. Rather. You said the American people, if given enough time—did you ever consider resigning?
The President. Never.
Mr. Rather. Never for a second?
The President. Never. Not a second. Never. Never.
Mr. Rather. Never entered your mind?
The President. Never entered my mind.
Mr. Rather. Did the First Lady ever come to you and say, ""Listen, I think we ought to at least consider it?""
The President. No. She felt at least as strongly as I did that it shouldn't be done.
Mr. Rather. That tells me she might have felt even stronger.
The President. At least as strongly as I did. But it never crossed my mind. I wouldn't do that to the Constitution. I wouldn't do that to the Presidency. I wouldn't do that to the history in this country. I would never have legitimized what I believe is horribly wrong with what has occurred here over the last 4 or 5 years. So it never crossed my mind. And I always had faith. I just—I prayed about it. I tried to work on maintaining my inner spiritual strength, and I tried to come to grips with the work I had to do personally with my family and myself and the work I owed the American people. And I just decided that of all the options available, that wasn't one. And it never entered my mind.
Public's Response to President's Conduct
Mr. Rather. Mr. President, I get a lot of letters—not as many as you do, but I get a lot of letters from parents who say, some of them say, ""Listen, I like President Clinton, I like what he's doing for the country."" Some of them even say they'd ""vote for him again, but I don't know what to tell the children on the worst aspects of what happened last year."" Let's try to give these parents some help. What can they tell the children? What do they tell——
The President. Well, it's interesting, you know. I get a lot of letters from parents and from children—interesting letters from children—and sometimes pretty young children—11-, 12-, 13year-old kids writing me, some of them, on this very point, and offended that they're being used in that way, because what they say is, ""What I learned from this is what my parents always told me: that nobody is so big or so important that they're not subject to the same rules of human conduct; and that when they do things they shouldn't, they have to bear the consequences. But if they bear the consequences, say they're sorry and go on, they should be able to go on with their lives, because they also know that every person makes mistakes. No one is so big or so important that they are perfect.""
And so that's what I would say to our children. That's what I think the lessons of all those Bible stories are, of the great figures of the Bible who did things they shouldn't have done. The reason those stories are in the Bible is to say, everyone sins, but everyone is held accountable, and everyone has a chance to go on—and that all three of those points need to be made. And if you say that to our children, I think that's what needs to be said.
Kids are pretty smart, and they—this is a good lesson, not a bad lesson for them. I'm sorry that I had to be the example, and it's painful. But the lessons, the right lessons properly learned, will be good for them and good for our country.
Impeachment
Mr. Rather. Mr. President, I hear this clock ticking, and it isn't the ""60 Minutes"" clock. And I do want to get back to the war situation, but in this category—last question, if you'll indulge me—you agree that whatever you do, however this situation in Kosovo turns out, whatever else you do, in the first paragraph of your obituary is going to be a reference to what you consider among the worst things that has ever happened to you: the only President in the 20th century to be impeached; one of only two Presidents to be impeached. Give me some sense of how you feel about that, within yourself.
The President. Well, first of all, I'm not at all sure that's right, that it will be the first paragraph of the obituary. And secondly, if it is, if the history writers are honest, they'll tell it for just exactly what it was. And I am honored that something that was indefensible was pursued and that I had the opportunity to defend the Constitution. That doesn't have anything to do with the fact that I did something I shouldn't have done, of which I am ashamed of, and which I apologize for. But it had nothing to do with the impeachment process. And I think that's what the American people, two-thirds of them, knew all along. And I determined that I would defend the Constitution and the work of my administration. And those that did not agree with what I had done and were furious that it had worked and that the country was doing well, and attempted to use what should have been a constitutional and legal process for political ends, did not prevail. And that's the way I saw it.
I have no lingering animosity. I don't wake up every day mad at those people——
Mr. Rather. You've got to be bitter about some of it.
The President. I'm not. I have—I'm not. I learned—look, I'm not. And I'm not saying that for any reason other than that I have—part of the learning process that I went through in the last 6 years, but certainly in the last—and in the last several years when I was dealing with this, when I saw—all these other charges, they were always false; they never amounted to anything. And half the people that were propagating them knew they were false. I realized that, particularly in the last year, if I wanted people to give me forgiveness, I had to extend forgiveness. If I wanted to be free to be the best President and the best husband and father and the best person I could be, I had to free myself of bitterness.
And I have worked very hard at it. And I have had very powerful examples. I look at a man like Nelson Mandela, who suffered enormously. Yes, he was part of a political movement that was threatening to the people who were in, but he didn't deserve to go to jail for 27 years. And in the 27 years he was there, he purged himself of his hatred and also of whatever might have been wrong with himself, and his hatred for other people. Now, if a person like that can rid himself of bitterness, what I went through was peanuts compared to that. It was nothing.
And I think it's an—and any moment I spend full of anger and bitterness is a moment I am robbing from my wife or from my daughter or from my country or from my friends. So it's almost a selfish decision. But I do not regard this impeachment vote as some great badge of shame; I do not. Because it was—I do not believe it was warranted, and I don't think it was right.
And I believe, frankly, if you look back at President Andrew Johnson, who unfortunately, because of the circumstances under which he came to office, didn't have the opportunity to achieve very much while he was President, I think most people believe that he was unjustly impeached and that the fact that he stood up to it and refused to give in and came within much closer than I did—he came within only a vote of actually being removed—reflects well on him and the history of the country, not poorly.
And so I just don't have bad feelings about that. But neither do I have feelings of anger and bitterness against those who did what they did, whether they believed it or whether it was political, or whatever. I just think that it's past us, and we need to put it behind us, and we need to go on. We owe that to the American people, to let it go. And all of us owe it to our families and our personal lives. All the great players here, they need to let it go and go on with the business of the country.
Serbia's Strategy in Kosovo
Mr. Rather. Mr. President, you have been very generous with your time, and I appreciate it. I want to get back to the war. Let me sketch out for you a scenario which a number of diplomats and some military people have said this could happen: Milosevic will have defeated the Kosovo Liberation Army, self-described as such, and he will have rid Kosovo—driven out most of, if not all of, the Albanians. He's very near having accomplished that. So over the next few days, having accomplished that on the ground, while our air campaign tries to build this momentum you've talked about, he then says, ""Okay, I'm ready to talk."" Doesn't that leave us defeated? Or does it?
The President. It does if we accept that result—if we accept that result. Because I think we've got to say, ""But the Kosovars have all got to be able to come home, and they have to be secure, and they have to be given the autonomy of self-government""——
Mr. Rather. Excuse me—you're talking about in some enclave, some protected enclave?
The President. No, I'm talking about they're entitled to come back to Kosovo, to go back to their villages where they were, and to enjoy self-government and security. But keep in mind, Dan, let me say again, there is no scenario under which this last week could not have occurred, if he was willing to do it.
Mr. Rather. You don't think the air campaign gave him the opening to do this?
The President. No, no, that I'm sure of. I just met with a bunch of Kosovar Albanians here—excuse me, a bunch of Albanian-Americans here—I'm sorry—in the White House. One man told me he had 24 cousins in Pristina. Every one of them said to me, ""Don't let people tell you that this NATO air campaign caused Milosevic to do that. Everybody knows that's a bunch of bull.""
Mr. Rather. You're absolutely convinced——
The President. Absolutely.
Mr. Rather. ——that it didn't touch it off.
The President. No. He had 40,000 soldiers on the border and inside Kosovo.
Mr. Rather. And hundreds of tanks?
The President. Almost 300—before any of this happened. Last October he had already created a quarter of a million refugees before the NATO threat got him to stop. This is a part of his strategy. He started his ethnic cleansing politics with a big speech against the Kosovars in Kosovo 12 years ago, and then he got diverted into his wars in Bosnia and Croatia. So I believe this is a plan he had all along.
Now, suppose—you could take any scenario. If we had said, ""Well, if you do this, ground troops are on the way""—suppose that had been said—it would take much longer to mobilize that than it did the air campaign. He had the armor; he had the men; he had the air cover; he had the weapons; he had all this stuff he could do.
And the UCK, the Kosovar Liberation Army, all those people, all they could ever do was to fight what was, in effect, a guerrilla war, which they could still do. They may be run out of the country; they could come back. They may be run up into the hills; they can come down—with support they got from their kinfolks and relatives outside of the region.
So I think it's very important to note that there—that under any set of circumstances, his military could have done what they have done these last 5 days.
Mr. Rather. And you think they would have done——
The President. Absolutely. I am totally convinced of that. So is everyone else that I know who's been dealing with this for any length of time. Would they have waited another week to do it? Maybe. But I'm convinced that that's exactly what they wanted to do. They didn't show up in those numbers with those tanks for their health. That's what they were going to do.
So I think the real issue is—I think that that was a decision certainly made when he realized—he did not want the framework of the peace agreement, which was, let them have self-government within the autonomous framework that governed Yugoslavia for all those years, and let's have an international force in there to keep them safe. Even though the international force—I want to say again, because there may be a lot of Serbian-Americans listening to this interview—the international force, we made it clear that we would not go in there, and neither would our NATO Allies, unless they were also free to protect the Serbian minority in Kosovo, because so much blood has been shed and so many people that have been dislocated that they, too, are vulnerable to people taking it out on them because they're Serbs. So we said we would not go in there unless we also protected the Serbs.
But, yes, I'm completely convinced. Prime Minister Blair believes that. Chancellor Schroeder believes that.
Mr. Rather. And you believe it.
The President. With every fiber of my being. I am convinced. Look at what this guy did in— let's go back to Bosnia: 2 million refugees, a quarter of a million people dead. There is no question that this is his strategy. And he was very angry that finally what had been a passive resistance from the Kosovars, a peaceful resistance for 10 years, began to manifest itself then in violent exchanges in return for—in reaction to what the Serbians had done.
I think he wanted to clean them out. I think he wanted to ethically cleanse the country as much as he could. I think he wanted to drastically alter the population balance. I think he wanted to eradicate all the records of the Albanians and the property they own. I think he wanted to erase the history and start all over again. That's what I think.
Mr. Rather. Is genocide too strong a word, Mr. President?
The President. Well, as you know, I try to be hesitant in using it. There is no question that a few thousand people have been murdered because they were Kosovar Albanians. There's no question about that.
Mr. Rather. But you hesitate to use the word genocide.
The President. But I think because—it's only a question of whether enough people have been killed yet. There's no question that what he was doing constitutes ethnic cleansing and that he was killing and uprooting people because of their ethnic heritage. There is no question about that. And I think that not only he, but others who are in decisionmaking positions, have to be held accountable for what they've done. And of course, this whole war crimes tribunal that's been set up to review what happened in the Balkans will have to review those facts. But the main thing I want to do is, whatever the label belongs on it, is to stop it if we can.
Legal Status of Kosovo
Mr. Rather. Mr. President, I'm getting the wrap-up sign, and I must ask you—help me as a reporter. You seemed to hint within the last 24 hours, at least hint—and the newspaper stories say, ""President hints at a change in position""—an independent Kosovo, as opposed to a semi-autonomous Kosovo. Has there been a change in your thinking? Are you changing the policy? Is there likely to be one? Help me explain that to folks.
The President. What I said, I'll say it again, because I think it's pretty clear. The United States has supported the historic legal status of Kosovo as an autonomous province of Serbia. We think it would be difficult for the Kosovars, politically, economically, to sustain independence because of their small size and because of the stage of their economic development.
But what I said, and I'll say again, is that Mr. Milosevic is in danger of forfeiting the claim of the Serbs to have government over those people in their own land. That's the problem. It's his conduct. It's not that we've had a change of heart about what would be best, if you will, or that we would honor the rule of international law, which still has lodged Kosovo as an independent province of Serbia. It's whether—and we tried to tell Mr. Milosevic all along that this peace process was the best chance he had to keep the Kosovars as a part of Serbia, because there would be a 3-year period during which they could demonstrate, the Serbs, good faith in letting them govern themselves. We could protect the Serbian minority as well as the Albanian majority in Kosovo. And they could see that economically it would be better, as well as politically. He's just about blown all that off. That's the——
Mr. Rather. You think he now has that at deep risk?
The President. It's very much at risk, not because of a change of heart by us but because of a change of behavior by him.
Mr. Rather. Mr. President, thank you.
The President. Thank you.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-dan-rather-cbs-news-0
Bill Clinton,"May 13, 1999","Remarks to the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States at Fort McNair, Maryland","Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you, Commander Pouliot. I am grateful to you and to Veterans of Foreign Wars for your support of America's efforts in Kosovo.
General Chilcoat, Secretary Albright, Secretary Cohen, Secretary West, National Security Adviser Berger, Deputy Secretary Gober, General Shelton and the Joint Chiefs, and to the members of the military and members of the VFW who are here. I'd also like to thank Congressman Engel and Congressman Quinn for coming to be with us today.
I am especially honored to be here with our veterans who have struggled for freedom in World War II and in the half century since. Your service inspires us today, as we work with our Allies to reverse the systematic campaign of terror and to bring peace and freedom to Kosovo. To honor your sacrifices and fulfill the vision of a peaceful Europe for which so many of the VFW members risked your lives, NATO's mission, as the Commander said, must succeed.
My meetings last week in Europe with Kosovar refugees, with Allied leaders, with Americans in uniform, strengthened my conviction that we will succeed. With just 7 months left in the 20th century, Kosovo is a crucial test: Can we strengthen a global community grounded in cooperation and tolerance, rooted in common humanity? Or will repression and brutality, rooted in ethnic, racial, and religious hatreds, dominate the agenda for the new century and the new millennium?
The World War II veterans here fought in Europe and in the Pacific to prevent the world from being dominated by tyrants who used racial and religious hatred to strengthen their grip and to justify mass killing.
President Roosevelt said in his final Inaugural Address: ""We have learned that we cannot live alone. We cannot live alone at peace. We have learned that our own well-being is dependent on the well-being of other nations far away. We have learned to be citizens of the world, members of the human community.""
The sacrifices of American and Allied troops helped to end a nightmare, rescue freedom, and lay the groundwork for the modern world that has benefited all of us. In the long cold war years, our troops stood for freedom and against communism until the Berlin Wall fell and the Iron Curtain collapsed.
Now, the nations of central Europe are free democracies. We've welcomed new members to NATO and formed security partnerships with many other countries all across Europe's east, including Russia and Ukraine. Both the European Union and NATO have pledged to continue to embrace new members.
Some have questioned the need for continuing our security partnership with Europe at the end of the cold war. But in this age of growing international interdependence, America needs a strong and peaceful Europe more than ever as our partner for freedom and for economic progress and our partner against terrorism, the spread of weapons of mass destruction, and instability.
The promise of a Europe undivided, democratic, and at peace, is at long last within reach. But we all know it is threatened by the ethnic and religious turmoil in southeastern Europe, where most leaders are freely elected and committed to cooperation, both within and among their neighbors.
Unfortunately, for more than 10 years now, President Milosevic has pursued a different course for Serbia, and for much of the rest of the former Yugoslavia. Since the late 1980's, he has acquired, retained, and sought to expand his power by inciting religious and ethnic hatred in the cause of Greater Serbia, by demonizing and dehumanizing people, especially the Bosnian and Kosovar Muslims, whose history, culture, and very presence in the former Republic of Yugoslavia impedes that vision of a Greater Serbia. He unleashed wars in Bosnia and Croatia, creating 2 million refugees and leaving a quarter of a million people dead. A decade ago, he stripped Kosovo of its constitutional self-government and began harassing and oppressing its people. He has also rejected brave calls among his own Serb people for greater liberty. Today, he uses repression and censorship at home to stifle dissent and to conceal what he is doing in Kosovo.
Though his ethnic cleansing is not the same as the ethnic extermination of the Holocaust, the two are related, both vicious, premeditated, systematic oppression fueled by religious and ethnic hatred. This campaign to drive the Kosovars from their land and to, indeed, erase their very identity is an affront to humanity and an attack not only on a people but on the dignity of all people. Even now, Mr. Milosevic is being investigated by the International War Crimes Tribunal for alleged war crimes, including mass killing and ethnic cleansing.
Until recently, 1.7 million ethnic Albanians, about the population of our State of Nebraska, lived in Kosovo among a total population of 2 million, the other being Serbs.
The Kosovar Albanians are farmers and factory workers, lawyers and doctors, mothers, fathers, school children. They have worked to build better lives under increasingly difficult circumstances. Today, most of them are in camps in Albania, Macedonia, and elsewhere, nearly 900,000 refugees, some searching desperately for lost family members. Or they are trapped within Kosovo itself, perhaps 600,000 more of them, lacking shelter, short of food, afraid to go home. Or they are buried in mass graves dug by their executioners.
I know we see these pictures of the refugees on television every night, and most people would like another story. But we must not get refugee fatigue. We must not forget the real victims of this tragedy. We must give them aid and hope. And we in the United States must make sure—must make sure—their stories are told.
A Kosovar farmer told how Serb tanks drove into his village. Police lined up all the men, about 100 of them, by a stream and opened fire. The farmer was hit by a bullet in the shoulder. The weight of falling bodies all round him pulled him into the stream. The only way he could stay alive was to pretend to be dead. From a camp in Albania, he said, ""My daughter tells me, ‘Father, sleep. Why don't you sleep?' But I can't. All those dead bodies on top of mine.""
Another refugee told of trying to return to his village in Kosovo's capital, Pristina. ""On my way,"" he said, ""I met one of my relatives. He told me not to go back because there were snipers on the balconies. Minutes after I left, the man was killed. I found him. Back in Pristina no one could go out because of the Serb policemen in the streets. It was terrible to see our children; they were so hungry. Finally, I tried to go shopping. Four armed men jumped out and said, ‘We're going to kill you if you don't get out of here.' My daughters were crying day and night. We were hearing stories about rape. They begged me, ‘Please get us out of there.' So we joined thousands of people going through the streets at night toward the train station. In the train wagons, police were tearing up passports, taking money, taking jewelry.""
Another refugee reported, ""The Serbs surrounded us. They killed four children because their families did not have money to give to the police. They killed them with knives, not guns.""
Another recalled, ""The police came early in the morning. They executed almost 100 people. They killed them all, women and children. They set a fire and threw the bodies in.""
A pregnant woman watched Serb forces shoot her brother in the stomach. She said, ""My father asked for someone to help this boy, but the answer he got was a beating. The Serbs told my brother to put his hands up, and then they shot him 10 times. I saw this. I saw my brother die.""
Serb forces, their faces often concealed by masks, as they were before in Bosnia, have rounded up Kosovar women and repeatedly raped them. They have said to children, ""Go into the woods and die of hunger.""
Last week in Germany I met with a couple of dozen of these refugees, and I asked them all, in turn, to speak about their experience. A young man—I'd say 15 or 16 years old— stood up and struggled to talk. Finally, he just sat down and said, ""Kosovo, I cannot talk about Kosovo.""
Nine of every ten Kosovar Albanians now has been driven from their homes, thousands murdered, at least 100,000 missing, many young men led away in front of their families; over 500 cities, towns, and villages torched. All this has been carried out, you must understand, according to a plan carefully designed months earlier in Belgrade. Serb officials pre-positioned forces, tanks, and fuel and mapped out the sequence of attack: What were the soldiers going to do; what were the paramilitary people going to do; what were the police going to do.
Town after town has seen the same brutal procedures: Serb forces taking valuables and identity papers, seizing or executing civilians, destroying property records, bulldozing and burning homes, mocking the fleeing.
We and our Allies, with Russia, have worked hard for a just peace. Just last fall, Mr. Milosevic agreed under pressure to halt the previous assault on Kosovo, and hundreds of thousands of Kosovars were able to return home. But soon, he broke his commitment and renewed violence.
In February and March, again we pressed for peace, and the Kosovar Albanian leaders accepted a comprehensive plan, including the disarming of their insurgent forces, though it did not give them all they wanted. But instead of joining the peace, Mr. Milosevic, having already massed some 40,000 troops in and around Kosovo, unleashed his forces to intensify their atrocities and complete his brutal scheme.
Now, from the outset of this conflict, we and our Allies have been very clear about what Belgrade must do to end it. The central imperative is this: The Kosovars must be able to return home and live in safety. For this to happen, the Serb forces must leave; partial withdrawals can only mean continued civil war with the Kosovar insurgents. There must also be an international security force with NATO at its core. Without that force, after all they've been through, the Kosovars simply won't go home. Their requirements are neither arbitrary nor overreaching. These things we have said are simply what is necessary to make peace work.
There are those who say Europe and its North American allies have no business intervening in the ethnic conflicts of the Balkans. They are the inevitable result, these conflicts, according to some, of centuries-old animosities which were unleashed by the end of the cold war restraints in Yugoslavia and elsewhere. I, myself, have been guilty of saying that on an occasion or two, and I regret it now more than I can say. For I have spent a great deal of time in these last 6 years reading the real history of the Balkans. And the truth is that a lot of what passes for common wisdom in this area is a gross oversimplification and misreading of history.
The truth is that for centuries these people have lived together in the Balkans and southeastern Europe with greater or lesser degree of tension but often without anything approaching the intolerable conditions and conflicts that exist today. And we do no favors to ourselves or to the rest of the world when we justify looking away from this kind of slaughter by oversimplifying and conveniently, in our own way, demonizing the whole Balkans by saying that these people are simply incapable of civilized behavior with one another.
Second, there is—people say, ""Okay, maybe it's not inevitable, but look, there are a lot of ethnic problems in the world. Russia has dealt with Chechnya, and you've got Abkhazia and Ossetia on the borders of Russia. And you've got all these ethnic problems everywhere, and religious problems. That's what the Middle East is about. You've got Northern Ireland. You've got the horrible, horrible genocide in Rwanda. You've got the war now between Eritrea and Ethiopia."" They say, ""Oh, we've got all these problems, and, therefore, why do you care about this?""
I say to them, there is a huge difference between people who can't resolve their problems peacefully and fight about it and people who resort to systematic ethnic cleansing and slaughter of people because of their religious or ethnic background. There is a difference. There is a difference.
And that is the difference that NATO—that our Allies have tried to recognize and act on. I believe that is what we saw in Bosnia and Kosovo. I think the only thing we have seen that really rivals that, rooted in ethnic or religious destruction, in this decade is what happened in Rwanda. And I regret very much that the world community was not organized and able to act quickly there as well.
Bringing the Kosovars home is a moral issue, but it is a very practical, strategic issue. In a world where the future will be threatened by the growth of terrorist groups, the easy spread of weapons of mass destruction, the use of technology including the Internet, for people to learn how to make bombs and wreck countries, this is also a significant security issue. Particularly because of Kosovo's location, it is just as much a security issue for us as ending the war in Bosnia was.
Though we are working hard with the international community to sustain them, a million or more permanent Kosovar refugees could destabilize Albania, Macedonia, the wider region, become a fertile ground for radicalism and vengeance that would consume southeastern Europe. And if Europe were overwhelmed with that, you know we would have to then come in and help them. Far better for us all to work together, to be firm, to be resolute, to be determined to resolve this now.
If the European community and its American and Canadian allies were to turn away from and, therefore, reward ethnic cleansing in the Balkans, all we would do is to create for ourselves an environment where this sort of practice was sanctioned by other people who found it convenient to build their own political power, and therefore, we would be creating a world of trouble for Europe and for the United States in the years ahead.
I'd just like to make one more point about this, in terms of the history of the Balkans. As long as people have existed, there have been problems among people who were different from one another, and there probably always will be. But you do not have systematic slaughter and an effort to eradicate the religion, the culture, the heritage, the very record of presence of the people in any area unless some politician thinks it is in his interest to foment that sort of hatred. That's how these things happen. People with organized political and military power decide it is in their interest, that they get something out of convincing the people they control or they influence to go kill other people and uproot them and dehumanize them.
I don't believe that the Serb people in their souls are any better—I mean, any worse than we are. Do you? Do you believe when a little baby is born into a certain ethnic or racial group, that somehow they have some poison in there that has to, at some point when they grow up, turn into some vast flame of destruction? Congressman Engel has got more Albanians than any Congressman in the country in his district. Congressman Quinn's been involved in the peace process in Ireland. You think there's something about the Catholic and Protestant Irish kids that sort of genetically predisposes them to—you know better than that, because we're about to make peace there, I hope—getting closer.
Political leaders do this kind of thing. Think the Germans would have perpetrated the Holocaust on their own without Hitler? Was there something in the history of the German race that made them do this? No.
We've got to get straight about this. This is something political leaders do. And if people make decisions to do these kinds of things, other people can make decisions to stop them. And if the resources are properly arrayed, it can be done. And that is exactly what we intend to do.
Now, last week, despite our differences over the NATO action in Kosovo, Russia joined us, through the G-8 foreign ministers, in affirming our basic condition for ending the conflict, in affirming that the mass expulsion of the Kosovars cannot stand. We and Russia agreed that the international force ideally should be endorsed by the United Nations, as it was in Bosnia. And we do want Russian forces, along with those of other nations, to participate, because a Russian presence will help to reassure the Serbs who live in Kosovo, and they will need some protection, too, after all that has occurred.
NATO and Russian forces have served well side-by-side in Bosnia, with forces from many other countries. And with all the difficulties, the tensions, the dark memories that still exist in Bosnia, the Serbs, the Muslims, and the Croats are still at peace and still working together. Nobody claims that we can make everyone love each other overnight. That is not required. But what is required are basic norms of civilized conduct.
Until Serbia accepts these conditions, we will continue to grind down its war machine. Today our Allied air campaign is striking at strategic targets in Serbia and directly at Serb forces in Kosovo, making it harder for them to obtain supplies, protect themselves, and attack the ethnic Albanians who are still there. NATO actions will not stop until the conditions I have described for peace are met.
Last week I had a chance to meet with our troops in Europe, those who are flying the missions, and those who are organizing and leading our humanitarian assistance effort. I can tell you that you and all Americans can be very, very proud of them. They are standing up for what is right. They are performing with great skill and courage and sense of purpose. And in their attempts to avoid civilian casualties, they are sometimes risking their own lives. The wing commander at Spangdahlem Air Force Base in Germany told me, and I quote, ""Sir, our team wants to stay with this mission until it's finished.""
I am very grateful to these men and women. They are worthy successors to those of you in this audience who are veterans today.
Of course, we regret any casualties that are accidental, including those at the Chinese Embassy. But let me be clear again: These are accidents. They are inadvertent tragedies of conflict. We have worked very hard to avoid them. I'm telling you, I talked to pilots who told me that they had been fired at with mobile weapons from people in the middle of highly populated villages, and they turned away rather than answer fire because they did not want to risk killing innocent civilians. That is not our policy.
But those of you who wear the uniform of our country and the many other countries represented here in this room today and those of you who are veterans know that it is simply not possible to avoid casualties of noncombatants in this sort of encounter. We are working hard. And I think it is truly remarkable—I would ask the world to note that we have now flown over 19,000 sorties, thousands and thousands of bombs have been dropped, and there have been very few incidents of this kind. I know that you know how many there have been because Mr. Milosevic makes sure that the media has access to them.
I grieve for the loss of the innocent Chinese and for their families. I grieve for the loss of the innocent Serbian civilians and their families. I grieve for the loss of the innocent Kosovars who were put into a military vehicle—that our people thought was a military vehicle, and they've often been used as shields.
But I ask you to remember the stories I told you earlier. There are thousands of people that have been killed systematically by the Serb forces. There are 100,000 people who are still missing. We must remember who the real victims are here and why this started.
It is no accident that Mr. Milosevic has not allowed the international media to see the slaughter and destruction in Kosovo. There is no picture reflecting the story that one refugee told of 15 men being tied together and set on fire while they were alive. No, there are no pictures of that. But we have enough of those stories to know that there is a systematic effort that has animated our actions, and we must not forget it.
Now, Serbia faces a choice. Mr. Milosevic and his allies have dragged their people down a path of racial and religious hatred. This has resulted, again and again, in bloodshed, in loss of life, in loss of territory, and denial of the Serbs' own freedom and, now, in an unwinnable conflict against the united international community. But there is another path available, one where people of different backgrounds and religions work together, within and across national borders, where people stop redrawing borders and start drawing blueprints for a prosperous, multiethnic future.
This is the path the other nations of southeastern Europe have adopted. Day after day, they work to improve lives, to build a future in which the forces that pull people together are stronger than those that tear them apart. Albania and Bulgaria, as well as our NATO Ally Greece, have overcome historical differences to recognize the independence of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Romania, Bulgaria, Macedonia, and others have deepened freedoms, promoted tolerance, pursued difficult economic reforms. Slovenia has advanced democracy at home and prosperity, stood for regional integration, increased security cooperation with a center to defuse landmines left from the conflict in Bosnia.
These nations are reaffirming that discord is not inevitable, that there is not some Balkan disease that has been there for centuries, always waiting to break out. They are drawing on a rich past where peoples of the region did, in fact, live together in peace.
Now, we and our Allies have been helping to build that future, but we have to accelerate our efforts. We will work with the European Union, the World Bank, the IMF, and others to ease the immediate economic strains, to relieve debt burden, to speed reconstruction, to advance economic reforms and regional trade. We will promote political freedom and tolerance of minorities.
At our NATO Summit last month we agreed to deepen our security engagement in the region, to adopt an ambitious program to help aspiring nations improve their candidacies to join the NATO Alliance. They have risked and sacrificed to support the military and humanitarian efforts. They deserve our support.
Last Saturday was the anniversary of one of the greatest days in American history and in the history of freedom, V-E Day. Though America celebrated that day in 1945, we did not pack up and go home. We stayed to provide economic aid, to help to bolster democracy, to keep the peace and because our strength and resolve was important as Europe rebuilt, learned to live together, faced new challenges together.
The resources we devoted to the Marshall plan, to NATO, to other efforts, I think we would all agree have been an enormous bargain for our long-term prosperity and security here in the United States, just as the resources we are devoting here at this institution to reaching out to people from other nations, to their officers, to their military, in a spirit of cooperation are an enormous bargain for the future security of the people of the United States.
Now, that's what I want to say in my last point here. War is expensive; peace is cheaper. Prosperity is downright profitable. We have to invest in the rebuilding of this region. Southeastern Europe, after the cold war, was free but poor. As long as they are poor, they will offer a less compelling counterweight to the kind of ethnic exclusivity and oppression that Mr. Milosevic preaches.
If you believe the Marshall plan worked and you believe war is to be avoided whenever possible and you understand how expensive it is and how profitable prosperity is, how much we have gotten out of what we have done, then we have to work with our European Allies to rebuild southeastern Europe and to give them an economic future that will pull them together.
The European Union is prepared to take the lead role in southeastern Europe's development. Russia, Ukraine, other nations of Europe's east are building democracy; they want to be a part of this.
We are trying to do this in other places in the world. What a great ally Japan has been for peace and prosperity and will be again as they work to overcome their economic difficulty. Despite our present problems, I still believe we must remain committed to building a long-term strategic partnership with China.
We must work together with people where we can, as we prepare, always, to protect and defend our security if we must. But a better world and a better Europe are clearly in America's interests.
Serbia and the rest of the Balkans should be part of it. So I want to say this one more time: Our quarrel is not with the Serbian people. The United States has been deeply enriched by Serbian-Americans. Millions of Americans are now cheering for some Serbian-Americans as we watch the basketball playoffs every night on television. People of Serbian heritage are an important part of our society. We can never forget that the Serbs fought bravely with the Allies against Fascist aggression in World War II, that they suffered much; that Serbs, too, have been uprooted from their homes and have suffered greatly in the conflicts of the past decade that Mr. Milosevic provoked.
But the cycle of violence has to end. The children of the Balkans, all of them, deserve the chance to grow up without fear. Serbs simply must free themselves of the notion that their neighbors must be their enemies. The real enemy is a poisonous hatred unleashed by a cynical leader, based on a distorted view of what constitutes real national greatness.
The United States has become greater as we have shed racism, as we have shed a sense of superiority, as we have become more committed to working together across the lines that divide us, as we have found other ways to define meaning and purpose in life. And so has every other country that has embarked on that course.
We stand ready, therefore, to embrace Serbia as a part of a new Europe if the people of Serbia are willing to invest and embrace that kind of future; if they are ready to build a Serbia, and a Yugoslavia, that is democratic and respects the rights and dignity of all people; if they are ready to join a world where people reach across the divide to find their common humanity and their prosperity.
This is the right vision and the right course. It is not only the morally right thing for America; it is the right thing for our security interests over the long run. It is the vision for which the veterans in this room struggled so valiantly, for which so many others have given their lives.
With your example to guide us, and with our Allies beside us, it is a vision that will prevail. And it is very, very much worth standing for.

Bill Clinton,"June 11, 1999","Interview With Jim Lehrer of PBS' ""NewsHour""","Mr. Lehrer. And now to President Clinton. Mr. President, welcome.
The President. Thank you, Jim. I'm glad to be here.
Balkan Peace Process
Mr. Lehrer. Is the peace process, the withdrawal of the Serb troops and the other matters, proceeding on schedule today?
The President. So far it's proceeding in an orderly way. The Serb forces are withdrawing. They're withdrawing in a fashion that appears to our commanders to be consistent with their commitment to be gone in the 11-day time period. And General Jackson is readying our forces to deploy.
Mr. Lehrer. When will that happen, do you think? First, NATO troops—when will they go in now?
The President. I think it will be quite soon. It's his decision, and they are—I think there are a number of factors that are going into his thinking, but they'll have to be in there pretty soon because they're determined not to let some big vacuum develop. But they have a lot of plans to make, and they're mapping them, starting with a strategy for demining, and then dealing with the refugees that are brought back and those that want to come back on their own. And they're working that. But I would expect it would be quite soon.
Russian Troops
Mr. Lehrer. What's your reading of this Russian troop movement today that caused such a turmoil? The Russian troops came from Bosnia into Serbia, and there was some idea that they may go into Kosovo. What's going on?
The President. Well, the last we heard was, I think, when Mr. Ivanov told Secretary Albright that they were just pre-positioning, but that they recognized that we had to work out the arrangements for their participation. And even as we speak, there are discussions going on about that.
Mr. Lehrer. Do you foresee a major problem developing over this?
The President. I don't really think so, but there are some factors I would imagine they'll have to work through. And I haven't received a detailed briefing. But, for example, we're going to have almost 30 countries this time in this operation, and I would expect that in each one of the zones of responsibility, the areas of responsibility, there will be multiple countries. The Russians, I think, would like to play a major role, but they understand we have to have unity of command under General Jackson. That's the sine qua non of the whole thing.
But we also know in every zone we have to have two things: First of all, there has to be the fact and the feeling of safety and security so the Kosovars will go home; secondly, in those sectors where there are Serbs, they have to know that we're committed to protecting them, too. And a lot of thought has been given to how that might best be done and how the Russians can make the strongest contribution there. So our commanders, their people, they're talking about it. They're talking it through, and I expect they'll resolve it.
NATO Airstrike Campaign
Mr. Lehrer. Mr. President, were you surprised that Milosevic hung in there as long as he did, for 78 days?
The President. Not after the beginning. When we started this, I thought there would be one of three possible scenarios. First of all, I absolutely reject the theory that some people have advanced that what he did was worse than he would have done if we hadn't bombed as early as we did. I just simply don't believe that. He had this plan laid out; he was going to carry it into effect last October. He didn't do it because of the threat of bombing.
So what I knew was that if he decided to behave as he had in Bosnia, that there would be a day or two of bombing, then we'd make this agreement that we made today, or a couple of days ago, and it would be over; but that there was a strong chance that it would not, because in the mind of Mr. Milosevic there was a big difference between Bosnia and Kosovo. Bosnia was something that he wanted badly that he didn't have. Kosovo was something that he had that he wanted to take absolute control of by running people out of.
So once he decided to take the bombing, I was not surprised that he took it for quite a long while, because he kept looking for ways to break the unity of NATO. He kept looking for ways to turn someone against what we were doing.
Of course, the third scenario was that the bombing never worked and we had to take even more aggressive measures. But I always thought there was a much better than 50-50 chance that this bombing campaign would work. And I am gratified that it has achieved our objectives.
Mr. Lehrer. What was it, or who was it, that convinced you that bombing alone would work?
The President. Well, you know, when I talked to the American people about this in the beginning, I made it clear that there was no way that any bombing campaign could literally physically extract every Serbian soldier and paramilitary operative and put them back out of Kosovo. But I knew that our people had made dramatic progress in the last few years, even since Desert Storm, in precision-guided weapons and in the capacity of our planes to deliver them and to avoid even fairly sophisticated antiaircraft operations. And I just felt that if we worked at it and we could hold the coalition together, that we'd be able to do enough damage that we could do it. And Secretary Cohen and General Shelton felt there was a better than 50-50 chance we could do it; Mr. Berger did.
Mr. Lehrer. Better than 50-50 was as good——
The President. Yes—Secretary Albright did. And I just—I've been dealing with Mr. Milosevic now a long time, you know, more than 6 years, and I think I have some understanding of the politics and the environment in Serbia. And I just felt if we kept pounding away that we could raise the price to a point where it would no longer make any sense for him to go on and where he could no longer maintain his position if he did.
And I regret that he required his people to go through what they have gone through, to lower their incomes as much as they've been lowered and to erode their quality of life as much as it's been eroded and even to have the civilian casualties which have been sustained, although they're far, far less than they were in Desert Storm after the bombing, for example. Still, I hate it. But what we did miraculously resulted in no combat air losses to our people— we did lose two fine Army airmen in training— and minimized the losses to their people, to their civilians. But it did a terrible amount of damage. And finally, they couldn't go on; it didn't make any sense.
Mr. Lehrer. Mr. President, as I'm sure you're aware, the fact of no casualties by NATO has been used as a criticism of the whole approach here—that yes, ethnic cleansing was bad in Kosovo; yes, we needed to do something; but it wasn't worth risking any American lives to do so.
The President. Well, now, first of all, I never said that, that it wasn't worth risking any lives. We did risk lives, and I think the American people should know that. Our pilots, particularly the pilots in our A-10's, they were quite frequently fired upon by people holding these shoulder missiles, and they would deliberately position themselves in populated areas where there were civilians living. And over and over again, our pilots risked their lives by avoiding firing back, when they could easily have taken those people out who were firing at them. But to do so would have killed civilians. So there was risk to the lives. I remind you, we lost two airplanes and had to go in there and rescue two pilots. So that's not true.
Secondly, if we had put a ground force in for an invasion, it still wouldn't be done today. That is, all this bombing we did, we would have had to do anyway. Let me take you back to Operation Desert Storm, where we deployed a half-million people in the theater; took, as I remember, 4 1/2 or 5 months to do it; bombed for 44 days there, but because of the terrain and the weather, they dropped more ordnance in 44 days than we did in our 79-day campaign.
So we would have had to do everything we have done to do this. I told the American people at the time that we could not have mounted and executed an invasion that would have stopped this ethnic cleansing, because at the time the Rambouillet talks broke down, when the Kosovars accepted it and the Serbs didn't, keep in mind, he already had 40,000 troops in and around Kosovo, and nearly 300 tanks. So no force—there was no way to mobilize and implant a force quick enough to turn it back.
And somehow the suggestion that our moral position would have been improved if only a few more Americans had died, I think is wrong. Believe me, fewer Serbs died than would die if we had had to invade. We would have had to deploy a force of about 200,000. We would have put them at great risk just getting them into the country. That was actually the biggest risk. I don't think the combat, once in the country, was nearly as big a risk as the problems of deploying into Kosovo.
But I just don't accept that. I don't think that—we moved aggressively. We were criticized by some people in the Congress and elsewhere for starting the bombing too soon. And those who say that we should have used ground forces, even if we had announced on day one we were going to use ground forces, it would have taken as long as this bombing campaign went on to deploy them, probably longer.
Mr. Lehrer. What about just the threat of ground forces? You were criticized—you and your fellow NATO leaders were criticized for taking it off the table at the very beginning, telling Milosevic all he had to do was hunker down.
The President. I was afraid that I had done that when I said to the American people that I did not intend to use ground forces. And shortly thereafter in an interview, I made it clear that I did not do that. And then repeatedly I said that, and I said I thought we ought to be planning for ground forces.
So I think the differences, for example, between the British position and ours and others were somewhat overstated, because we had done quite a lot of planning for a ground force, and we had made it explicit that we weren't taking the option off the table. And Chancellor Schroeder from Germany was reported as having done so. When I talked to him and examined the German text of what he'd said, it was obvious that there had been a little bit of overstatement there.
So I don't think—I think that the NATO— my own view is if this had not worked, NATO would have put ground forces in there and that we were determined not to lose this thing, that we were determined to reverse the ethnic cleansing. I think the Europeans were especially sensitive, as I was, to the fact that it took 4 years to mobilize an action against Bosnia and that there were all kinds of arguments used about it, including the fact that U.N. peacekeepers were there, diplomacy was going on, any action would have upset all that, and they didn't want that to happen this time.
So the truth is that this action against ethnic cleansing was hugely more rapid and more responsive than what was done in Bosnia. And that's why there won't be nearly as many lost lives.
President's Moral Authority
Mr. Lehrer. On a more personal basis, Mr. President, some suggest when this operation began that the Lewinsky impeachment matter had weakened your moral authority to lead the country in a difficult situation like this. Were they wrong?
The President. Oh, I think so. I think the American people have been very good to me, and my family's been very good to me. And we went through a process which resulted in a decision by the public and by the Congress that I should serve. No one—no thinking American wants to have a President of either party and any philosophy who cannot fully serve and does not fully do his job or her job. And so I did what I was hired to do by the American people. And I believe, as strongly as I can say, it was the right thing to do. It was the moral thing to do. And our children will have a better world because we have now stood against ethnic cleansing, and not only that, in this case, we're going to be able to reverse it and let those people go home.
Congressional Support for Airstrikes
Mr. Lehrer. What is your analysis of why, for instance, the overwhelming majority of the Republicans in the House of Representatives did not vote to support this air war in the beginning?
The President. Oh, I don't know. I prefer to be grateful for those who did support it. And quite a number did. And we had very good support, a minority of Republicans in the Senate, but a substantial number supported us in a very vocal and effective way and were prepared to go even further to ground forces, as you know.
So I'm grateful for the support that we did have. A lot of very serious, thoughtful Republicans said they thought we were doing the right thing. Speaker Hastert voted with us, and I would remind you that we got a very good vote early on, with the help of the Speaker, for the deployment of American forces in a peacekeeping operation. And then they voted to support the troops and to fund the air war. So I'm grateful for that, and I leave it to others to interpret why they did what they did.
Criticism of President
Mr. Lehrer. Senator Hagel, Republican from Nebraska, who voted for——
The President. He did.
Mr. Lehrer. ——when it was in the Senate, was asked why there were so many Republicans who were not supporting this, and he said it had to do with trust. And he said, quote, ""This President has debased the one currency we each have in this business, and that's trust, and he'll never get it back,"" end quote. That's what— his explanation as to why Congress didn't support you any more than they did.
The President. I think that's pretty self-serving: ""I'm not going to do what's right for my country because I don't like Bill Clinton."" You know, that's—I think that's pretty self-serving.
You know, I was gratified when, a few years ago, a historian of the Presidency said that I had kept a higher percentage of my commitments to the American people than any of the last five Presidents who preceded me—an academic man at the time I'd never even met. And so I think that that element of the party devoted the better part of 7, 8 years almost— now 7 years, more than 7 years—to attacking me personally because they knew the American people agree with my ideas and the direction in which I was taking the country. And on one occasion, much to my eternal regret, I gave them a little ammunition. But I have been trustworthy in my public obligations to the American people, and I have been trustworthy in my dealings with them.
I have—I don't agree with them, and when I don't, I tell them. But you know, we've gotten quite a lot done when they have put aside their personal frustration in not owning the White House. The truth is, those folks ought to lighten up. They believe they had—they say—a lot of my Republican friends, you know, they rail against the entitlement programs. They don't like the entitlement programs. But the truth is, for a long time they thought the White House was an entitlement program. They never thought there would be another Democratic President in their lifetime. And they're all gearing up again because they think they're entitled to the parking spaces outside here and to the office space and all.
And this job here and this house, it doesn't belong to the Republican Party or to the Democratic Party. The American people own this place. And we're all just here for a little while. And they ought to just relax and realize I'm a temporary tenant and that we're all hired hands. And we ought to work for the American people, do our best, have the elections, and then let the people make their decision and go on again.
I think—that's what a lot of this is. They were—they've just been mad ever since I won because a lot of them really never believed there would be another Democrat in their lifetime. And attacking—if you can't beat somebody on the ideas and the issues and the philosophy and the direction of the country and if the country is doing very well, so you just get madder and madder when the country does well, then all you have left is a personal attack and say, ""Oh, I just don't trust the guy.""
But that's not good for America. And you know, I don't attack them personally. I'm not going to get into it. My door is always open; my phone is always open; and I'm going to keep working with them in every way I can.
Mr. Lehrer. Since, just in the last 24 hours, since this thing has come to this critical concluding point, people who were criticizing this action, not just Republicans but pundits and people in the foreign policy establishment, they're still criticizing you. They—does that surprise you?
The President. Gosh, no. I find that in Washington, in this sort of, what Professor Deborah Tannen has called this culture of critique, if I make a mistake, people want me to admit that I made a mistake. And I have tried to do that. I think it's quite therapeutic. It's hard to do, and I had to get hit upside the head to do it. But I did it, and it was good for me. But if they turn out to be wrong, they just change the subject or just keep insisting that it was, you know, just a fluke.
I think the most important thing is, were we right to take a stand in Kosovo against ethnic cleansing? Were we right to do it more quickly that we did in Bosnia? Should we set up— have a principle that guides us which says: Okay, in a world where people are fighting all the time over racial or ethnic or religious problems, we can't tell everybody they've got to get along; we can't stop every fight, like the fight between Eritrea and Ethiopia, or the struggles in Chechnya; but where we can, at an acceptable cost—that is, without risking nuclear war or some other terrible thing—we ought to prevent the slaughter of innocent civilians and the wholesale uprooting of them because of their race, their ethnic background, or the way they worship God?
I think that's an important principle, myself. I think it's a noble thing. I think the United States did a good thing. Now, they may argue that I did it—went about it in the wrong way. They may—I've answered that, I hope. At least I'm confident that I did the right thing in the right way. And that's what—historians can judge that based on the long-term consequences of this. But I believe what we did was a good and decent thing. And I believe that it will give courage to people throughout the world, and I think it will give pause to people who might do what Mr. Milosevic has done throughout the world.
I feel awful that we were not equipped and able and on the job to stop what happened in Rwanda. And since then, I have done everything I could to train this Africa Crisis Response team, military from different countries in Africa, so that if that starts again—God forbid—somewhere, they can move in and stop it.
I think the world—the freedom-loving nations of the world need to be organized to try to stop this sort of thing. I mean, don't you think it's interesting that we're on the verge of a new century, and you're going to have all these millennial celebrations, and we're all going to talk about how 100,000 websites get added to the Internet every day, and we're going to unlock the mysteries of the human gene, and what a modern, rapid world we're going to be living in, and here we are bogged down everywhere in the world by the oldest problems of human society: We fear people who are different from us; pretty soon we hate them; once we start hating them, we dehumanize them; then it's easy to kill them.
Now, it seems to me if we're going to reap the promise of the 21st century, if we don't want to go to Europe or some other place and have a bunch of Americans die in a bloody war, where we can nip this stuff in the bud we ought to do it. And that's what I've tried to do. And I think it was the right thing to do.
President's Accomplishments and Goals
Mr. Lehrer. As we sit here right now, Mr. President, is this the best moment of your Presidency?
The President. Oh, no, I wouldn't say that. I don't know—you know, there's so many things that have happened here at home that have been important to me, passing the economic plan, passing the Brady bill and the assault weapons ban. So many things have happened internationally, the role that I was fortunate to be able to play in the peace process in the Middle East and in Ireland. But this could have the biggest long-term positive consequences if we do it right.
But frankly, I haven't—sometimes people say, ""Well, do you feel vindicated?"" The answer is no. I think America has been vindicated. I think what we stand for has been vindicated. But keep in mind, there have been lots of times in the past where people win a conflict and then squander the peace. So a lot of our work is still ahead of us. We've got to get those folks home. We've got to get those landmines up. We've got to work out these details on who's going to be involved in this peacekeeping mission. We then have to get this—we've got to organize police forces and a civil government for the Kosovars.
And then the really big thing over the long run—our European friends want to take the lead in this, but we ought to help them—we've got to get the World Bank and all these other people involved in a development plan for the Balkans that involves not just Kosovo but Macedonia, Albania, Bulgaria, Romania, and, I hope some day, Serbia, if they have a government that respects freedom and democracy and human rights, so that these people have something pulling them together instead of these ancient ethnic troubles pulling them apart.
Now, if we get all that done, it might be perhaps the most satisfying thing because it might prove that people can lay down their hatreds of people who are different.
I basically think free people will figure out a way to make the most of their lives and work out their problems if they can get the rules of engagement right. That's why I gave somewhat of an extended answer to what you said about the Republicans, because I think—you know, differences are good. Nobody's got the whole truth. But you've got to get the rules of engagement right. And I think what we did in Kosovo was profoundly important.
Mr. Lehrer. Mr. President, thank you very much.

Bill Clinton,"September 28, 1999",Press Briefing by Joe Lockhart,"The Briefing Room
1:38 P.M. EDT
MR. LOCKHART: Good afternoon. Let me make one announcement. The President tomorrow will go and speak to the IMF/World Bank annual meeting. I expect he'll arrive at the Marriott-Wardman Park Hotel by 1:45 p.m., speak somewhere in the vicinity of 2:00 p.m. He will be introduced there by the Secretary of Treasury, Larry Summers. I expect the speech to focus on the importance of international debt relief, and translating this debt relief into poverty alleviation for the world's poorest countries.
That's it for announcements. Questions?
Q: Joe, the President today talked about the American people granting him ""unmerited forgiveness."" Why does he feel that he doesn't deserve to be forgiven? And secondly, what indication does he have that the American people have forgiven him?
MR. LOCKHART: Let me preempt that and many other questions by saying I have no further insight into what he said. I'll leave you to interpret it.
Q: Joe, on the Liberian front, what is the executive order exactly do?
MR. LOCKHART: Let me do a quick check. The decision to grant this extension means that people who were present -- Liberians who were present in the United States as of September 29th, 1999, will not be subject to deportation for one year. So it is just an extension of, I think, what was an 18-month TPS. I think it's 18 months; it's extending for a year.
Q: So what happens after that year's time?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, I mean, obviously, this is in some way a reflection of what's going on there, so I think we'll have to make an assessment at the end of the year.
Q: Joe, not asking for interpretation, but is there anything you can tell us about how often he continues to meet with the ministers? Because he mentioned --
MR. LOCKHART: No. I know from what he said today that he continues to meet with them, but I don't know how often.
Q: Joe, on the taxes and the budget, there seems to be movement on the Hill now to attach tax provisions to other related legislation -- minimum wage has a tax provision. Also, the Republicans announced this morning some managed care proposals that would also have tax breaks in them. How do you feel about either of those proposals and that general approach?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, I think -- take minimum wage. Minimum wage has broad support in both Houses. It has bipartisan support and ought to be taken up on its merits. I think there will be no back door for large, unpaid-for tax cuts. The President wants to do this in a straightforward way that deals with Social Security, Medicare tax relief, education. And despite his efforts to move forward, we continually are met with more gimmicks, more techniques to get around making some tough choices.
So I think minimum wage should stand on its own; the patients' bill of rights certainly should stand on its own, given the amount of support it has among Republicans in both Houses. And we can do middle class tax relief in the context of how we spend the surplus, but we should do it in a straightforward way.
Q: Well, some of the tax breaks that they're talking about attaching to the minimum wage aren't large. Are you saying you're against any tax breaks that are attached to the minimum wage bill?
MR. LOCKHART: I'm saying I'm not going to try to forecast what they're going to do. Minimum wage ought to pass because it's the right policy and there is strong support within both parties. As far as tax cuts, if they want to put forward tax cuts they've got to tell us how they're going to pay for them.
Q: But other White House officials have said that they would be open to some kind of tax cuts --
MR. LOCKHART: Again, we'll have to see what they are. But if this is a way, as in what I saw this morning in some of the comments, to try to work back in some of the other elements of the tax cut that the President's vetoed, then they've got to come forward in a way that shows us how they'll pay for it.
Q: Joe, today Senator Bradley proposed a $65-billion universal health insurance program that would require coverage of all children and offer subsidies to families who couldn't afford it. Does that sound like something the President would like? Would he endorse that?
MR. LOCKHART: I think the President has been working incrementally to improve health coverage for all Americans to try to get the millions of Americans who are uninsured, particularly children, on the insurance roll. I haven't seen the proposal that former Senator Bradley has put forward, so I can't analyze it or give you the President's analysis of it.
But given the process we're going forward through here, I mean, I think the concern would be how you pay for it in the context of the overall budget. So I haven't seen it, so I don't know.
Q: Well, in general, given what the President proposed seven years ago, does it sound like a good idea?
MR. LOCKHART: As a policy goal, I think there's no one who believes that we should have uninsured Americans. The question is how you get there and what the best way to get there is.
Q: The President's being criticized by some Republicans for spending too much money on his travels, government money. What's your response?
MR. LOCKHART: It's very similar to my response when I was asked about this last week. The trips that the GAO study focused on were somewhat unique, particularly Africa, in the costs that were incurred because of the lack of infrastructure there. The bulk of the cost is, as the report does indicate for the Pentagon, as far as security, physical security, logistics, communications, all of which are needs of the President when he travels, and they're needs of the President whether it's a Democrat or a Republican.
I cited a trip last week that you're probably familiar with, when President Reagan went to Grenada when the cost was something like $1 million an hour. But I think at the time that trip was appropriate, given the circumstances that had transpired.
Q: Would you have said so at the time?
MR. LOCKHART: I wasn't standing here at the time. (Laughter.) Anyway -- but I think there's --
Q: When you look at the lists of people you take on these trips, like 60 staffers and so forth, isn't that a bit much?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, you know --
Q: I mean, China, I think you took 100.
MR. LOCKHART: Helen, let me answer the question. Let's look at who we take. We take seven or eight staffers whose job is to take care of you all, because we bring 150 or 200 press. That's important. We take three or four staffers to take care of the congressional delegation. We welcome members of Congress to take these trips. They're very important, as far as deepening our understanding and relationship with countries, as far as deepening economic opportunities, which translates into jobs -- which is generally what most members of Congress, when they go back home, talk about it being their top priority.
So these are very important trips. When you go -- there's a big difference between taking a trip to Germany, where there are U.S. bases and the military can travel 50 miles, as opposed to having to travel 5,000 miles to provide the support. It is no accident that the three members of the Senate, when they asked for this report, picked the trips that did not involve going to places where -- going to Japan, or going to Germany or someplace in Europe where we have a military presence. I think they were looking to score some political points here. You can be the judge of whether they did or not.
Q: Joe, has the scrutiny caused you to re-evaluate the planning of --
MR. LOCKHART: No.
Q: -- any future trips?
MR. LOCKHART: No.
Q: No changes whatsoever?
Q: Joe, what's the U.S. reaction to the bombings in Chechnya that have been getting some protests from European capitals? And what has the contact been with Moscow on the issue?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, you have seen, the President met in Auckland with the Prime Minister. There have been contacts at other levels, through diplomatic channels. I think we're concerned, certainly, with the escalation, and would view any resumption of general hostilities in Chechnya as something that would be a threat to the stability of the region.
We have, in our conversations, urged political dialogue. Prime Minister Putin has indicated both in our conversations and publicly that he wants a dialogue. And we've underscored the importance for everyone involved to act responsibly, and to respect human rights, and not to use disproportionate force or target civilians.
Q: Joe, can I just be clear on the tax cuts? You said the minimum wage bill and the patients' bill of rights bill should stand on their own. But is the key issue whether or not the tax cuts are paid for? Are you ruling out having tax cuts linked --
MR. LOCKHART: No, I'm not ruling out -- and, in fact, we've passed minimum wage bills in the past with some tax provisions. I think this concern is that we don't try to use the back door of a popular measure among Democrats and Republicans to do something else. If there are reasonable provisions like in the past, we'll take a look at them.
Q: So you're saying the provisions that are tied to kind of implementing the minimum wage, these tax breaks for small businesses or business lunches, or whatever, that you don't have a problem with?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, I don't want to take any specific one and say we're going to endorse it or we're not going to endorse it. We have in the past, certainly. They've come packaged and we were happy to sign it. But I think there was some suggestion in one of the articles this morning that they were going to take a much broader approach to take minimum wage and put large provisions of their tax bill on to that. And I think that would create certainly more concern.
Q: Joe, last week the President used the word ""red-neck"" to describe hunters who he characterized as ""a bunch of big, muscle-bound guys in plaid shirts waiting for deer season."" Does the President believe that gun owners are less sophisticated than he is, or does Mr. Clinton regret his choice of words as perhaps stereotyping?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, obviously not since the President is a hunter.
Next.
Q: Joe, this morning you were asked about Dan Quayle leaving the Republican side. What does the President feel about that?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, I think the President has indicated on a number of occasions that he thinks campaigns, when they're positive in nature they're exercises in ideas and policies on where you want the country to go forward. And I think anyone should be somewhat disappointed when someone takes themselves out of the running not because they think the public has rejected their ideas or the public hasn't connected with their ideas, but for the stated reason of they don't have enough resources.
It says something about the way the campaign system works. It says something about why we need to reform campaign finance, and it says something about the Senate leaders and the House leaders acceding to the will of the American people, and to the majority in both Houses in pushing campaign finance reform.
Q: But would the President be open to one of the things that Dan Quayle suggested in terms of changing the campaign finance laws if it came as part of a package with the other reforms the President wants, like getting rid of soft money? I'm talking specifically about raising the $1,000 limit. I can't remember of you guys are on record for or against that.
MR. LOCKHART: Let me check on that. I honestly don't know whether it would be something we'd be hard and fast against if it was in the context of a soft money ban and some other things on issue advertises --
Q: Can you check on that?
MR. LOCKHART: Yes, I will. Because I have something in the back of my mind that has -- I know there were some proposals floating around a while ago that would raise them from $1,000 to like $5,000, I think. But I just don't know if that ever fit into McCain-Feingold or if we took a position publicly.
Q: Joe, Mr. Ecevit is reportedly going to be asking both for the U.S. to back $5 billion worth of housing construction bonds for Turkey to try and get over the earthquake damage, and also for an easing of the textile quota, an increase of the Turkish quota. Is there going to be any positive word on either of those?
MR. LOCKHART: I'm certain that both of those subjects will be discussed in detail and our excellent briefers who come down later this afternoon can address that.
Q: A year after the President admitted he had sinned in last year's prayer breakfast, is it your assessment that relations between the White House and Congress are back to normal, Joe?
MR. LOCKHART: It's hard to define normal. Defining it broadly, yes. I think that what we have now is, we've got a good, old-fashioned policy debate going on. The Republicans have made the centerpiece of their agenda a very large and we think misguided tax cut which will squeeze out Social Security and Medicare. The President, on the other hand, has made education and extending Social Security and Medicare the top priority and the centerpiece of his agenda. And we're having a debate -- the President has taken it to the country, Congress has gone through their long summer recess to the country. And we're in the process of resolving that.
Q: I thought they said they weren't going to do a big tax cut. They said the centerpiece of what they're doing from now until the end of the year is protecting Social Security and not letting him raise taxes on tobacco and passing --
MR. LOCKHART: I think the question was looking back over the last year. Has it -- and I think it's returned to normal because we Democrats -- the President as leader of the Democratic Party, Democrats have staked out one position; Republicans have staked out another, and we're going to try to resolve it sometime, hopefully, in the next three weeks and -- what -- two days.
Q: Joe, given the unlikelihood that you'll get the taxes on tobacco that you would like, in order to get the spending programs you want you would have to not set aside 100 percent of the Social Security trust fund that you'd like. I don't know if it would be 90 percent or 80 percent, but it would be more than the 62 percent that you talked about earlier. Would you be willing to settle for less than 100 percent --
MR. LOCKHART: I think our view is that we don't have to do that, that it's a false choice. And we're going to continue pushing for the tax cut and we're going to continue to push the Republicans to make the tough choices. There are ways to go after this -- if they don't want a tobacco tax, they can move forward and propose some other way that can close the gap there, whether it's some cut -- I mean, there's always places to go and look.
I think it's too easy to say, oh, let's just go into the Social Security surplus, get it done, get a bunch of bills signed and go home. The President believes we have a much larger and broader challenge and he wants Congress -- reluctantly, we'll move forward and extend this exercise three weeks, and in that three weeks he wants them to get their work done.
Q: So is he flatly saying you will not --
Q: I mean, certainly you knew that tobacco tax was going to be a none-starter. Are you saying it's all up to them?
MR. LOCKHART: Listen, we have put forward a budget that doesn't bust the caps and doesn't go into the Social Security surplus. We have loophole closings that will generate revenue. We've got a tobacco tax. If there are other ideas, they should come forward with them.
Q: What I'm saying is, in the interest of compromise, if you know that the tobacco tax is a none-starter and you still want that spending, don't you have to come up with an alternative way to pay for it?
MR. LOCKHART: No, I suggest that they've got some work to do. They have yet to finish their work on the 13 bills. They've still got some things to do. And I think it's incumbent upon them, if they believe ours are none-starters, to put forward some ideas that might work.
Q: They don't want your spending.
Q: What you're saying is that they should take all the heat for whatever cuts need to be made.
MR. LOCKHART: Well, no. If they have an idea of how to do it -- I mean, we've put forward a budget that makes the investments and doesn't take the step of going and spending the Social Security surplus. And it's a challenge for them to meet. They don't appear to be able to meet it, but there's still some time.
Q: Is going into the Social Security surplus --
Q: Joe, this is to pay for spending they don't want.
MR. LOCKHART: Mara, there is spending that we want and there's spending that they want. And you can do a lot of work on that front and get to the position where you can find acceptable areas of compromise. But you need to engage and not do things like make the census an emergency and create a new month in the calendar.
Q: Is going into the Social Security surplus non-negotiable from the White House point of view?
MR. LOCKHART: The President has made it very clear, he wants to work with them. We don't have to do this. We don't have to move forward and go into the Social Security surplus. He's made that point as clear as he knows how to make it. I've tried to make it clear here, and we're going to, hopefully, in the next three weeks find some way around the situations the Republicans have created for themselves.
Q: Joe, you've spoken of agreeing to three weeks, to kick it down the road for a few weeks. Aside from doing that, is there any engaging going on, or just more positioning?
MR. LOCKHART: Sure. There's lots of discussion going on on the individual appropriations bills. We're working with them, with the Senate Finance Committee on Medicare. The President -- as he said, his door is open, and is ready to work with Congress in the best way he can. And we look forward to doing it.
Q: Has he actually invited -- will he call Senator Lott and Hastert and invite them up here to start talking about a compromise?
MR. LOCKHART: We've got to have some basis for sitting down and working in a straightforward way that sort of clears away the gimmicks, clears away the budget creations. We haven't seen that yet, but there's -- the President believes there's plenty of time.
Q: Well, wait a second. You're saying they have to do something first before it will be the right time to invite them up. What exactly do they have to do?
MR. LOCKHART: I think there's got to be some clear indication that they want to work, and do a budget that's straightforward, and they want to talk about the issues, Social Security and Medicare, in addition to appropriations. And if that's the case, I think we'd be glad to talk to them.
Q: Well, speaking about that, what was the result of the meetings with Roth on Friday? Didn't Podesta and --
MR. LOCKHART: I think Senator Roth and his staff made it clear to the Finance Committee that they wanted to move forward, and they're in the process of putting -- they're putting some hearings together, I think.
Q: Right, but when your folks went up there, did you get the sense that that was the vehicle for some bigger compromise?
MR. LOCKHART: We got the sense that Senator Roth was serious about getting something done. And we're quite anxious to work with him.
Q: Joe, can we get back to the IMF speech tomorrow? Can you give us an idea, is there some -- I mean, he's talked before about the need for debt relief. Is there some specific proposal he's going to come with?
MR. LOCKHART: No, he's going to talk about the budget amendment he set up last week on debt relief. That's a substantial proposal that came out of the Cologne G-7 meeting. I think he'll also, in that speech, talk about the importance of the international financial institution's work around the world and how far we've come in the last year as far as the global economy.
Some of these speeches that the President has given over the last two or three years about international financial architecture, reform, transparency, seems somewhat abstract to people, but if you look at where large portions of the economy were last year, all of the work that was done in the world, moving from last year to this year, it becomes more real for people, I think.
Q: Yesterday was the deadline for a decision on the steel tariffs. Any idea when we're going to hear something?
MR. LOCKHART: There are complicated and difficult issues involved in that matter. They are still being worked. The President will get a recommendation at some point from his advisors and make a decision, but I can't predict when.
Q: -- from what the ITC Commissioner suggested?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, the ITC commissioners were split on that issue. But he will make what he thinks is the best decision, weighing all of the different elements, but I can't give you a timetable for when that will be.
Q: Archer this morning said that he wouldn't consider bringing up the tobacco tax for a vote, but that they necessarily haven't ruled out this idea of changing the distribution payment for the Earned Income Tax Credit. Summers has spoken against that in the past. Is the White House still adamantly opposed to any EITC changes?
MR. LOCKHART: We certainly are. Let's look at what they tried to do here. There was a very large tax cut that disproportionately provided benefits to the best off in America. They have just pushed forward a $64-million windfall on royalties to the oil companies, and how do they pay for it? They want to delay payments to people who are on EITC . You know, that's not a hard one.
Thank you.

Bill Clinton,"October 22, 1999",Press Briefing by Joe Lockhart,"12:25 P.M. EDT
MR. LOCKHART: Good afternoon.
Q: Hi.
MR. LOCKHART: Welcome to the briefing. Questions from our esteemed members of the press corps?
Q: Has the administration been in touch with anybody in Russia about Chechnya, what's happened there?
MR. LOCKHART: Yes. There have been discussions, primarily from the embassy there, the ambassador, to Russian counterparts. We have been in touch on a regular basis over the last weeks, and have expressed our concern about the escalation of violence in Chechnya, and we have been in touch today. I expect there to be other contacts. We'll be talking to them on all diplomatic levels.
We are at this point trying to ascertain the facts in this case. What's clear is there has been a tragic -- there is a tragic situation there with terrible loss of life. But there are conflicting reports and statements on the incident, and we are working hard, now, to find out what the facts are.
But we will continue, regardless of this incident, to make clear to the Russians and to both parties, that there is no way to find a purely military solution to this situation. There needs to be a constructive political dialogue, and that both parties need to engage in that dialogue.
Q: Would the President pick up the telephone and call President Yeltsin about this? Is this something that rises to that level?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, the President recently wrote to President Yeltsin on this subject, expressing our concerns and expressing the principles that Strobe Talbott expressed in his testimony Wednesday on Capitol Hill -- that he has recently, as has been reported, heard back from President Yeltsin. But this is something that we are concerned about, and we have expressed both publicly and privately on many different levels with the Russians and we will continue to do so.
Q: The Russians say that they are not behind the blast in Grozny marketplace. Do you accept that?
MR. LOCKHART: We are trying to ascertain the facts. There are conflicting reports. There are different versions that have come out from different parts of the Russian government. So we don't have a conclusive answer right at this point.
Q: Joe, is it fair to say that U.S. concern is greater today than it was before this incident?
MR. LOCKHART: Our concern has been -- we have raised our concern repeatedly in the last months about the escalation. It is certainly -- it is certainly troubling to see this kind of loss of life, and we have repeated to the Russians that we don't -- that we believe that a constructive political dialogue is the only way to end this, that we should not repeat the mistakes of 1994 and 1996. I think, you know, Prime Minister Putin is in Helsinki now meeting with the EU Chair and hearing a message very much like the message that we have sent, which is that they need to act in a way that finds a political solution and act in a way that conforms with the international conventions in a situation like this.
Q: Is someone going to be talking about something today on this?
MR. LOCKHART: Not that I know of. I'll check over there but not that I know of. I've talked to him this morning, but I'm not aware that he's going out to make a statement of any kind.
Q: Joe, what is the U.S. policy towards Chechnya, that it's an integral part of Russia or that they have the right to rebel?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, we recognize that this is a part of Russia. But I think, to take a step back, Strobe Talbott made several points when he testified Wednesday and it very much underlines what our policy is.
First, we believe that the spread of violence in the region and the escalation of violence is contrary to everyone's interest, except those who rely on violence to meet their political ends -- and that includes the separatists. Second, the last war in Chechnya, 1994, demonstrated there cannot be a purely military solution to this problem. That means Russia has to engage in a serious political dialogue.
Third, all parties -- and all parties here that are involved should avoid indiscriminate disproportionate use of force. Fourth, Russia's progress towards developing a civil society, democracy and the rule of law will be in jeopardy if it permits a backlash against its citizens because of their ethnicity or religion.
And, finally, in defending their own territory, Russia should take special care to respect the independence and security concerns of neighboring states, especially Georgia and Azerbaijan.
So I think he, in testifying Wednesday, he laid out what our basic views on the situation are. But, obviously, you've heard from a number of quarters in the last months a real concern about the escalation.
Q: Do you anticipate a U.S. and NATO response to similar to that which followed the market bombing in Sarajevo? I mean, I realize it's a different situation, but can you explain why?
MR. LOCKHART: I think it is impossible to try to compare those two situations.
Q: Mr. Lockhart, could you please confirm if President Clinton will be in Greece November 13th?
MR. LOCKHART: Have we put the schedule out for that trip?
MR. TOIV: Not officially, yet, no.
MR. LOCKHART: Not officially, I can't confirm that, but the schedule is coming soon.
Q: Joe, is there any progress on the budget talks this morning?
MR. LOCKHART: The budget talks. They met -- I think they've broken up or are in the process of breaking up. I'm not sure if this is just for a lunchtime break or they're getting back together. I talked to a couple of our people in the room. And they went in this morning with the appropriators and our budget team. They spent several hours discussing the issues. It started as a kind of general discussion of where we are in the process. And then they went through a series of particular issues, notably many of the objectionable language that's in some of the bills, particularly the Interior bill, the so-called environmental riders.
I think what is encouraging for our side is that we're moving forward on a workmanlike basis. We're doing this in a comprehensive way. It's not 15 different meetings in different places, going bill by bill. This is the appropriators sitting together, looking at the picture as a whole, which we believe is a prerequisite for getting this done.
On the discouraging front, you know, it's hard to know what's happening with those who are not in the room. The influence of those who want to play politics with this, rather than to get a deal done, is well-known. You know, I think Congressman DeLay has been a frequent visitor in front of any camera where the tape is moving, to make his points.
And I think it's important for our side to know who's calling the shots here. We want to get something done, we want to work with them, we want to work in a comprehensive way. There are certainly those who agree with that, who are moving forward in that way. But there are certainly forces within the majority party who would rather play politics here.
Q: Do you suspect that Delay calling the shots?
MR. LOCKHART: You know, I suspect that we'll find out as we move forward. There is certainly some evidence that that's the case; I don't know that anyone knows for sure, and we'll find out.
Q: Did the President -- you've mentioned it several times, did the President ask the leadership at this meeting Tuesday night to put the ads away. Did they mention that in any way?
MR. LOCKHART: I don't think there was any -- it was not reported to me that there was any discussion, per se, of the ads. I think certainly the President tried to make the point that it's hard for us to move forward in a process where the political institutional arm of the Republican Party is out spreading disinformation. And it is obvious disinformation. You only have to go as far as the CBO to know that.
It's a breathtaking attempt to recreate history but, I think, the people in the room looking at the numbers know the numbers. And, you know, we can get something done, we can have political fights but, at the end of the day, there has to be a commitment from both sides to get a deal done here. We are committed to getting it done. The people who are in the room with us, we believe, are committed to getting it done and we will just have to see if both sides can deliver.
Q: You mentioned the environmental riders also. Hastert said last night that he wants to try to avoid putting that kind of thing on the appropriations bill -- on a TV show, he said last night. Did you get any response from them on that? Have any of those been taken off? Is that --
MR. LOCKHART: None that I know of. In fact, there was some discussion about how many there were. We sent up a letter that indicated we hadn't -- there were 19 objectionable riders, you know, language-based riders. There was some debate over that number, but I think there was agreement, upon reviewing our original letter, that that's the universe of language problems we have.
Q: -- appropriations?
MR. LOCKHART: Yes, I think it's -- no, I'm sorry, that's on Interior. That's just on Interior. I don't have an overall number. But Interior, I think, is the main -- it's certainly in volume, that there's important -- you know, there's obviously an important language problem on CJS, as far as U.N. arrears, so I don't want to say that because there's more on one, there aren't other important ones. But as far as volume, this is the one that has the most area problem.
You know, if the Speaker of the House says that he wants to get some of these extraneous things off the bills, that's a sign of progress. Now what's important is whether we'll be able to deliver that and get the work done in the group that's meeting now.
Q: Joe, what's your evidence? You say there's some evidence that DeLay is calling the shots. What's your evidence of that?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, you know, we had a meeting here Tuesday night. And primarily the way we've moved from between then and today were a series of news conferences up on the Hill. So we'll have to find out.
Q: Just that he is apparently violating the agreement made between the President and --
MR. LOCKHART: No. No, I think --
Q: -- criticize?
MR. LOCKHART: No. He is free to criticize. The open question is whether that is his criticism, speaking for himself, or whether the strategy as he has articulated of bringing the Democrats to their knees is the strategy of the Republican Party. That is not a strategy that is conducive to getting a deal. That is not a strategy that's looking after the interests of the American people. It is a strategy that is designed for maximum political advantage -- and in that environment, if that is the overall guiding principle of the Republicans, this is going to be a long, tough battle.
Q: Joe, I could have sworn I just heard the President say you guys are going to turn the other cheek. It sounds like you're really so angry about this.
MR. LOCKHART: I have said, our guys are there, they're in the room, they're talking. We are working through these issues. The only question is what is going on in the room, if that's real, if it represents where the Republican Party, where the majority party in Congress wants to be.
Q: Well, Joe, isn't some of the rhetoric -- I mean, isn't it on both sides? I mean, yesterday you accused them of wanting more guns and less police officers, suggested that there's a slight possibly they were --
MR. LOCKHART: Listen, all I'd say on that front is I would have been glad to not do a lot of talking about the budget and would have, if everyone wanted to, abide by the spirit of what came out of Tuesday night. They were barely out of the room Wednesday when we had them making, once again, the absolutely outrageous charge that they hadn't spent the Social Security surplus and somehow we had.
You know, I'm not going to stand by and let charges like that go unanswered because there is ample evidence that indicates that the situation is just the opposite, and I will keep saying that from now until this process is over with. I think the proof is in the commitment to getting the work done. We are up in the room, we want to get this done, we are working with the appropriators in the room and the question is, will we be able to do it.
Q: Joe, what is the status on three points of Latin America? The status of Central America's reconstruction program, number one. Number two, the United States will be delivering to Panama the Canal, and the concern about the government of Panama's ability to manage the Canal under the continued government institutions, corruption and old boy network. And, third, fast track approval and if free trade -- America is going to be a reality as President Clinton has --
MR. LOCKHART: I don't really have anything on the first. On the second -- I don't have an update on the first question. On the second issue, we have worked very closely over the last 22 years with the government of Panama, with the Panama Canal Commission and we are satisfied that the hand over will go forward in a straightforward way and that the Commission will do a good job of running the Canal and that our interests are protected.
On fast track, the President has made clear often how important fast track authority is to securing free trade agreements around the world, including near home. We will continue to push for that, but I don't have a near-term prescription for how we will work that through Congress.
Q: Joe, partial birth abortion, do you know when it's going to be vetoed and will it be private or a ceremony?
MR. LOCKHART: I have no idea. It's not here yet.
Q: Is it likely to be a ceremonial veto or just a private --
MR. LOCKHART: I'm not willing to speculate.
Q: Joe, is the White House confident that Mrs. Clinton doesn't have any access to any lists that could provide, you know, fundraising -- names of fundraisers, likely targets for fundraising?
MR. LOCKHART: Access to what kind of lists?
Q: Well, the database, for example Any kinds of lists, visitors logs, anything that might provide --
MR. LOCKHART: I would put that question to her campaign. I don't know anything about that.
Q: Do you want to say anything on the banking bill?
MR. LOCKHART: Sure. I mean, I think, obviously, the President is very pleased with the work that Secretary Summers, Gene Sperling and some of their fine staff did late into the night, working in a very cooperative way with leading Democrats and Republicans on the Hill. We had a number of issues that we felt, as we went into these final negotiations, that were very important as we moved to try to modernize the banking system in this country.
I think a lot of attention got focused, as we got near the end, on issues of privacy. We got a lot of work done there. There's still more work, as we go into the future, to do, but I think we secured significant work on things like notice and choice and enforceability, and also on allowing states to go further, which was an issue that tied things up for a while.
On CRA, the President made very clear he was committed to not moving forward unless there was an absolute commitment to community investment among banking companies. And the agreement reflects that commitment. Banks that have bad records as far as community investment will not be able to enjoy the opportunities and advantages that this law sets forth.
I think overall, getting away from the specific issues, the winners here are the U.S. economy, that we'll have banking institutions that will have the flexibility to be competitive going into the next century; and consumers, who will be able to -- what is that?
Q: The concert --
MR. LOCKHART: Oh, the concert. Sorry, I thought it was like -- I thought someone was getting bored with the answers, so they were beating the drum. (Laughter.) And consumers, who will have expanded choice and a stronger financial system here at home.
Q: Joe, can I go back to this question about the First Lady? What's the law here? What are the rules here on the First Lady's access to White House data that might benefit her campaign?
MR. LOCKHART: There is an exploratory committee that she has set up. You should ask them.
Q: Well, no. I mean, as the White House spokesman, I want to ask you whether there's a firewall or something that --
MR. LOCKHART: Of course there is, but you're asking me a legal question that I clearly don't know the answer to, so we can continue this and I won't have the answer, or we can move on.
Q: What about Social Security? Somebody's going to brief us on this today?
MR. LOCKHART: Yes, later today, 3:30 p.m. or 4:00 p.m., I think Mr. Sperling and Mr. Apfel.
Q: You want to take that question, and get back to me?
MR. LOCKHART: No, I think you should go ask the question of the appropriate place. Once you've done that, maybe I can look at it.
Q: What's the appropriate place to ask that question?
MR. LOCKHART: The exploratory committee.
Q: But the White House rules on --
MR. LOCKHART: Listen, I don't know the rules. You can check at Counsel's Office. You all know the answer to this, so why don't we just move on.
Q: I don't know the answer to it.
MR. LOCKHART: Okay, well, check with some of your colleagues.
Q: Joe, the reason for it is that a fundraising invitation was sent to Johnny Chung. The DNC's -- and all the Democratic fund organizations say his name is being purged from their lists.
MR. LOCKHART: Right.
Q: Has his name been purged from the White House database, the White House's --
MR. LOCKHART: I have no idea.
Oh, thank you. Next? Want the week ahead?
Q: We do.
MR. LOCKHART: Week ahead. Saturday, October 23rd, the President and the First Lady participate in the Concert of the Century for VH-1's Save the Music on the South Lawn. In-house pool press.
Q: What is that exactly?
MR. LOCKHART: Funny you should ask, I have a paragraph on that. (Laughter.)
VH-1's Save the Music -- we've actually done some things on this. The First Lady's actually participated in several of these events. Let me read this, and if it's still unclear -- ""Save the Music is a national, nonprofit organization dedicated to improving the quality of education in America's public schools by restoring music programs in cities across the country, and by raising public awareness about the importance of music participation for our nation's youth."" This is a pet project of the First Lady; she has participated in the Save the Music events in June '99 and September '98.
Basically, they're going around trying to restore music programs, buying instruments for public schools because, you know, I think we have found in the last 10, 15 years, one of the first casualties in public schools are things like fine arts and music programs. So VH-1 has been very involved in this, and the First Lady has done a couple of events. So this is a big event for them and for the program.
Q: Do you know who's expected here? Aren't there a bunch of musicians and stars?
MR. LOCKHART: There's a lot of them, but I don't have a list of them here. If you turn on VH-1, I think about every 12 minutes they advertise it. I'm afraid to give you the names that I think are here, in case one of them is not here and then it becomes an issue, so we'll get you a list.
Q: Is anybody staying in the White House, Joe?
MR. LOCKHART: I don't know the answer to that. I know there's a lot of people around today because they're, as we now know, doing rehearsals out there. So I think they'll be around for the weekend, in and out. But I don't know that there is anyone actually staying here.
Sunday is an off day. Monday, the President will do an event talking about the importance of prescription drugs in the context of Medicare. He will then travel to New York at 4:00 p.m. to attend a Broadway For Hillary event. He will return to the White House that evening.
Q: Is the White House event the prescription drug event?
MR. LOCKHART: Yes. I don't see a location, but I think it's some place here. Tuesday, the President has no schedule as of now. I will remind you that Tuesday also happens to be the First Lady's birthday.
Wednesday, the President meets with the former Italian Prime Minister and current European Commission President, Romano Prodi. At 3:00 p.m. the President will attend the Congressional Gold Medal Ceremony for former President Ford, on Capitol Hill. He will -- oh, really? I'm not going to tell them this.
Q: Oh, come one.
MR. LOCKHART: That evening at 7:00 p.m., he attends a Bonior reception at the Hay-Adams, Congressman Bonior. Following that, a DNC reception at a private residence.
Thursday, the President will attend an education event which will highlight the Blue Ribbon Schools Commission at the Washington Hilton in the morning and then he has an official working visit with the President of Nigeria. I expect you will have a chance to put some questions to him at that.
Friday, the President will travel to Philadelphia to attend an event for mayoral candidate John Street. Then he will travel to Atlanta to attend a DNC dinner and, later, he will address the Anti-Defamation League which is having their meeting there.
Saturday, the President is down. Sunday evening, the President will depart in the evening for Oslo, Norway.
Q: Will the Clintons be in town together for her birthday?
MR. LOCKHART: I don't know what the First Lady's schedule is. I know that they -- we are returning very late Monday night so, at least for some of the day, but I don't know.
I have, if you are interested, some of the people at this concert.
Q: Oh, boy.
MR. LOCKHART: John Sykes, the head of VH-1, will open it up. Eric Clapton will perform. Eric Clapton and Lenny Kravitz will perform. Sheryl Crowe will perform. B.B. King and Eric Clapton will perform. B.B. King and Melissa Ethridge will perform. Garth Brooks, Gloria Estefan and NSync, John Fogarty, Al Greene, John Mellencamp.
Q: Do we all have tickets? Can you get us in?
MR. LOCKHART: I don't know. Maybe we should stay out here a little while longer.
Q: What's the coverage? I mean, is there --
MR. LOCKHART: In-house pool.
Q: For the whole thing, or for taking out for a bit, or what?
MR. LOCKHART: I think probably taking it for the whole thing, because the remarks are at the beginning and at the end. The First Lady will speak near the beginning of the concert, after Mr. Sykes. And the President will sort of conclude it and thank everybody.
Q: Joe, on this philanthropy conference this afternoon, what is the President's view on the deduction limit for corporations and individuals. Does he think that should be raised?
MR. LOCKHART: I haven't heard the President express any view that it should be raised. But one of the reasons we have these conferences is to hear from people who are involved in the philanthropy business, or whatever the business the conference happens to be on. It's an education process for the President and the First Lady. Again, I haven't seen an outpouring on this subject from the community. But if there are those with that view and we hope they express them today.
Q: Joe, what's the radio address tomorrow -- topic?
MR. LOCKHART: Social Security. I'm sorry, I thought you said when. And I was like, it's always at the same time, 10:06 a.m. (Laughter.)
Q: It's on Sunday.
MR. LOCKHART: Yes, it's Sunday, absolutely. It's Sunday and I look funny in a tie, right. Thank you.

Bill Clinton,"October 28, 1999",The President's News Conference With President Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria,"President Clinton. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Please be seated. President Obasanjo, Mrs. Obasanjo, members of the Nigerian Government, welcome to the White House.
The President has served his country in many ways, including a previous term as President, which was distinguished by his insistence on a peaceful transition to a successor chosen by the people. His recent election marks an even bigger turning point.
Since its birth in 1960, Nigeria's progress has been thwarted over and over again by military leaders with little concern for the 110 million people. For years, its most courageous citizens were jailed or killed; its vast wealth was lost to waste and corruption; its potential to lead its region and the continent toward a better future squandered.
In an early poem, ""Flowers For My Land,"" Nigeria's Nobel laureate, Wole Soyinka, wrote that his beloved country had become a garden of decay. But President Obasanjo's election in May has signaled a new day for Nigeria and new hope for Africa, a fitting capstone to a decade of remarkable democratic revolutions from Poland to South Africa, to the important transition now underway in Indonesia.
It is very much in America's interests that Nigeria succeed, and therefore, we should assist them in their success. We intend to increase our assistance to Nigeria to expand law enforcement cooperation and to work toward an agreement to stimulate trade and investment between us. We intend to do what we can to help Nigeria recover assets plundered by the previous regime.
But we must do more to realize the promise of this moment for Nigeria and for Africa. I want to mention just three issues.
First, we need to recognize that barriers to trade are barriers to opportunity for Africans working hard to catch up to the global economy and for Americans who want to work with them. That's why it is vital that the Senate approve the African growth and opportunity act, which is now pending and on which I spent much of the afternoon working.
A second concrete step we can take, as President Obasanjo has reminded us, is to help relieve the crushing debt burden that is making it so hard for developing nations to get on their feet. It is neither morally right nor economically sound to say that young democracies like Nigeria, as they overcome the painful legacy of dictatorship or misrule, must choose between making interest payments on their debt and investing in the health and education of their children. As Nigeria undertakes its reforms, I will support generous debt rescheduling through the Paris Club and encourage other countries to take further steps.
Finally, we must keep doing our part to bring an end to Africa's remaining conflicts. Many of you have heard about the unspeakable atrocities visited upon the people of Sierra Leone. Nigeria spent billions of dollars leading the international force that ended civil wars there and in Liberia. And for that, the whole world is in its debt.
Now in Sierra Leone as well as in Congo and hopefully soon in Eritrea and Ethiopia, we have a precious opportunity to work with Africans to make peace last. African countries are assuming the largest burden and the greatest risks. All they ask is that we support their efforts, through the United Nations and their own regional organizations. The United States must not let them down.
That is another reason why it is so vital that we honor our obligations and pay our debts to the United Nations. If we fail to give others the tools to share the burdens of leadership in these situations, peace agreements we helped to forge may falter, and America would be left with an unacceptable choice in future conflicts, a choice between doing nothing or acting all alone.
I don't want to leave our children that bleak choice, and I intend to keep working with the Congress to get the resources to recognize our mutual responsibilities with others so that we can prevent it.
President Obasanjo once said, ""I am uncrushed by the past and hopeful of the future. There can be no freedom in fear."" Those succinct words define the essence of democracy and its faith in the capacity of free people to overcome life's obstacles, a universal faith valid no matter where expressed.
Nigeria is a pivot point on which the future of all Africa and much of the world will turn. I am very glad that that country is in the hands of this leader today.
Mr. President, the floor is yours.
President Obasanjo. Mr. President, it is just for me to take this opportunity on behalf of my government and the people of Nigeria to express a deep appreciation for your concern and for your support for the new dispensation in my country for democracy. We thank you for your commitment and the commitment of your country to ensure that democracy will continue to be nurtured and to be sustained in our country and in our part of the world.
We believe that democracy is a process and not an event. And therefore, we must continue to work to expand, to widen, and to deepen the process of democracy, which we are committed to do. We also thank you for the understanding you have shown for the commitment and the sacrifice which our country and our people have made and which we continue to make for peace and stability in our subregion and our region of Africa. We do this knowing and believing that peace is indivisible, and if there is no peace in any part of our subregion, it has implication for us.
We also thank you for the commitment you have made that, while we make our commitment, you will continue to support our commitment, because our own commitment, which will make peace and stability an enduring feature of that part of the world, is a significant contribution to the world of peace, to the world of harmony, to the world of order and stability, which is so dear to all of us and which, of course, is of strategic importance and interest of the United States of America.
We thank you for the fact that you agree with us that in this day and age there should be no part of the world where any section of a society or a community should feel threatened for misgovernance, and we pledge, as we have done before, that whatever needs to be done to ensure humanitarian intervention to save life—dear life—we will join hands with you to ensure it.
Thank you for the reception and the hospitality we have enjoyed here. And we look forward for the opportunity to reciprocate on our land. Thank you.
President Clinton. Thank you.
We will now alternate questions between the American and the Nigerian press members here, and I will call on the American reporters and then the President will call on the Nigerians who have questions. And we'll start with Terry [Terence Hunt, Associated Press]. Go ahead.
Vice President Gore's 2000 Campaign
Q. Thank you, Mr. President. A domestic question. Mr. President, Vice President Gore last night felt compelled to say in New Hampshire, even though no one had asked anything about you, to say, ""I understand the disappointment and anger that you feel toward President Clinton, and I felt it myself."" Did the Vice President express that anger and disappointment to you at any time, and do you think that you have been a drag on the Vice President's campaign and a reminder of the Lewinsky impeachment issue?
President Clinton. No. You know, I think a lot of people who may not like me may hold it against him, but I don't think you hold him responsible. I don't think mature people hold one person responsible for another person's conduct. Do you?
I think if there had been some example of official misconduct in office which he had been a part of, that would be a different thing. But the American people are inherently fair. And insofar as they do blame him, I hope they give him some of the credit for the longest peacetime expansion in history and the lowest unemployment rate in 29 years and the lowest welfare rolls in 30 years and the lowest poverty rates in 20 years and the lowest crime rates in 30 years and the first back-to-back budget surpluses in 42 years and a lot of credit for the smallest Federal Government in 37 years. So I would expect he should get some credit for that, and most Americans kind of like that.
If you ask Americans what kind of changes they want—I've told you before, if somebody polled me in one of these things and said, ""Do you want more of the same, or do you want change,"" I would vote for change. You ask them what kind of changes they want. I bet you they will tell you they want to make better schools; they want more accessible health care; they want us to save Social Security and Medicare; they want America to continue to be safer; they want sensible gun restraint measures. And I think that's what the election will be about.
You know, people are not dumb. They vote for what is in their interest. And sometimes some of your fraternity get them—try to get them confused about what they should be voting on or what they should vote against, but in the end, they almost always get it right, and they vote for what's best for themselves and their children. Otherwise we wouldn't still be here after over 200 years. So that's what I think.
In terms of what he said, he hasn't said anything I hadn't said. He also said some other things that were, I noticed, omitted in the way you characterized the questions. But I was quite pleased with those other things he said. So I think the American people will make a decision based on what's in their interest.
I don't think—by the way, I don't think they ought to vote for him on the fact that we had a great record, either, except that the great record in evidence of what he can do and where he will lead. We get hired to work here. It's a privilege to serve. But if you do have a good record, it is certainly evidence of what you can do and what you will lead. And he has a great record and has been the most accomplished Vice President in history by a good, long ways.
You know, even my adversaries admit that I gave him a kind of partnership and a level of responsibility never before remotely equaled in the history of this country. And I think that is worth something in an election, because it shows what you can do.
But the public will make up their own mind based on what's best for them and their children and not be deterred by other people who would like the election to be about something other than what's best for them and their children.
President Obasanjo. Yes, the Nigerian side.
President Clinton. Otherwise, I don't have an opinion about that. [Laughter]
President Obasanjo. The Nigerian side, your question could be to me or to the President.
Q. I have two questions.
President Obasanjo. You are being greedy. [Laughter]
Q. Thank you.
The two questions: First of all, I want to thank President Clinton for going to Africa and for bringing African issues to the front burner of American policy initiatives. I want to tell you that the 2.5 million Africans in this country, they respect you, and they admire you. Thank you.
President Clinton. Thank you.
Return of Looted Assets/Slavery in Africa
Q. Then I have to ask my question. [Laughter] The first question is, Nigeria has spent a lot of money, President Clinton, in peacekeeping in Sierra Leone and in Liberia. As of yesterday, I believe that is about $8 billion. And at the same time, Nigeria lost a lot of money through of lot of—I mean, our leaders looting the treasury and bringing the money not only to the U.S. but to Switzerland. What is the U.S. going to do about it, to recover that money, the money in this country and the money that is in Switzerland? That is the first question.
And then the next question is for the President of Nigeria, President Obasanjo. As we enter the 21st century, the next millennium, Africans in the Sudan—black Africans are being held slaves. The OAU has not done anything about it. And we would like to know, as the President of the largest African country in Africa, what the Government of Nigeria is going to do to ensure that there is no African who is a slave as we enter the 21st century.
Thank you.
President Clinton. Well, first I'll answer the question you asked me. I think it's important that we do whatever we can to help Nigeria recover money that was looted from the country and that belongs to the people of Nigeria. The Attorney General came to our meeting today, Attorney General Reno, and we are working with the Government of Nigeria, and I will do whatever we can legally do to help recover funds that are in this country and whatever we can do to assist in recovering funds that may be in Switzerland or elsewhere.
You know, we have—we may have to get some help, some voluntary help from the Swiss. You know, the laws are different in different countries, but we think there are quite a number of things we can do here, and we're committed to working with the Nigerian Government to do that.
President Obasanjo. Thank you very much. The only thing I can add to that is that the Swiss authorities have already frozen some accounts in Switzerland, and other steps that have to be taken will be taken as a result of what they have done so far.
The issue of Sudan—I don't think you would be absolutely right to say that the OAU has done nothing about it. Maybe what the OAU has done about it has not achieved the desired result. But let me say this: Over the last 20 years that I was—well, less 3 years and a few months—that I was away in special custody— [laughter]—I have been seized with the Sudan problem.
Personally, I know it very well. I've dealt with all the leaders in the Sudan since I left public office in 1979 until now. And I also know that there are other African leaders who are concerned about the problem, particularly the IGAD leaders; that is the organization in the Horn of Africa. And even right now, they are prescribing solutions; they are suggesting and making recommendations to the two sides.
And our own position, Nigeria's position is that we should not have too many cooks; that will spoil the soup. We shall do everything together. And since IGAD is doing a good job, we should work through them; we should support them. And that is what we are doing. And we believe that that way there will be no diversion; there will be no distraction; and eventually we will get the right solution to the problem of Sudan.
But I agree with you. Anywhere in Africa or, indeed, anywhere in the world, there should be no situation of slavery or slave trade at this time, at this stage, at this point in the last year of the dying years of the 20th century, on the eve of the 21st century.
President Clinton. Lori [Lori Santos, United Press International].
Middle East Peace Process
Q. In Oslo, sir, what are you expecting from your meetings with Chairman Arafat and Prime Minister Barak? And what are the next steps, and are you looking for any concrete results?
President Clinton. Well, first of all, I think it's a good thing that we're going to have this trilateral meeting, and it's just another step along the way. They've been making good progress, and they're working hard.
I wouldn't want to raise expectations excessively about what the results of this meeting will be, but they have put themselves on an aggressive timetable, and they have a lot of tough issues to work through. And since the United States has, at least in my time, primarily played a role as a facilitator, with greater or lesser degrees of intensity and initiative—including the Wye talks, where no one slept for 9 days—I think that it's best for me not to speculate about what the substantive results will be.
Let me say this: I believe that both these leaders want to make peace. I believe they're committed to it. And I believe they know they're down to the difficult issues now. But I also believe they're imagining what a final agreement would look like, what they could live with, and what would be good for the other side, and mostly, what would preserve the integrity of their principles and the long-term peace of the region.
So I'm looking forward to the meeting. I'm looking forward to honoring the memory of Yitzhak Rabin. I think he would be very proud of what Prime Minister Barak and Mr. Arafat are doing now.
President Obasanjo. The Nigerian side?
President Clinton's Commitments to Nigeria
Q. Mr. President, in your statement here you were full of thanks to President Clinton for the support he has expressed to you, probably, during discussions today. Would you give us some of the specific commitment that he made to you during your discussions?
President Obasanjo. Well, the same specific commitment he made to me during our discussion, he has made here. He will support efforts to have resources taken away illegally from Nigeria, to recover them. He will support our efforts to lift the burden of debt, so that we can have a breather to be able to consolidate our democracy. He will support our efforts to be able to be strong enough internally, as a country, and within our subregion and our region, so that we can contribute to peace and stability in our region and in our subregion. He will support efforts to deal with crime, to fight against crime and narcotic traffic in our country.
Those are some of them, and I think for those commitments he deserves to be thanked. I don't know what you think.
President Clinton. Can I just say, also—I don't believe you said this exactly, Mr. President. I did make it clear that we have requested from the Congress funds sufficient to increase our bilateral aid to Nigeria, somewhere between 3 and 4 times what it was before. And that's part of—and I vetoed the first bill that the Congress passed, and we're fighting now to try to get more funds in the aggregate for our foreign assistance programs. And this is one of the reasons that I want the money. And I believe that—I may be wrong, but I believe that both Republicans and Democrats in the United States Congress understand that Nigeria's future is very important to our own.
Arshad [Arshad Mohammed, Reuters].
Situation in Chechnya
Q. Mr. President, Russia appears to have intensified its offensive against Chechnya this week with heavy bombardment and with ground troops approaching the capital, Grozny, from three directions. Do you think that this offensive may ultimately backfire on Russia and lead to greater bitterness among the Chechens toward Moscow and, ultimately, sow deeper seeds of conflict both in the region and also possibly that may bring itself back to Russian soil?
President Clinton. I think it depends upon whether, ultimately, there is a political solution or not or whether the Russian Government attempts to find a military solution. I have never believed that, ultimately, there could be a solution to any of these problems that was not a political one, that recognized the extraordinary, complex tapestry of ethnic and religious groups across the belly of Russia and just to the south.
As you know, it's an explosive part of the world. Not just in Chechnya, but we've had difficulties in Dagestan; the Georgians have had their challenges; we had the terrible, terrible shooting in Armenia yesterday and the loss of the Prime Minister and seven others.
So, you know, it has been our experience— that's all I can tell you—it's been our experience that in every place where there are genuine ethnic and religious difficulties and particularly when they're combined, that sooner or later people have to stop fighting and start talking and that any military strategy ought to be designed to do nothing more than to create the conditions within which a negotiated settlement can be reached, because in the end I think that's what will have to happen.
And what the United States hopes, since we also have a big stake in the success of democracy and freedom and prosperity in Russia, is that we will see a minimization of the casualties and that we will hasten the day when there will be a negotiated solution that all the parties can live with.
Inducement To Invest in Nigeria
Q. Mr. President, you have the largest democracy in Africa. What are the initiatives you have to make it sustainable over some time? Also as far as debt consolidation is concerned, what are some of the measures your Government is doing to attract businesses and investors to invest in Nigeria?
President Obasanjo. Well, to invite investment into Nigeria, we have to create conducive environment for business to thrive. We have to create conducive environment for investors to want to invest in Nigeria because investors have choices. Therefore, we should make them choose to come to Nigeria.
And what are we doing? First of all, we are eliminating corruption as a way of life in Nigeria. Few—not many if at all any honest businessmen will want to rush into a corrupt atmosphere to do business. So we have to remove corruption, and we are doing that. We have to provide a level playing ground for all participants, so that there is equity, there is fairness, there is justice, and you can go in and compete. That we have done. The rules and regulations must be clear, so that you know what it is. There must be transparency. There must be openness. That, too, we have done, particularly in competition, so that when you do lose out, you are at least satisfied that the one who gets it is a better hand or has presented a better case or a better offer.
Again, we have to provide an environment that is reasonably—reasonably—devoid of crime. We are fighting against crime—crime—in such a way that lives and properties can be safe and secure, in such a way that investment can be secure. These and all the things we are doing— the rule of law, so that when you have to seek arbitration by the court, you can be sure that you get a fair deal from the court—we are doing all that we need to do to make the investors feel that all of the things put together, Nigeria is a better place to invest than any other place of comparative economic situation.
President Clinton. If I could just say, if I were in the audience, I would be applauding what the President said because, you know, I've spent a great deal of my time for 7 years trying to create economic opportunities for the American people and even trying to create special incentives for people to go to some of the poorest areas in our country, in our empowerment zone program that the Vice President has run for 6 years now. And everything he said is right. Nigeria is a great country. You have a large population, vast resources, good location, all that oil. You have to be well-governed and competitive.
What he said was absolutely right. I can just tell you as an outsider, Nigeria will be a very appealing place to people all over the world if they are convinced it is well-governed and serious about development. And in the end, the President—he's also a good salesman. He's out here working some of those opportunities while he's here in America, and I've been impressed.
John [John Palmer, NBC News], go ahead.
Enforcement of Gun Laws
Q. Mr. President, I have a domestic question. I don't know how much of an opportunity you have these days to listen to the radio. But the National Rifle Association is conducting quite a campaign, saying that we really don't need any new gun laws, if your administration would just enforce those that are on the books. How has your administration done in enforcing these laws, and how do you answer that rather serious charge?
President Clinton. Let me just say what they do. What they do is, they say, our prosecution for gun law violations, our volume is down. What they don't do is to look at the total prosecutions for gun law violations, the volume of which is up. The number of total gun law violations is up.
Now, what we have done, ever since Attorney General Reno came to the Justice Department, as a local prosecutor in a big urban prosecutorial district in Miami, we have worked to properly allocate the resources of the Justice Department and local prosecutors. And we have worked with all of our U.S. attorneys to do the same thing. So it's just not accurate to say, if you look at total prosecutions of existing laws, that they're down. That's the first thing I want to say.
Second thing I want to say is, the average sentence in America, I believe, is longer than it is in any other country in the world, except one, maybe. And the percentage of people we have behind bars is higher, I believe, than any other country in the world. There are two possible exceptions. We might be as low as third, but I think we're first.
Now, the last thing I want to say about that is, they made this argument before. This is the argument they made against the Brady bill. Remember, they said two things: All you've got to do is really prosecute the existing laws; and the Brady bill won't do any good because criminals don't buy their guns at gun stores. Those were the two arguments they made.
Well, 5 years later we've got 400,000 people who haven't been able to buy guns because of the Brady bill, and we've got the lowest crime rate in 30 years. And you know, we've been all for enforcement. I'm trying to get more prosecutors right now. We've put 100,000 police on the street, I would remind you. I'm not against enforcement. But that is not an excuse for America to keep being the only major country in the world that still has gaping loopholes in its protections to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and children.
And let me just say one thing. I know I've said this till a lot of you are sick of me saying this, but I'm going to say it until I leave here and after I'm gone. If their arguments were right, we would not have the kind of accidental death rate by guns that we do. The accidental death rate by gunshots of children in the United States is 9 times higher than the rate of the next 25 largest industrial economies put together.
We have not done enough to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and children. We can do more without interfering with the right to hunt and the right to sport shoot. And they're just wrong. It sounds clever. You know, it's interesting, the NRA, they're normally with the conservatives; they like it when you have States' rights, you know. So here we worked out a deal, and the local prosecutors do more cases which ought to be in the local courts, and we take the hard cases and put them in the Federal courts that take more time, more cost, or multi-State cases, and they conveniently take the Federal number and overlook the rest.
And I might say, I think in times past, maybe administrations that did not want to enforce— did not want to pass the Brady bill, did not want to have the assault weapons ban, did not want to close the loopholes in the background checks, might have gone out and filed a lot of cases to say, ""Well, this is what we're doing."" The evidence is in. We have the lowest crime rate in 30 years, and the assault weapons ban and the Brady bill played a big role in it.
So the NRA is fighting a rearguard action that's just wrong. They were wrong on the Brady bill, and they're wrong today. You don't have to take my word for it. Look at the evidence and ask yourself why, if you can enforce your way out of this, every other country in the world with an advanced economy still has a lower murder rate and a drastically lower rate of accidental killings by guns? You know, they never talk about that, because they can't.
Debt Relief for Nigeria
Q. My question is for either of the two Presidents. Specifically, with all emphasis on that word, the debt relief that has been proposed for Nigeria, is it consolation, partial or total, or rescheduling?
President Obasanjo. Well, let me put it this way: The best thing that I would want to have is not to have debt at all. But when you look at it, since 1985 or thereabout, when the total debt we had was about $6 billion, we really haven't added much debt to it. And our debt stands at about $28-$30 billion today. And all that is essentially interest rescheduling and all that.
So when you talk about rescheduling, I'm apprehensive. When you talk of remission, even staying of interest for some time will be one way. But we cannot—we cannot—talk of being able to do what we need to do to nurture, to sustain democracy, and to give our people democracy dividend, bearing the burden of debt that is hanging over us at this point in time.
President Clinton. Let me answer the question, and I will try to be—I'll be very candid with you. First of all, you must understand this is not a question for the United States only to resolve. I have a much more aggressive attitude, generally, on debt relief than many of my counterparts do in other parts of the world, although not all of them. There are others who agree with me. And I have a more aggressive attitude than some people in our Congress do, although I hope I can persuade them before we go home this year.
Under the present framework, Nigeria is not eligible for total cancellation of debt because of its assets, its petroleum assets. As the President pointed out to me today, if you had a different measure, if you measured the real per capita income of individual Nigerians or some of the other social indicators like infant mortality, it would present, I think, a more accurate picture of what life in Nigeria is like today.
Here is my view. Right now, we ought to get whatever relief we can, because you need to—even the rescheduling relief is worth something. It takes a burden off your back now and gives you a chance to get some breathing room and doesn't raise the questions of creditworthiness, so that we can get more investment into Nigeria and more loans into Nigeria as well, if they're necessary.
Then I think, frankly, that the more the President succeeds in the program that he's outlined, the more we will be able to work with the rest of the world to deal with the long-term interests of Nigeria and the long-term health of Nigeria. But the reason I said rescheduling today is I have concluded that that's really worth something to you, and that's all we can do right now, because of the standard by which the highly indebted poor countries are measured.
But if you look at what's happened to Nigeria's oil resources and what's happened in the previous years and what people are really living on, you could make a compelling case for more relief. And I think what we should do is take what we can get now and pocket it and try to get some more investment into your country and keep working to support the reforms that the President has outlined and just keep working to get more relief as we go along. That's what I think is the only realistic hope. And I am certainly open to that. And I think the more other world leaders get to see this President, get to see what's going on, the more likely we'll be to succeed.
We'll take one more each. Yes, go ahead. I didn't know who I pointed at—[laughter]— all three of you should stand up and shout. Give me a selection. I'll decide which one I want to answer. [Laughter]
Q. We could do it in unison.
President Clinton. All right, go ahead.
Federal Budget
Q. Mr. President, it's late in the congressional budget process, and I'm wondering, is there any prospect at this point of a Government shutdown, and are there any of your priorities on which you will insist on be non-negotiable in the talks that are occurring right now?
President Clinton. I do not believe there will be a Government shutdown. I would be very surprised if there is one. But neither do I think we should just have continuing resolutions for the next year and a half. Somehow we have to come to terms with this.
Just today—I don't know if you saw it—the Congressional Budget Office said that the budget passed by the Republican majority is, even with the one percent across-the-board budget cut which you've already heard the Secretary of Defense and others say would have a very bad impacts, is still $17 billion short and would require more than 4 percent more to be cut across the board, just as I told them all along.
So we're going to have to work together to get a budget that works. And all this sort of smoke and mirrors that they have been doing and claiming that we and the Democrats were trying to spend the Social Security surplus, when they were spending it all along, is not helpful.
Most Americans, as a matter of fact—and this is a service all of you could do for the country, actually. I just spoke to a bunch of educators today, and they all came up afterward and thanked me for explaining what was really going on, because most Americans can't figure out why, if we keep announcing bigger and bigger surpluses, why we're having a budget fight, and why we're having across-the-board cuts.
And of course, it's because both parties made a commitment at the beginning of this session that from this day forward we wouldn't spend the Social Security surplus, which could have been done without tough choices had it not been for the magnitude of the natural disasters and the farm crisis and the size of the defense increases that the Congress wanted, even over and above the substantial defense increases that I recommended.
So that's why we've got this problem. We can solve this problem. I am committed to doing it. But I think it would be a great mistake for us to walk away from here and abandon the commitment we made just last year to 100,000 teachers. We ought to get the 50,000 police started, just like we started the 100,000 police before, because it gave us the lowest crime rate in 30 years, and now we can look forward to being the safest big country in the world. And we need to adequately fund our environmental budget and get those riders out of there, those antienvironmental riders out of there.
I never though I'd get 100 percent of what I wanted. I think they're making a big mistake not beginning the prescription drug benefit on Medicare and not adding any days to the life of the Medicare or the Social Security Trust Fund. But because I vetoed the tax cut, we can come back to all that early next year. But we shouldn't walk away from here having dismantled our commitment to 100,000 teachers, not dealing with the 50,000 police, not dealing with the environmental issues. And I'm prepared to work with them.
I don't want a partisan fight on this. This is crazy for us to be having a big partisan blowout because they both made a commitment not to spend the Social Security surplus, and then it turned out to be harder than necessary, and all of it is being mixed into a sort of a combustible political mix. We need to sit down like grownups, go out and tell the American people the truth, and work through this. We can find the offsets. We don't have to spend the Social Security surplus. We can do this. And I hope they will work with me to do it.
Demographics in Nigeria
Q. According to a recent United Nations world population prospect report, 45 percent of Nigeria's 1.29 million population is under age 15, and an additional 18 is in the 15 to 24 years category. What this means is that we have about 63 percent of Nigeria's population which is under the age of 24. President Obasanjo, what does this mean to today's Nigeria and the country's future?
President Obasanjo. Well, to today's Nigeria it means that—simple—37 percent—if you take all the remainder as working, which is not the case—that 37 percent of Nigerians are working to keep 100 percent of Nigerians alive, because you know it, from age one to about age 24, you are preparing yourself for life. It's either you are in school, or you are learning a trade, or you are in the university or something of that nature. Now, that puts strain on Nigerians that are working if they are working. But are they really working? That's another question.
Then, for future, if we are able to train them, ah, the future is bright. There you will have that large population, if everything else is all right, that will be vibrant, educated, talented, and going places for Nigeria, well-governed, the economy buoyant. You can't ask for anything better. So if we train, we look after them and we prepare them adequately, good for future. But for now, it's a strain, and we have to bear out this strain.

Bill Clinton,"November 01, 1999",Remarks Following Discussions With Prime Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik of Norway and an Exchange With Reporters in Oslo,"Prime Minister Bondevik. Mr. President, dear journalists, it's a very special occasion for us in Norway. This is the very first visit from a sitting President of the United States to our country. So we are so glad to receive President Clinton here.
We have had fruitful discussions, where we could continue our talks from the White House in Washington, only 2 weeks ago. And of course, we have discussed the Middle East peace process. We think that the ceremonial commemoration tomorrow for the late Prime Minister Rabin and the talks in that framework can stimulate the peace process. And we are both committed to assist the two parties. The main responsibility for a final solution is, of course, upon the two parties.
Norway and the U.S. will seek ways to expand our common efforts in a number of areas for security, development, and for well-being. The President and I have today agreed on an initiative to follow up the Reykjavik Conference on Women and Democracy, where the First Lady, Hillary Clinton, participated. We are also agreed on a joint initiative on funding for support of disabled victims of the war in Sierra Leone.
Mr. President, I believe that you want to say a few words before we answer one or two questions. Mr. President.
President Clinton. Thank you. First, Prime Minister, let me say I am delighted to be here, honored by your invitation to come a few weeks ago, and then by the King's invitation to come to Norway. As you perhaps know, I traveled here alone as a young man some 30 years ago— it was actually 30 years ago this December— and I fell in love with this country. I'd long wanted to come back. I was amazed to discover that I am the first sitting President ever to visit Norway. I can't imagine what the others were thinking about—[laughter]—but I am delighted to be here.
I also would like to thank you for the wonderful reception that my wife and my daughter received when they represented our Nation in Lillehammer at the Olympics, and for the support, Prime Minister, you have given to the women's conference and the women's issues that Hillary has tried to raise, most recently in Reykjavik with representatives of your country and the other countries in the region.
We have been friends for a long time. We have been allies for 50 years with NATO. Today the Prime Minister and I discussed building a Europe that is united, democratic, and free; and I am looking forward to seeing the Prime Minister again shortly in Turkey at the meeting of the OSCE. And I'm very grateful that Norway is now the leader of the OSCE, serving its term as chair.
We did discuss the Sierra Leone, and I would just like to say again, I am profoundly grateful that Norway has agreed to work with the United States to provide prosthetics, to provide artificial limbs to as many people as we possibly can, many of them children, whose limbs were deliberately amputated in the cruel civil war in Sierra Leone.
I also want to thank you, Prime Minister, for Norway's support for our common efforts to end the ethnic cleansing in Kosovo. And I want to say a special word of thanks to the Norwegian people, because I believe that when the 800,000-plus Kosovar Albanians were driven from their home, on a per capita basis, Norway took in more of the refugees from Kosovo than any other country in the world. And that is something that you can be very proud of and something for which your friends must be very grateful. So I want to thank you for that.
And finally, let me thank you for your continuing interest in the Middle East peace process and for having this wonderful occasion to honor the memory of my friend and partner, former Prime Minister Rabin. I think it will be very successful, indeed. Your country has a lot to be proud of. You have enormous influence for your size, and it is very much earned and deserved. Thank you.
Middle East Peace Process
Q. Mr. President, do you believe that the Middle East talks here in Oslo can move the peace process substantially forward?
President Clinton. Yes, I do. I don't think you should expect some sort of major announced breakthrough here, because, keep in mind, the parties have had—since, in the last couple of years, they had the Wye peace agreement under Prime Minister Netanyahu and Chairman Arafat. Then when Prime Minister Barak came in, they modified the Wye peace agreement and agreed to an even faster schedule of implementation.
Since then, Israel has released controversial political prisoners, agreed to establish safe passage between—and started it, actually, started the safe passage between the West Bank and Gaza, and agreed to open a port, which was a source of great tension between them before. Now they have to move into the final status talks, as conceived almost 7 years ago now here in Oslo, with the Oslo accords. So the important thing now is that the two leaders know that they have set themselves an ambitious timetable and that they agreed about how they're going to meet the timetable. This is the hard part, I mean the really hard part. And we all need to support them.
But do I believe that we can come out of this meeting and this solemn occasion with a renewed commitment to the peace process? Yes, I do.
EgyptAir Flight 990 Aircraft Tragedy
Q. Mr. President, they're still combing the wreckage of EgyptAir flight 990. Do you know any more about the cause of the tragedy, whether it was a mechanical malfunction or has terrorism been ruled out? And have there been any threats recently against any carriers flying out of the United States?
President Clinton. We know nothing more than I said to you earlier today—it seems like half a lifetime ago—when I came out of church with Hillary. We are still searching. We have to find—as you know, to make a final determination about the cause of the crash will require the recovery of as much of the airplane as possible, as well as the equipment, which will give us some—if the usual case is present here, give us a pretty definitive idea of what happened.
But that has not been done yet, and therefore, I will say again, nothing has been ruled in, nothing has been ruled out. And I hope no one will draw any conclusions one way or the other until we finish the work.
President's Legacy
Q. Mr. President, how do you hope that people will remember you as the President of the United States? And is the peace process in the Middle East important in that regard? Would you like to be remembered as the President that created peace in the Middle East?
President Clinton. Well, first of all, that's a question I'd feel more comfortable answering if I weren't President anymore, because I hope I'm still piling up memories for them. But I can tell you what I tried to do.
What I tried to do is, first of all, take a country which I've found in economic distress and social division and turn it around toward greater prosperity and greater harmony, and convince people that, working together, we could solve our social problems. And then, I hope I will be remembered as someone who got our country to assume its responsibilities in the post-cold-war world, to make America a major force for peace and freedom, and against terrorism and racial and ethnic and religious hatreds. That is what I have worked to do and what I intend to continue working to do every day I have left to serve.
Threats to U.S. Air Carriers/Middle East Peace Process
Q. Mr. President, two things. Could you address Mr. Katz' question about whether there had been any threats to U.S.—to carriers, airline carriers flying out of the United States? And also, do you see any merit to the idea that's been floated about having a Camp David-style negotiation in January to help Israel and the Palestinians meet the rigorous deadlines that they've set for themselves on the toughest issues in the talks?
President Clinton. First, Terry [Terence Hunt, Associated Press], on the first question you ask—and I didn't mean to evade it—if there have been any such threats, I do not know about them. That is, I am not aware of any specific threats against American airlines or airplanes flying out of American airports with large numbers of American passengers. If there have been any such, I don't know about them.
Now, it is possible that there could have been some that I don't know about, so I don't want to—I can't tell you the things I don't know about didn't happen. But I can tell you that I'm not aware of any, and as you know, I work on my intelligence information every day.
As to the possibility of a Camp David-style meeting, I think it is premature to discuss that at this time. What we need now is an understanding of the parameters of where we're going and how we're going to get there. I wouldn't rule out anything, but there is, as you know, going all the way back to '93, there is nothing I would not do if I thought it would genuinely help to build a lasting peace in the Middle East. There is nothing I would not do, and I'm prepared to reaffirm that to Prime Minister Barak and to Chairman Arafat.
But one of the things we have also learned here is that, in the end, the hard decisions have to be made by the parties. The United States can help with financial support, with military support, with moral backup. The rest of the world can help in many ways. But we have to get a framework of going forward that is consistent with the timetable they, themselves, have adopted, because I don't think we want to slip the timetable. Even though these decisions are very hard, they've been looming out there for several years now, and they're not going to get any easier, in my judgment, by letting them linger. So I will do what I can to get this thing going.
Prime Minister Bondevik. Last question.
Q. Yes, Mr. President, what do you regard as a real progress in the discussions with you and the Palestinians and the Israelis concerning the discussions about peace in Palestine and Israel?
President Clinton. The real problems?
Q. The real progress. What will you regard as the real progress?
President Clinton. Oh, I'm sorry. Well, I would feel that real progress has been made if they made agreements about the modalities under which they will proceed—the procedures, the process, how it's going to operate—so that we can move into and then through these decisions in a timely fashion.
There's no way in the world they can come here and agree in talks with me on the big issues. You know what all the big issues are. That's why they're final status issues. But if we can get everybody sort of focused on what it would take to get there within the time allotted, the time they have allotted themselves, then I think that that would be a very good thing, indeed.
Keep in mind, you have here leaders who have demonstrated their commitment to peace and demonstrated their willingness to take risks. And you also have leaders who have been supported by their people for taking those risks. So I don't think this is a time for handwringing. But when you have a lot of implementation, like you did recently with the Wye modified agreement, and then you have the prisoners release, you have the port decision going forward, you have the safe passage open, you have some settlements closed and not all settlements closed, what it does is it whets everyone's appetite, on the one hand, for more to be done; and it also builds in a little bit of a resistance to more being done. It's like, ""I'm tired; I did this last week,"" you know? And what we've got to do is to create a renewed energy to make the process continuous, until you work all the way through to the end.
Prime Minister Bondevik. I'm sorry, I just have to end up by saying that I know that you have been informed that I could be to your disposal after the President has left this building. Unfortunately, because we are on overtime for the luncheon at the Royal Castle, I also have to leave now. But I can be to your disposal at the Grand Hotel at 2:15, approximately, and tell you even more about our discussions.
We have, of course, also discussed the situation in Chechnya, our relations to Russia. We have found that we have very much in common regarding the priorities in foreign policy, combating poverty, promoting human rights, preventing conflicts. And I feel that our meeting has served to strengthen the already close ties between our two nations.
Thank you so much.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-following-discussions-with-prime-minister-kjell-magne-bondevik-norway-and-exchange
Bill Clinton,"November 01, 1999",Press Briefing by Joe Lockhart,"Radisson Plaza Hotel
Oslo, Norway
7:45 P.M. (L)
MR. LOCKHART: Okay, any questions on any other subjects? Yes?
Q: Joe, do you know anything more on what the administration knows about the cause into the crash of Egyptair?
MR. LOCKHART: I don't have any more specific information than what the President reported to you all earlier today. I think for those of you who had the ability to watch the press briefing from Admiral Larabie, I think he brought -- the press corps gathered where he is up to date on what the Coast Guard, in conjunction with the Navy, is doing as far as moving to a search and recover operation.
I think the NTSB will be in a position to do a briefing in the next couple of hours as far as what they have learned. But we are still in a situation here where the President's words from this morning are quite up to date as far as not understanding at this point the cause of the crash.
Q: Does uncertainty about the cause of the crash have any effect on the talks here?
MR. LOCKHART: I don't think so. I think that the President made clear yesterday when asked that same question before departing that it should have no impact, and I don't believe there has been any sense that anything but the issues at hand have been discussed here in the context of remembering the slain Prime Minister Rabin.
Q: Joe, the airline has confirmed now that there were 106 Americans on board the aircraft. Given that new information, is the President planning on making any statement of condolence to the families?
MR. LOCKHART: I think the President spoke directly yesterday that -- both to the American citizens that were on board that and the citizens of other countries. He did it directly when he spoke to President Mubarak, that our thoughts and prayers as a nation are with these families, the families of the victims, those who have been impacted by this tragedy. And we are working very hard, I think, as Admiral Larabie indicated, as the NTSB has indicated, to work with the families to provide them with up to date and accurate information, and that is something that I think you all know is a very high priority for the President and for everyone in the administration.
We've worked very hard at improving the system of dealing with the families and getting them the best and most up to date information.
Q: Joe, has any additional security measures or any additional precautions been taken here because of the plane crash?
MR. LOCKHART: I think, as you know, it's our longstanding practice not to comment on security issues involving the President, so I will comply with our longstanding practice.
Q: Can you explain to me what Clinton time is, that he's always arriving so late? (Laughter.)
MR. LOCKHART: Can we go back on background? The President had a very full schedule, as you know. He flew through the night to come here. We had a full schedule for the day. I think we -- the meetings, the bilateral, the meetings this evening, ran a little bit long. Given the spirit in which these meetings have been put together, as far as commemorating the Oslo Accords, Prime Minister Rabin, it is certainly worth the extra time as we work through the many issues that can take us to a final status agreement.
Q: Joe, why was the President ten minutes late this morning?
MR. LOCKHART: Why was the President ten minutes late?
Q: For King Harald.
MR. LOCKHART: Because the car getting to the palace was ten minutes behind schedule.
Q: But what caused his car to be ten minutes behind schedule?
MR. LOCKHART: Because he got into the car, here at the hotel, ten minutes later than the schedule indicated.
Q: How was it that he got into the car 10 minutes late?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, he left the suite ten minutes beyond where the schedule told him to leave, to go down -- (laughter.)
Q: Wait a minute. Can I roll back further to the airport? It took him about ten minutes to come down. Was there a reason? Was he making some sort of a phone call?
MR. LOCKHART: No. He was getting changed.
Q: Okay, sorry.
Q: Joe, another softball question. (Laughter.) Is there a reaction to Louis Freeh's letter to Ken Starr, in which he praised Ken Starr lavishly?
MR. LOCKHART: I think those are probably two subjects that I'm best advised to say nothing about, so I'll say nothing about.
Q: Joe, how concerned is the President about developments in Chechnya?
MR. LOCKHART: I think the President is quite concerned about the escalating violence. We've made quite clear at all levels of the government, most recently the President's National Security Advisor, Sandy Berger, talking to the Prime Minister about the escalating violence, particularly some of the indiscriminate use of force on innocent civilians, the refugee problems. So I expect the President will take the opportunity tomorrow to express that concern directly to Prime Minister Putin, as well as a number of other issues.
Q: Maybe you could elaborate a little bit on what the background briefer said. As you probably know, Arafat and Barak live about ten miles apart, but they have to come here to talk. Can you give us just a better sense of what role Clinton is actually likely to play, not just now but in the months ahead?
MR. LOCKHART: I will leave the particulars to what the background briefer, who just left here, said. I mean, the President has always said that the United States stands ready to play whatever useful role it can in this process -- as a facilitator, as an honest broker -- and will continue to do that as appropriate.
Q: Joe, back on Chechnya for a second.
Q: Was this whole meeting the Norwegians' idea? Or did we say to the Norwegians, did the United States say to the Norwegians, wouldn't it be a good idea to have us all back to Oslo, to kind of jumpstart this process?
MR. LOCKHART: No, my understanding is that the idea was generated from here. They invited us sometime ago and we made the decision that this was a useful forum and a productive way for the President to engage in this process.
Q: Joe, back on Chechnya for a second, when was the call between Berger and Putin? Was that recent, or was that --
MR. LOCKHART: I believe that was the 30th, which was Saturday. Saturday, thanks.
In the back.
Q: Joe, you said that the President would take the opportunity tomorrow to express his concern to the Russian Prime Minister. Are there any concrete steps that the administration is considering to get their message across to the Russians?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, the President will make clear in the meeting tomorrow, as has been done by others in our government, that we are very concerned about the escalation of violence. We believe that it poses an increasing threat to the region and the stability of the region; and that we very much don't want to see a repeat of what happened in 1994-1995, where a military solution was -- there was an attempt to impose a military solution.
We will make clear that we believe strongly that the Russians need to engage in a political dialogue, be proactive in that effort, as a way of finding a political solution.
Q: You know, the Secretary of State, several times -- Mr. Berger, Strobe in Moscow -- you know, they say -- at least the Secretary does, straightforward, that they're not taking my advice, they're not taking the U.S. advice. Where do you go with this?
MR. LOCKHART: I don't want to prejudge what comes out of tomorrow's meeting. I think the President looks forward to the meeting; he will make his points directly to the Russian Prime Minister, acknowledging the serious concern that we have.
Q: On that same point, do you consider the bombing of that refugee column, where five Red Cross vehicles, plainly marked, were hit and the killing of people in the process? Was that a war crime under international law?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, that is obviously something that I cannot determine. That is something that investigators will have to look at. I think it does serve, though, as an example of the concern we have over the escalating violence and the indiscriminate use of force against civilians.
Q: Just to follow up Chechnya. Is the U.S. not concerned that the CFE treaty has actually breached now several times by the number of troops that the Russians have actually put into Chechnya? This is a CFE treaty which has been long negotiated and worked hard for.
MR. LOCKHART: And that work is continuing and I expect the CFE treaty, the adaption of the CFE treaty and the compliance, or noncompliance, to be a subject of discussion. The Russians have been quite transparent in the fact that they have not come under the limits, due to the situation in the Caucuses.
We have been working with them. I expect this to be part of the discussion tomorrow. I expect it to continue as we move forward. I think many of you saw the Prime Minister's statement today, talking about their intention to come under these limits and that the situation that's in place now, they view as a temporary one. But we expect to address that directly tomorrow.
Q: Couldn't this be -- induced by other states, if they can breach the ceilings and then go back under or go back over?
MR. LOCKHART: Listen, I think that we've worked long and hard on the CFE agreement. They have been quite transparent in what they say is the temporary inability to come under the limits. We'll talk to them about that directly tomorrow.
Q: Joe, might he say an extra day if he finds -- again, on the Middle East -- if he finds his meeting, his trilateral and other meetings --
MR. LOCKHART: I don't want to artificially rule anything out, but I expect we'll stay to our schedule.
Q: Joe, how do you see the current situation in Chechnya? Do you agree with the President and the Prime Minister that this is an anti-terrorist operation, or do you see this as a return to the repressive Soviet tactics of the past era?
MR. LOCKHART: I think we certainly recognize Russia's sovereignty here, but we've expressed at many levels of our government increasing concern over the escalating violence and have made it very clear that a military solution cannot work here and that there has to be a political dialogue. And I think the message the President will send directly tomorrow is that the Russians should be proactive in engaging in that political dialogue.
Q: Joe, what are your latest hopes on getting the money for, you know, the Wye Accord? Are you getting anything back from Washington on the budget?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, I think most of what the House and Senate have been working on in the last couple days is the labor, education and health care appropriations bill. There have been some discussions. We've made it very clear with the Republican leadership, their appropriators, that this is a commitment that has to be met and we're going to continue working with them until we get to a point where we can meet our commitments.
Q: Which will be the other issues in the meeting between the President and Mr. Putin? And do you expect the Russians to take a more involved role in the peace process in the Middle East?
MR. LOCKHART: I think that, in addition to Chechnya and the CFE discussions, the President will also take the opportunity to deal with some of the arms control and nonproliferation issues that come up when we talk directly with the Russians -- particularly the START II, START III discussion, the ABM treaty in the context of the national missile defense work that's going on in the United States.
Q: Joe, did the President and First Lady go to closing on their house today?
MR. LOCKHART: My understanding is that will be done by close of business East Coast time today. When it is complete, Mr. Kennedy will put out some word that it is done so that everybody knows that.
Q: How long did each meeting last, and is there any specific reason why they went on longer than scheduled?
MR. LOCKHART: No, I think -- I don't have a precise time, because I came down here on the meeting with Chairman Arafat. But I think the meeting with Prime Minister Barak went just over an hour. So it wasn't significantly longer than scheduled. But we ended up putting the two together, being a little bit behind our schedule.
Q: Why did he especially want the meetings to be one-on-one without any aides there?
MR. LOCKHART: I think the President looks forward to the opportunity to speak directly. I think he wanted this to be a productive session and made the judgment that it was best to move forward on a one-on-one basis so he could really get a chance to talk directly and openly with the two leaders. They will meet, as you know, together later tonight, and then the three parties will get together tomorrow.
Q: Will it just be the three of them tomorrow, or will it be with aides?
MR. LOCKHART: I don't know what the arrangements for that are. I can check.
Q: Joe, we keep hearing, as Barry, I think, pointed out that Russia should listen to the United States' warnings on Chechnya not to repeat the disasters of 1994 and 1996, not to take these actions on civilians. What will happen to Russia, what can the United States do if Russia continues to fail to heed those warnings?
MR. LOCKHART: I'm not going to get into speculating from here on what steps may or may not be available. I can tell you that the President looks forward to his meeting tomorrow when we'll make the points that I've outlined here directly to the Prime Minister.
Q: Do speculations that Mr. Putin might be the next president of Russia have an influence on the meeting tomorrow with the President?
MR. LOCKHART: No, I don't think the internal political situation as far as the electoral politics of Russia will be a factor in tomorrow's meeting.
Q: Do you know how it came about that Barak and Arafat decided to have their one-on-one meeting tonight, how that originated? Because it wasn't in the schedule.
MR. LOCKHART: I don't. I know that it was reported in probably the middle of the afternoon here, but I would suggest that you go to the two parties to try to find out the origin of that.
Q: Could you elaborate a bit more on the kind of channels Washington may be having with Damascus?
MR. LOCKHART: No, I think I'll leave it to what the previous briefer said or did not say on that subject.
Q: I know you're sick of legacy questions, but this is an issue that the President has dealt with throughout his presidency. The Oslo Accords came out the first year of his presidency, and I wonder if you could talk in some way about how important it is to him to conclude it also during his term in office?
MR. LOCKHART: I think the President, as well as the team that's worked so hard on this, has an interest in seeing a positive outcome here of seeing a long-lasting peace agreement reached. I don't think that the President is focused on the calendar in the way that the question suggests. It was the parties who set an aggressive schedule based on their interests in trying to find an agreement, and the President wants to be helpful in this process in any way he can. But it's ultimately up to the parties to reach -- to bridge the differences, to make the tough decisions, and they have moved forward with an aggressive schedule, and it's based on their interests rather than any other outside interests.
Q: Joe, I don't know if you had a chance to notice, but despite all that's going on in Chechnya, border openings were opened for refugees to pass through. I wonder what you think of that, but is that something the President might try to build on tomorrow?
MR. LOCKHART: I hadn't seen that report, but we have been quite concerned, have made the point that there were a number of refugees being sort of held in a no man's land situation somewhere near 200,000. So I think it's important that people are given free access. That's a point we've made, and to the extent that that's being done, that is something that is positive.
Thanks, everyone.
THE PRESS: Thank you.

Bill Clinton,"November 08, 1999",Remarks at Georgetown University,"Thank you very much, Secretary Albright, for your introduction and your leadership. From the reception you just received, I would say you can come home at any time. But I hope you'll wait a while longer.
Thank you, Father O'Donovan, for welcoming me back to Georgetown. Dean Gallucci, thank you. Mrs. Quandt, thank you so much for this lecture. And to the representatives of BMW, members of the diplomatic community, the many distinguished citizens who are here, and to Mr. Billington, Mrs. Graham, and others, and to all the young students who are here. In many ways, this day is especially for you.
I too want to say a special word of thanks to Prime Minister Zeman of the Czech Republic and Prime Minister Dzurinda of Slovakia. They have come a long way to be with us today. They have come a long way with their people in the last decade, from dictatorship to democracy, from command and control to market economies, from isolation to integration with Europe and the rest of the world. It has been a remarkable journey. You and your people have made the most of the triumph of freedom after the cold war. We thank you for your example and for your leadership and your friendship, and we welcome you. Thank you.
Today we celebrate one of history's most remarkable triumphs of human freedom, the anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, surely one of the happiest and most important days of the 20th century.
For the young people, the undergraduates who are here who were, at that time, 9 or 10 years old, it must be hard to sense the depth of oppression of the communist system, the sense of danger that gripped America and the world. I still remember all of our air-raid drills when I was in grade school, preparing for the nuclear war as if we got in some basement, it would be all right. [Laughter] It, therefore, may be hard to imagine the true sense of exuberance and pride that the free world felt a decade ago.
So today I say to you, it is important to recall the major events of that period, to remember the role America was privileged to play in the victory of freedom in Europe, to review what we have done since, to realize the promise of that victory, and most important of all, to reaffirm our determination to finish the job, to complete a Europe whole, free, democratic, and at peace, for the first time in all of history.
Let's start by looking back a decade ago at Berlin. If the Soviet empire was a prison, then Berlin was the place where everyone could see the bars and look behind them. On one side of the wall lived a free people, shaping their destiny in the image of their dreams. On the other lived a people who desperately wanted to be free, that had found themselves trapped beyond a wall of deadly uniformity and daily indignities, in an empire that, indeed, could only exist behind a wall, for, ever if an opening appeared, letting ideas in and people out, the whole structure surely would collapse.
In the end, that is exactly what happened in the fall of 1989. Poland and Hungary already were on the road to democracy. President Gorbachev of the Soviet Union had made clear that Soviet forces would not stand in their way. Then Hungary opened its borders to the West, allowing East Germans to escape. Then the dam broke. Berliners took to the street, shouting, ""We are one people."" And on November 9th, a decade ago, the wall was breached. Two weeks later, the Velvet Revolution swept Czechoslovakia, started by university students, just like the undergraduates here, marching through Prague, singing the Czech version of ""We Shall Overcome."" Then, in Romania, the dictator Ceausescu fell in the bloody uprising. A little more than a year later, the Soviet Union itself was no more. A democratic Russia was born.
Those events transformed our world and changed our lives and shaped the future of the young people in this grand room today. Yes, the students of our era will still grow to live in a world full of danger, but probably, and hopefully, they will not have to live in fear of a total war in which millions could be killed in a single deadly exchange. Yes, America will still bear global responsibilities, but we will be able to invest more of our wealth in the welfare of our children and more of our energy in peaceful pursuits.
You will compete in a global marketplace, travel to more places than any generation before you, share ideas and experiences with people from every culture, more and more of whom have embraced and will continue to embrace both democracy and free markets.
How did all this happen? Well, mostly it happened because, from the very beginning, oppressed people refused to accept their fate; not in Poland in 1981, when Lech Walesa jumped over the wall at the Gdansk Shipyard and Solidarity first went on strike, or in Czechoslovakia, during the Prague Spring of 1968. I was there a year and a half later as a young student, and I never will forget the look in the eyes of the university students then and their determination eventually to be free.
They did not accept their fate in Hungary in 1956, or even in St. Petersburg way back in 1920, when the sailors who had led the Soviet revolution first rose against their new oppressors. They did not accept their fate in any Soviet home where the practice of religion was preserved, though it was suppressed by the state, or in countless acts of resistance we have never heard of, committed by heroes whose names we will never know.
The amazing fact is that all those years of repression simply failed to crush people's spirits or their hunger for freedom. Years of lies just made them want the truth that much more. Years of violence just made them want peaceful struggle and peaceful politics that much more. Though denied every opportunity to express themselves, when they were finally able to do it, they did a remarkable job of saying quite clearly what they believed and what they wanted: democratic citizenship and the blessings of ordinary life.
Of course, their victory also would not have been possible without the perseverance of the United States and our allies, standing firm against the Iron Curtain and standing firm with the friends of freedom behind it. Fifty years ago, when all this began, it was far from certain that we would do that. It took determination: the determination of President Truman to break the blockade of the Soviet Union of Berlin, to send aid to Greece and Turkey, to meet aggression in Korea. It took the determination of all his successors to ensure that Soviet expansion went not further than it did.
It took vision: the vision of American leaders who launched the Marshall plan and brought Germany into NATO, not just to feed Europe or to defend it but to unify it as never before, around freedom and democracy. It took persistence: the persistence of every President, from Eisenhower to Kennedy to Bush, to pursue policies for four decades until they bore fruit.
It took resources to bolster our friends and build a military that adversaries ultimately knew they could not match. It took faith to believe that we could prevail while avoiding both appeasement and war; that our open society would in time prove stronger than any closed and fearful society.
It took conviction: the conviction of President Reagan, who said so plainly what many people on the other side of the Wall had trouble understanding, that the Soviet empire was evil and the wall should be torn down; the conviction of President Carter, who put us on the side of dissidents and kept them alive to fight another day.
And it took leadership in building alliances and keeping them united in crisis after crisis and, finally, under President Bush, in managing skillfully the fall of the Soviet empire and the unification of Germany and setting the stage for a Europe whole and free.
This was the situation, the remarkable situation that I inherited when I took office in 1993. The cold war had been won. But in many ways, Europe was still divided, between the haves and have-nots, between the secure and insecure, between members of NATO and the EU and those who were not members of either body and felt left out in the cold, between those who had reconciled themselves with people of different racial and religious and ethnic groups within their borders and those who were still torn apart by those differences.
And so we set out to do for the Eastern half of Europe what we helped to do for the Western half after World War II: to provide investment and aid, to tear down trade barriers so new democracies could stand on their feet economically; to help them overcome tensions that had festered under communism; and to stand up to the forces of aggression and hate, as we did in the Balkans; to expand our institutions, beginning with NATO, so that a Europe of shared values could become a Europe of shared responsibilities and benefits.
Since then, there have unquestionably been some setbacks, some small and some great. Under communism, most everyone was equally poor. Now, some people race ahead while others lag far behind. Former dissidents who once struggled for freedom are now politicians trying to create jobs, to fight corruption and crime, to provide basic security for people who are simply tired of having to struggle.
Most terrible of all have been the wars in the former Yugoslavia, which claimed a quartermillion lives and pushed millions from their homes. But still, 10 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, most of Europe is unquestionably better off, as these two leaders so clearly demonstrate.
Democracy has taken root, from Estonia in the north to Bulgaria in the south. Some of the most vibrant economies in the world now lie east of the old Iron Curtain. Russia has withdrawn its troops from Central Europe and the Baltics, accepted the independence of its neighbors and, for all its own problems, has not wavered from the path of democracy.
The armed forces of most every country, from Ukraine to Romania all the way to Central Asia, now actually train with NATO. NATO has three new allies, Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, three strong democracies that have stood with us in every crisis, from Iraq to Bosnia to Kosovo. Other new democracies are eager to join us as well, including Slovakia, and they know our alliance is open to all who are ready to meet its obligations. Eleven countries are beginning a process that will lead them to membership in the European Union.
And just as important, because we and our allies stood up to ethnic cleansing in Bosnia and Kosovo, the century is not ending on a note of despair with the knowledge that innocent men, women, and children on the doorstep of NATO can be expelled and killed simply because of their ethnic heritage and the way they worship their God. Instead, it ends with a ringing affirmation of the inherent human dignity of every individual, with our alliance of 19 democracies strong and united, working with partners across the continent, including Russia, to keep the peace in the Balkans, with new hope for a Europe that can be, for the first time in history, undivided, democratic, and at peace. I hope all of you will be proud of what your country and its allies have achieved, but I hope you will be even more determined to finish the job, for there is still much to be done.
On Friday, I will leave on a trip to Greece and Turkey, Italy and Bulgaria. This trip is about reinforcing ties with some of our oldest allies and completing the unfinished business of building that stable, unified, and democratic Europe. I believe there are three principal remaining challenges to that vision that we must meet across the Atlantic and, I might say, one great challenge we must meet at home.
The first is the challenge of building the right kind of partnership with Russia, a Russia that is stable, democratic, and cooperatively engaged with the West. That is difficult to do because Russia is struggling economically. It has tens of thousands of weapons scientists—listen to this—it has tens of thousands of weapons scientists making an average of $100 a month, struggling to maintain the security of a giant nuclear arsenal. It has mired itself again in a cruel cycle of violence in Chechnya that is claiming many innocent lives.
We should protect our interests with Russia and speak plainly about actions we believe are wrong. But we should also remember what Russia is struggling to overcome and the legacy with which it must deal. Less than a generation ago, the Russians were living in a society that had no rule of law, no private initiative, no truthtelling, no chance for individuals to shape their own destiny. Now they live in a country with a free press, with almost a million small businesses, a country that should experience next year its first democratic transfer of power in a thousand years.
Russia's transformation has just begun. It is incomplete. It is awkward. Sometimes it is not pretty, but we have a profound stake in its success. Years from now, I don't think we will be criticized, any of us, for doing too much to help. But we can certainly be criticized if we do too little.
A second challenge will be to implement, with our allies, a plan for stability in the Balkans, so that region's bitter ethnic problems can no longer be exploited by dictators and Americans do not have to cross the Atlantic again to fight in another war. We will do that by strengthening democracies in the region, promoting investment and trade, bringing nations steadily into Western institutions, so they feel a unifying magnet that is more powerful than the internal forces that divide them.
I want to say that again—I am convinced that the only way to avoid future Balkan wars is to integrate the countries of Southeastern Europe more with each other and then more with the rest of Europe. We have to create positive forces that pull the people toward unity, which are stronger than the forces of history pulling them toward division, hatred, and death.
We must also push for a democratic transition in Serbia. Mr. Milosevic is the last living relic of the age of European dictators of the Communist era. That era came crashing down with the Wall. He sought to preserve his dictatorship by substituting Communist totalitarianism with ethnic hatred and the kind of mindless unity that follows if you are bound together by your hatred of people who are different from you. The consequences have been disastrous—not only for the Bosnians and the Kosovars but for the Serbs as well.
If we are going to make democracy and tolerance the order of the day in the Balkans, so that they, too, can tap into their innate intelligence and ingenuity and enjoy prosperity and freedom, there can be no future for him and his policy of manipulating human differences for inhuman ends.
A third challenge is perhaps the oldest of them all, and in some ways, perhaps the hardest: to build a lasting peace in the Aegean Sea region, to achieve a true reconciliation between Greece and Turkey, and bridge the gulf between Europe and the Islamic world.
When I am in Greece, I'm going to speak about the vital role Greece is playing and can play in Europe. The world's oldest democracy is a model to the younger democracies of the Balkans, a gateway to their markets, a force for stability in the region. The one thing standing between Greece and its true potential is the tension in its relationship with Turkey.
Greece and Turkey, ironically, are both our NATO Allies, and each other's NATO Allies. They have served together with distinction in the Balkans. Their people helped each other with great humanity when the terrible earthquakes struck both lands earlier this year. This is a problem that can be solved. Eventually, it will be solved. And I intend to see that the United States does everything we possibly can to be of help. When I go to Turkey, I will point out that much of the history of the 20th century, for better or worse, was shaped by the way the old Ottoman Empire collapsed before and after World War I, and the decisions that the European powers made in the aftermath.
I believe the coming century will be shaped in good measure by the way in which Turkey, itself, defines its future and its role today and tomorrow, for Turkey is a country at the crossroads of Europe, the Middle East, and Central Asia. The future can be shaped for the better if Turkey can become fully a part of Europe, as a stable, democratic, secular, Islamic nation.
This, too, can happen if there is progress in overcoming differences with Greece, especially over Cyprus, if Turkey continues to strengthen respect for human rights, and if there is a real vision on the part of our European allies, who must be willing to reach out and to believe that it is at Turkey where Europe and the Muslim world can meet in peace and harmony, to give us a chance to have the future of our dreams in that part of the world in the new millennium.
Now the last challenge is one we can only meet here at home. We have to decide, quite simply, to maintain the tradition of American leadership and engagement in the world that played such a critical role in winning the cold war and in helping us to win the peace over this last decade.
Think about it: We spent trillions of dollars in the cold war to defeat a single threat to our way of life. Now we are at the height of our power and prosperity. Let me just ask you to focus on this and measure where we are as against what has been happening in the debate about maintaining our leadership. We have the lowest unemployment rate in this country in 30 years, the lowest welfare rolls in 30 years, the lowest crime rates in 30 years, the lowest poverty rates in 20 years, the first back-to-back budget surpluses in 42 years, and the smallest Federal Government in 37 years. In my lifetime, we have never had—ever—as a people, the opportunity we now have to build the future of our dreams for our children.
In the early 1960's, we had an economy that closely approximated this, but we had to deal with the challenge of civil rights at home and also the Vietnam war abroad. Today, we are not burdened by crisis at home or crisis abroad, and the world is out there, looking to see what we are going to do with the blessings God has bestowed upon us at this moment in time.
Everything else I said will either happen or not happen without American involvement unless we make up our minds that we are going to stay with the approach to the world that has brought us to this happy point in human history. That is the most important decision of all.
Now, what are we doing? Well, first, our military budget is growing again to meet new demands. That has to happen. But I want to point out to all of you, it is still, in real terms, $110 billion less than it was when the Berlin Wall fell. Everyone agrees that most of that money should be reinvested here at home. But don't you think just a small part of the peace dividend should be invested in maintaining the peace we secured and meeting the unmet challenges of the 21st century?
Look at all the money we spent at such great cost over the last 50 years. The amazing fact is we are not spending a penny more today to advance our interest in the spread of peace, democracy, and free markets than we did during the 1980's. Indeed, we are spending $4 billion less each year.
I think it's worth devoting some small fraction of this Nation's great wealth and power to help build a Europe where wars don't happen, where our allies can do their share and we help them to do so; to seize this historic opportunity for peace between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East; to make sure that nuclear weapons from the former Soviet Union don't fall into the wrong hands; to make sure that the nuclear scientists have enough money to live on and to feed their families by doing constructive, positive things so they're not vulnerable to the entreaties of the remaining forces of destruction in the world; to relieve the debts of the most impoverished countries on Earth, so they can grow their economies, build their democracies, and be good, positive partners with us in the new century; and to meet our obligations to and through the United Nations, so that we can share the burden of leadership with others, when it obviously has such good results.
I think most Americans agree with this. But some disagree, and it appears they are disproportionately represented—[laughter]—in the deciding body. Some believe America can and should go it alone, either withdrawing from the world and relying primarily on our military strength or by seeking to impose our will when things are happening that don't suit us.
Well, I have taken the stand for a different sort of approach—for a foreign affairs budget that will permit us to advance our most critical priorities around the world. That's why I vetoed the first bill that reached my desk, why I'm pleased that Democrats and Republicans in Congress worked together last week on a strong compromise that meets many of our goals. But we're not finished yet. We still must work to get funding for our United Nations obligations and authorization to allow the use of IMF resources for debt relief.
This is a big issue. It has captured public attention as never before. I mean, just think about it: This initiative for debt relief for the millennium is being headlined by the Pope and Bono, the lead singer for U2. [Laughter] That is a very broad base of support for this initiative. [Laughter] Most of the rest of us can be found somewhere in between that—our pole-star leaders there.
But it's not just a political issue. It is the smart thing to do. If you go to Africa, you see what competent countries can do to get the AIDS rate down, to build democratic structures, to build successful economies and grow. But we have to give them a chance. And the same is true in Latin America, in the Caribbean, in other places. This is a big issue.
I hope the bipartisan agreement we reached over the weekend on the foreign affairs budget is a good sign that we are now moving to reestablish and preserve the bipartisan center that believes in America's role in the new post-coldwar world.
In the coming year, we have an ambitious agenda that also deserves bipartisan support. We have about 100 days to meet the ambitious timetable the leaders of the Middle East have set for themselves to achieve a framework agreement. We have to secure the peace in the Balkans. We have to ease tensions between India and Pakistan. We have to help Russia to stabilize its economy, resolve the conflict in Chechnya, and cheer them on as they have their first democratic transfer of power, ever.
We have to bring China into the World Trade Organization, while continuing to speak plainly about human rights and religious freedom. We have to launch a new global trade round, enact the African and Caribbean trade bills, press ahead with debt relief, support the hopeful transitions to democracy in Nigeria and Indonesia, help Colombia defeat the narcotraffickers, contain Iraq, and restrain North Korea's missile program. We have to continue to do more to fight terrorism around the world. And we must do what is necessary—and for the young people here, I predict for 20 years this will become a national security issue—we have to do more to reverse the very real phenomenon of global warming and climate change.
To meet those challenges and more, we simply must hold on to the qualities that sustained us throughout the long cold war, the wisdom to see that America benefits when the rest of the world is moving toward freedom and prosperity, to recognize that if we wait until problems come home to America before we act, they will come home to America.
We need the determination to stand up to the enemies of peace, whether tyrants like Milosevic or terrorists like those who attacked our Embassies in Africa. We need faith in our own capacity to do what is right, even when it's hard, whether that means building peace in the Middle East or democracy in Russia or a constructive partnership with China. We need the patience to stick with those efforts for as long as it takes and the resources to see them through. And most of all, we need to maintain the will to lead, to provide the kind of American leadership that for 50 years has brought friends and allies to our side, while moving mountains around the world.
Years from now, I want people to say those were the qualities of this generation of Americans. I want them to say that when the cold war ended, we refused to settle for the easy satisfaction of victory, to walk home and let our European friends go it alone. We did not allow the larger prize of a safer, better world to slip through our fingers. We stood and supported the Germans as they bravely reunified, and supported the Europeans as they built a true union and expanded it. We stood against ethnic slaughter and ethnic cleansing. We stood for the right kind of partnership with Russia. We acted to try to help Christian and Jewish and Muslim people reconcile themselves in the Middle East, and in the bridge represented by Turkey's outreach to Europe. I want them to say that America followed through, so that we would not have to fight again.
A few months ago, my family and I went to a refugee camp full of children from Kosovo. They were chanting their appreciation to the United States, thanking America for giving them a chance to reclaim their lives. It was an incredibly moving event, with children who have been traumatized far beyond their ability even to understand what has happened to them but who know they have been given a chance to go home now.
Years from now, I believe the young people in this audience will have a chance to go to Europe time and time again, and you will, doubtless, meet some of those children or maybe some of the young people who actually tore down the Berlin Wall or marched in the Velvet Revolution. They will be older then. I hope they will say, ""When I was young I sang America's praises with my voice, but I still carry them in my heart."" I think that will be true if America stays true. That is what we ought to resolve to do on the anniversary of this marvelous triumph of freedom.
Thank you very much.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-georgetown-university-0
Bill Clinton,"November 08, 1999",Press Briefing by Joe Lockhart,"The Briefing Room
1:10 P.M. EST
MR. LOCKHART: We'll do a couple of announcements before we get started. One is, the President in his departure statement at about 2:15 p.m. will be discussing the importance of reducing class size. He will reference a new Department of Education study on reducing class size on the local level. Mr. Bruce Reed and Secretary of Education Riley will be here in The Briefing Room as soon as I'm done to discuss that study with you.
Secondly, the President, as part of our efforts to reach an agreement on WTO, has asked Charlene Barshefsky to travel to China, which she will be doing today, for two days of talks to see if we can reach an agreement with the Chinese on a viable basis for accession into WTO. Charlene will take a team with her. She will also -- traveling with her as part of the team will be Gene Sperling, the President's National Economic Council Advisor.
Q: Do you expect China will be -- are you going to make a bid for her to get in?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, we've argued for some time that we believe it's in the U.S. interest for China to enter into the WTO. As you know now, the U.S. market remains open to the world, including the Chinese, but we don't have the kind of access that we need and deserve -- or American companies do -- to Chinese markets. So we're going to continue working. We want a commercially-viable agreement. We're going to wait until we get a good agreement, but I think the President felt it was worthwhile to have Charlene travel to China to see if we can make progress.
Q: Where are we with the deal? Are we where we were in April? Are we further, are we not as far?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, again, as you know, in Auckland the two Presidents agreed to restart these talks and also agreed that there was no reason to try to negotiate in public. So on the substance of the agreement, we'll leave it where it is, where we've left it for the last couple weeks. But the President believed, as did the team here, that it would be worthwhile to travel there and have the parties meet face-to-face, and engage in a couple days of discussions.
Q: Where does it stand right now? After all, the President really came close to the brink and retreated the last time.
MR. LOCKHART: Well, listen, I'm not going to get into the substance of the talks. And I'm also --
Q: I'm not asking you to get into the substance, I'm asking you where does it stand.
MR. LOCKHART: Listen, I'm also not going to buy into the conventional wisdom that's been bought into by many in this town about where we might have been in April, and what might have happened, and where the President is or isn't. We've always said we want a good deal. We are not going to go forward until we have a good deal. So you should assume that where we were earlier in the year wasn't good enough.
Q: Where are you now?
Q: -- on the China-WTO. The President called Jiang about two weeks ago or so, and was waiting for a call back, or some correspondence back. Can you give us any details to what happened?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, as you know, as a close follower of these briefings and the sometimes tortuous answers that I'm forced to give, there have been discussions but I'm not going to get into at what level and with whom.
Q: Was there another phone call this weekend?
MR. LOCKHART: If I'm not going to answer that one, I'm not going to answer that one.
Q: Are they bringing a specific proposal to the Chinese?
MR. LOCKHART: Not that I'm aware of. My understanding is they're going to meet face to face, which I think they haven't done in some time, and see if they can make some progress.
Q: Can you say what has changed, what is precipitating this trip now at this point?
MR. LOCKHART: I don't know that there's anything specific precipitating this substantively. We have talked about trying to get something done in advance of WTO -- WTO is fast approaching. But I think the purpose of this is to see if we can make progress.
Q: Do you think that there's been any change at all to the U.S. position that April is a bottom line deal? Is that still the minimum, what we had in April, will that still be the minimum for U.S. negotiators?
MR. LOCKHART: Again, I'm not going to get into the negotiations and what the bottom line is, only to say that we believe it's in our interest to have China ascend into the WTO on commercially viable terms. And that's what we're working for.
Q: But you've gotten into that before. You've said before that April is the bottom line.
MR. LOCKHART: I certainly haven't.
Q: Do you think China will be admitted to the WTO in the Seattle conference?
MR. LOCKHART: I don't think there is any way to predict one way or the other on that.
Q: -- was in India for religious harmony, but here in this country Southern Baptists issued reports against Hinduism, asking that they want to convert Hindus in this country and in India.
MR. LOCKHART: Well, I haven't seen that specific report, but I think you all heard --
Q: -- the Washington Post and --
MR. LOCKHART: But I think you've all heard the President speak very passionately about the need for religious freedom and expression. I think the Pope has made important statements on that subject over the weekend and in India, and it's something that we should practice here at home, too.
Q: Joe, have you gotten any indication from Congress that if you were to get a deal with the Chinese, that they would be willing to take it up anytime soon?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, we believe that this -- if we can do this in a way that promotes the interests of American business, American working families, that those voices will be heard in Congress. We have no specific commitment. We have, in fact --
Q: -- heard some of the leaders say that they don't want to take it up this year.
MR. LOCKHART: Well, we have negative statements from the majority leader in the House, and the majority leader in the Senate, that say no matter what the deal is, they don't want to work for it. But we think that if we can conclude a deal, and members of Congress hear from their constituents -- whether they be working families or, as with many of the Republicans, the business community is quite an important voice -- that they will take another look at this.
Q: Do they have to approve this for China to get in?
MR. LOCKHART: Yes, there are some legislative -- there are some Jackson-Vanik waivers involved. I think the President has said that he'd move to a permanent NTR for China if we concluded a deal.
Q: Is it true that the President was advised not to take the deal last time because Congress would not pass it? That Rubin and others said that it was unlikely that Congress would approve it?
MR. LOCKHART: Listen, I'm not going to get into the confidential advice that's given to the President. But I will repeat that we didn't feel that we had the kind of deal we wanted to move forward with.
Q: Is there any way to get it done by the end of the month?
MR. LOCKHART: There's no way to predict that. I think both sides are serious about this. I don't want to preclude that it couldn't get done, but I also don't want to raise expectations that it will get done.
Q: Who will Barshefsky and Sperling meet with?
MR. LOCKHART: That I'd refer you -- okay. We'll check with USTR on that. I just don't have that.
Q: Joe, when the President talked about this the other day, he said that in April the climate was such that a lot of people were very anti-China. The very people who are calling for the deal now were bashing China back then, he said. Is it the White House's assessment that people have moved away from that to a more pro-China stance?
MR. LOCKHART: I think the climate is more positive right now, as far as congressional rhetoric on China. I think the President made the proper point, that many of the people, now, who are calling for a deal are the ones who were most vociferous in their condemnation of the Chinese government earlier in the year.
I think the other element of this is, there are a lot of people who will be positively impacted in this country by a deal. And I think those people have made their voices heard. Now, whether that's enough to swing congressional, the congressional majority, a majority of votes for this, I think it's impossible to know at this point.
Q: Joe, Rush Limbaugh sometime ago mentioned on his radio that several countries are lining up for presidential speeches, including, at that time, Indonesia and China and Malaysia. Is the President preparing for making any speeches or appearing --
MR. LOCKHART: Well, the noted foreign policy advisor, Rush Limbaugh, has a memo into the President on suggested travel. We have a memo into him on suggested travel, and hopefully we can meet some sort of agreement. We have a very ambitious schedule outside the country for Rush, and if he's interested we'd be happy to see if private methods of funding that.
Q: Is he going on the same trip Lester is going on? (Laughter.)
MR. LOCKHART: God, I hope so.
Q: Joe, on education, why should a school district that is not in need of more teachers be dictated to by the federal government that it has to use that money for teachers, as opposed to, let's say that it needs some new gym equipment or it needs computers.
MR. LOCKHART: Well, let me tell you, we believe that the most pressing need that we can address right now is getting more teachers in the classroom, especially in the early grades. We have enough evidence of it now, you'll have some more evidence of it by the briefers who come out after me.
I think the way the Republicans have structured the funding for this, not only could you not see more teachers, you could see less students. Under the provision that they want to move forward, this money could be used for vouchers, private vouchers, that could drain resources away from public schools, putting them to private schools. And that's absolutely the wrong direction.
And if you need evidence, if you want to go out and look at other areas, just look at the tobacco settlement that was made with the states. This was money negotiated to go toward public health and reducing teen smoking. And all of you who drive in from Northern Virginia in the next couple years are going to have tobacco companies to thank for the third lane -- they're using it for a highway project.
And if you go around the country, you'll find that this isn't being used for public health or reducing teen smoking. It's being used to fill whatever budget hall exists. We believe this is discreet money that should go to addressing a major problem, a major challenge to our public schools in this country. That's why Republicans voted for it in 1998; Democrats voted for it -- it passed and they ought to continue that commitment.
Q: Well, what do you say to a school board that says, we don't really need new teachers, but we could use this money and put it toward something else?
MR. LOCKHART: Should the few school boards around the country who have enough teachers, who don't believe there is a shortage and don't need to put more, they can certainly use this money for teachers, thus freeing up some other resources that they can use.
But I think if you go around the country -- there was just a story yesterday in the state of Maryland about the severe shortage they have with teachers. It's important that we use this money -- just like we did -- targeted money, with the COPS program, to address a particular need.
Q: Joe, is the President critical of the way Virginia's chosen to use that money from tobacco?
MR. LOCKHART: No, I think the President is -- he's certainly critical of the state's -- I mean, basically with the tobacco money, we agreed if states used the funds for public health, that we wouldn't seek to recoup the 57 percent share that should come back to the federal government. Now, obviously, we've had a debate on that. But I think the President believes that states should use the money for public health, to reduce teen smoking. That's one of the foundations we had in trying to negotiate a national settlement.
But that's not what many states around the country have done. There are certainly some who have. But there's examples of others -- I mean, that was the one that sprung to mind, because there was some attention to that a couple weeks here, locally. I don't mean to single Virginia out. There are certainly other states that have chosen to use it for other funds. But I think it makes the case for why, with a challenge as large as reducing class size, that this is the right approach to take.
Q: But isn't all the money fungible? I mean, they're not using it for one priority, that leaves them more money available to use for the priorities that you might want them to.
MR. LOCKHART: Well, I mean this is additional money that will go into schools to get teachers in the classroom. It's the same approach we took when we decided to put additional money to local communities to hire more police. And I think the record speaks for itself there. We have the lowest crime rate in 30 years. It's reduced over the last seven years, in no small part to initiatives like community policing.
Q: You made your answer to John's last question sound like, the education money you want would be semi-fungible, too. In other words, are you saying, if the school district doesn't use that money to hire more teachers, but simply to pay existing teachers, it can use that money that came from the federal government and move it over to something else?
MR. LOCKHART: No. I mean, as I understand it -- Secretary Riley will be in here. You can get him on some more of the details. But my understanding is, this is to hire, to bring in -- it's money that's targeted for bringing in additional teachers to reduce class size.
Q: Joe, so what about your statement that it was somewhat fungible, as John said? What about your previous statement?
MR. LOCKHART: You interpreted my statement. I didn't say that it was somewhat fungible.
Q: But you said it could simply be used to pay teachers and then they could use other money to pay for other things.
MR. LOCKHART: No, this is --
MR. TOIV: If class size down to a particular point, then they can use it for other purposes.
Q: So what's the target limit -- 18 students per class, and whatever money is left over --
MR. LOCKHART: Yes. Obviously, this is in the -- what is it, 1st through 3rd grade? It's somewhere in the lower grades. We can find out the details.
Q: If they get class size down to 18 students per class in kindergarten through 3rd grade, or whatever, whatever money is left over after they do that they can build an HOV lane in the parking lot if they want?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, obviously, there is money available for them to do all those things. This is particular money that goes to them for reducing class size.
Q: Joe, can you talk about tonight's on-line town meeting and what the President hopes to accomplish?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, I think this is an innovative new program that is being done in connection between the DLC, which the President has done a number of events with each year since he's been in office, and the EXCITE Company. The President hopes to speak to both elected officials around the country in the his virtual town hall or virtual auditorium, and then get a chance to take questions from around the country from people who have logged in.
So I think it's in the tradition of town halls that is so much the part of our system, this is basically town halls using the latest technology. So I think it will be a chance to exchange ideas both with some locally elected officials and with Americans from around the country.
Q: Joe, on the education stuff again, you and Podesta have taken a very hard line on that in the last couple of days. Do you see any room for a compromise on this issue, or is this something where you're going to have to get what you want and then maybe trade for something else on another subject?
MR. LOCKHART: I mean, I think the President has made clear, and he will make clear again later today, what an important priority this is for him, how we need to continue our commitment to reducing class sizes by getting more teachers in, and how damaging a broadly-worded proposal that might eventually mean doing things like funding vouchers, which is diametrically opposed to what we're trying to do here.
We're trying to get more teachers into the classroom, not siphon off students and resources from the public schools. And I think this is, as the Chief of Staff said yesterday, a bottom-line position. And it should come as no surprise to members where we are. This is something we've talked about all year, we talked about all last year. We were here at this same position somewhat earlier last year than we are now, so I think that it's -- we're surprised they're surprised.
Q: Joe, can you give the White House thinking of when it's proper, when do you folks think it's proper to weigh in and give an opinion on the antitrust --
MR. LOCKHART: Well, there is an entire regulatory process that the government manages that is used as far as mergers and antitrust issues, and that's the proper place.
Q: Well, what about with remedies? Is it proper for the White House to give its opinion on what the proper remedy is?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, I think when there is something that's pending litigation, it is best for the talking to be done by the administration in the courtroom, rather than any place else.
Q: But you will at some point, if you continue to win, if the government continues to win, have to give it a sense of what you think a proper remedy is? Would that be something the White House --
MR. LOCKHART: Well, I think that's down the road. There are many steps left in this process, so I don't anticipate trying to telegraph what our position may or may not be.
Q: Joe, on the President's comments in USA Today on serving in Vietnam and serving your country makes you a better President, isn't that somewhat hypocritical, given that he didn't want to serve back in Vietnam and why the change of heart?
MR. LOCKHART: It's not a change in heart and I think it's quite honest. Read the whole quote.
Q: Excuse me. And was he also taking a jab at Bush and Bradley? I mean, in this -- two other candidates?
MR. LOCKHART: No. No, he was asked a question and he answered it, which is that it shouldn't be disqualifying, but the experience you gain by serving is certainly a plus.
Q: Do you know the name of the Prime Minister of India?
MR. LOCKHART: Vajpayee. And if anyone else wants to ask me questions, I've got a whole book here, so I can spend all afternoon with you.
Q: -- the CIA?
MR. LOCKHART: Hold on a second. (Laughter.)
Q: And are you sharing that with the candidates?
MR. LOCKHART: They know my number. (Laughter.)
Q: Joe, were there any budget talks this morning and what's the schedule for this afternoon?
MR. LOCKHART: Not that I'm aware of. I think they're going to have some discussions this afternoon, so I have no update from this morning as far as talks.
Q: -- going to go down, do you know?
MR. LOCKHART: Yes, I think he'll be up there this afternoon.
Q: Is it your understanding that so far the talks yesterday were only about Interior?
MR. LOCKHART: The only substantive talks were about Interior.
Q: Well, the reason I ask is that you made a big point that you wanted all of these bills to be discussed comprehensively in one big omnibus group, and it seems like, the way the negotiations have been going, you have been taking this one bill at a time, you haven't been trading money between bills.
MR. LOCKHART: No, we wanted them to put down all of their ideas. And once they got through their process of the bills we had a much better sense of what the overall picture was. Now the conversations have moved back between bills, we just happen to be on Interior now.
Q: But have you traded any -- has there been any suggestion, in terms of offsets and paying for things, to actually trade money between things, or are the total amounts staying the same for each appropriations bill, as the Congress has --
MR. LOCKHART: I'm not sure I know the answer to that. I know that the discussions have -- we certainly have a sense of what the overall picture is, of the issues and the money. And now we're working through, in some cases, bill by bill, in some cases, provision by provision. They just yesterday happened to spend a good bit of time on Interior, which I expect them to continue on today.
Q: But as far as you know, the total amount appropriated for each bill has not changed, in other words?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, no, that's part of the process we're going through now. We believe on the education bill that there needs to be some additional money. We believe that on Commerce-State-Justice, we need to fund U.N. arrears, and we're going to have discussion about how you do that and how you pay for it. That's what the process is.
Q: You're talking about additional money in education -- or I thought the President keeps on saying this is not about the amount, it's about how it gets done?
MR. LOCKHART: The education bill, particularly on teachers, that's a question of whether it's subject to authorization or not and how the language is. In Commerce-State-Justice, there is money needed, additional money needed to pay U.N. arrears. That's something that is part of the discussions.
Q: Joe, PRI, the party that's been governing Mexico for over 70 years yesterday held its first ever presidential primary. What is the --
MR. LOCKHART: Well, you know, we support that effort. We believe that the holding of the primary deepens Mexico's commitment to democracy. And that's something that they should be applauded for.
Q: Is the White House and Labor Department close to announcing proposed regulations on expanding family leave so that you could use unemployment insurance?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, we've talked in the past -- on the specific question, I don't know where we are on the regs. But we certainly have talked in the past about working with states and trying to set up pilot projects where we use unemployment insurance for leave for newborns. And that's a process that continues.
Q: Is there any pressure here to get the budget done by mid-week, before the President leaves? Is that a sort of an artificial deadline here? Can you just --
MR. LOCKHART: It's an artificial deadline just in the sense that by the end of the week we'll be gone for a little bit more than a week. It is not a date certain that the President is going to give up on his commitments, particularly on things like teachers and cops. You know, we will be here. We know that members would like to get home. We think it would be a positive thing for members to get home and spend time with their constituents. But we will be here. We have some bottom-line concerns that have to be met.
Q: If there's no deal, he leaves anyhow? He goes on the trip?
MR. LOCKHART: If there's not a deal done on all of the issues this week, we'll continue talking next week.
Q: Any comment on the possibility of Japan joining the U.S.-North Korea missile talks?
MR. LOCKHART: Why don't we come back to that. Let me see if I have anything.
Q: Just mechanically, Joe, what's the mechanics if he leaves Friday, and there's a CR expiring while he's away?
MR. LOCKHART: You know, I think we have a CR expiring Thursday, right -- Wednesday. So if we don't get something done by Wednesday, we will go further. I think that while it may present some logistical challenge to people, it will not present any substantive challenges. They will have a way of getting all of this done.
Q: Realistically, is it possible to conclude a deal while he's out of the country, do you think?
MR. LOCKHART: Nothing is impossible. We find a way when we're overseas to continue to stay engaged on domestic issues. My sense, reading the quotes in the paper today, is that the Republican leadership wants to get it wrapped up, wants to get home, to get their members off on the travel that they have scheduled for the end of the month. We'd like to accommodate that, but we've got some bottom-line concerns that need to be met.
Q: Is there any feeling here of optimism that this can get done this week?
MR. LOCKHART: I think it's, at best, a mixed assessment. We've gotten some positive things done and we've gotten them done quickly, once the commitment was there and the sense that we were negotiating with one party was there. We got very quick work done on foreign ops. We made some progress yesterday on Interior. I think there's a sense that this can be done, but I don't think there's anyone here predicting that it will be done.
Q: By the party, you mean the leadership stepped in?
MR. LOCKHART: Yes.
Q: -- in the New Yorker about a Richard Jewel file the President kept about unfavorable or unfair press coverage accurate?
MR. LOCKHART: Not to my knowledge. I've never seen anything like that. It's certainly never on his desk, which I spent a lot of time looking at.
Q: Joe, the parents of Matthew Shepard were in meeting with Mr. Podesta and Ms. Reno today. How would the passage of federal hate crimes legislation have changed the outcome of that trial, which saw the perpetrators of the crime go to jail for life?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, I'm not sure that it would have had an impact on that particular trial, but I think they will argue, and they will argue for themselves, that there are gaps in state laws around the country and that we do need an expanded sense and expanded powers to prosecute federal hate crimes. And I think what the Chief of Staff took out of that meeting was not only the family's commitment, but the very real commitment on the part of the members of the Larimie Police Department that were here, who made a strong case for the hate crimes legislation and will go up to the Hill and make it directly to the members.
Q: Are you optimistic the Medicare giveback -- will reach the President's desk?
MR. LOCKHART: You know, it's certainly one of the, beyond the budget and some of the tax incentives, it's one of the things that Congress is committed to working on. But we still have some work to do on it. I think in that category, we have another, which is minimum wage that is expected to come up tomorrow And I expect the President to address before he leaves here. And I think there is an example of something that I think defines the difference between the parties on Capitol Hill.
You've got the Democrats who are pushing for people who are making $5.15 an hour to help more than 10 million Americans get a raise -- a dollar over two years; to really help them in their continuing effort to bring down income disparity and help families who are working hard just to make it. On the other side, you have the majority party who has proposed -- saying, well, okay, if you help people at the bottom, you've got to provide tens of billions of dollars in tax breaks for the wealthiest. There is a Citizens for Tax Justice study that says that something like one percent of Americans will get more than 75 percent of the benefits from the Republican bill.
For the best off Americans, those making over $300,000, they'll get, on average, $6,000 out of this bill. For those in the bottom three-fifths of the economy, they'll get $4. So I think this is something that defines us, and the President is going to work hard and make the case for why we need a minimum wage, but not one loaded up with special interest tax breaks.
Q: Well, those versions are supposed to be attached to a bankruptcy bill tomorrow, and Senator Lott has said that there's no way that the Democratic version is going to -- he just will not support that. So unless you're willing to compromise with them, is the minimum wage bill --
MR. LOCKHART: You know, the Senate bill costs something like $70 billion without pay-fors. So I think -- I guess what Senator Lott is advocating, if you look at the budgetary impact of this, is that we ought to provide a big special interest tax break for big companies and the wealthiest Americans, and we ought to pay for it by going into the Social Security trust fund. That's obviously something we can't support.
Q: Joe, in several of the President's comments about the budget, he insisted that the Republicans, as part of these negotiations, take up his proposal to expand Medicare and increase its solvency, and to do the same with Social Security. Have there been any discussions about that during the budget negotiations?
MR. LOCKHART: Not that I'm aware of in terms of the appropriations. I think there have been some discussions at the margins on things like extenders in the balanced budget give-backs between the staff here at the White House and the members. But I don't have any progress to report in the process of the budget talks.
Q: In other words, those would be the vehicles for anything that you would do on Social Security and Medicare --
MR. LOCKHART: Well, certainly on the pay-fors for the balanced budget givebacks, we're looking at finding some savings in the efficiency of how Medicare is run. So that's one of the contexts for the discussions.
Q: But that's all you're talking about? In other words, the prospect of getting anything more comprehensive and significant --
MR. LOCKHART: You know, stranger things have happened. We will continue to make our case. I don't see willingness on the part of the majority appropriators, or negotiators, right now to address those concerns.
Q: Did you receive the banking reform bill yet?
MR. LOCKHART: We didn't have it as of this morning. I don't think we've gotten it yet. The financial modernization? No.
Q: Are you going to have a briefing on the upcoming trip?
MR. LOCKHART: Wednesday. Wednesday. Thursday's a holiday.
Q: What does he hope to achieve from this trip?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, obviously, we're going -- we will be dealing with the OSCE summit, which has its own issues surrounding it. But we will also be traveling to leaders in Southeastern Europe, Greece and Turkey, expanding on our bilateral relations there. We'll have -- pay an important trip to Bulgaria, now almost 10 years into their transformation as a market democracy. I think -- in addition to that, we'll spend a couple days, or a day and a half or so, in Florence, with some European leaders, talking about the international implications of Third Way policies and politics.
So I think it will be quite an important trip on a number of fronts, going back to the important U.S. role in Europe, particularly in Southeastern Europe, and the importance of U.S. leadership in the world, and engagement around the world.
Q: Is he going to announce any additional stops in his speech today?
MR. LOCKHART: No, he's not going to announce any additional stops in his speech today.
Q: Are we -- well.
MR. LOCKHART: I don't have any announcements, either.
Q: Joe, will the President at the OSCE meeting raise Chechnya, in terms of making it a significant issue --
MR. LOCKHART: Certainly, it's back to that, given the agenda for OSCE, that that will be a subject that will be discussed. And the President will I'm sure have the opportunity with other leaders to discuss the latest developments there.
Q: -- the White House, the primary election from the PRI in Mexico?
MR. LOCKHART: I got that one before, but to repeat, we think that the primary election represents a deepening of democracy, which is something that should be applauded -- a deepening commitment to democracy.
Q: Is one of the topics in Sophia possibly Bulgaria's wanting to join NATO?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, I think there are a lot of NATO aspirants, and when we go to those countries it's certainly a topic of conversation. So I expect it will be discussed.
Q: Joe, where is the President going to be when he does the on line thing? Is he doing it from the Oval Office?
MR. LOCKHART: No, George Washington University.
Q: And is this the first time he's ever participated in a town hall --
MR. LOCKHART: It's the first time he's ever -- he did an on line thing once before with the NET AID, that we did about a month ago. But I think this is the first town hall where it's fully interactive, there are leaders around the country and there are questions coming in.
Q: Is this going to be like streaming technology?
MR. LOCKHART: It will certainly include streaming, video and audio.
Q: But he won't actually be on a keyboard or have somebody on a keyboard?
MR. LOCKHART: I think he'll just be talking and there will be people who --
Q: What will they be doing?
MR. LOCKHART: They will be typing.
Q: Who selects the questions?
MR. LOCKHART: I think the DLC and the Excite people are organizing how they're screened and put to the President.
Q: Thank you.

Bill Clinton,"November 09, 1999",Remarks on Budget Negotiations and an Exchange With Reporters,"The President. Good morning. We're about to begin a Cabinet meeting that will be a briefing on the current state of the budget negotiations. As I think all of you know, our budget negotiators have been meeting with congressional leaders almost around the clock in an effort to complete our work and produce a budget that reflects the values of our people, lives within our means, and looks to the future.
We are seeing encouraging signs of real progress in our efforts to put 50,000 community police officers on our streets and keep the crime rate coming down, in our new markets initiative that seeks to bring investment to areas of our country that have not participated fully in our prosperity, in our efforts to preserve and protect our environment. We are even seeing the first signs of agreement.
But there's still a lot of work to be done, a number of critical priorities yet to be resolved. Most important is the commitment to a quality education and our agreement to hire 100,000 new highly qualified teachers to reduce class size in the early grades. We will keep working with Congress to keep the promise that both of us made to the people of America last year.
The Senate's voting on a minimum wage bill today. I urge them to pass a bill that helps more Americans into the circle of opportunity and to do it in a way that does not give unfair and excessive tax breaks to special interests. Congress also needs to pass a strong hate crimes bill to protect more of our citizens from violence and bigotry.
And I am hopeful that we can resolve these issues and the other remaining issues, especially the one involving United Nations dues, so that we can complete our work. It's still possible that we can complete our work in the next few days and get out of here. And we're working hard; Mr. Lew's working hard particularly, and Mr. Podesta and Mr. Ricchetti and others, and I thank them for their efforts. And I'm going to give the Cabinet an update.
Education Legislation
Q. Mr. President, on education, what is really wrong with the Republican idea of giving the money to the school districts and letting them decide whether to buy computers or hire new teachers?
The President. Well, first of all, we have done a great deal for the school districts on computers, and in 4 years we went from 4 of our school districts wired to 51 percent.
Secondly, there is flexibility—Secretary Riley might want to answer this—but there's flexibility in that bill if the schools get their classes down. But Secretary Riley brought that study with him today, we mentioned yesterday, that gives clear evidence that smaller classes in the early grades have permanent learning benefits. And I think that we need to stay with that.
We don't have enough money to spend, in my judgment, to risk wasting any of it. And when the educators and local school leaders and all the educational research agree that something needs to be done and we allocate the money for it, I don't think we should turn around and break the commitment and just say, ""We'll give you a blank check. We don't really care what happens to the money."" We can't afford to waste a penny of the money we spend on education.
UnitedHealthcare
Q. Mr. President, what do you think of a major HMO deciding that doctors should say whether you're sick or well?
The President. Good for them. I applaud them. And they're large enough that they might be really able to do it and have an impact on this.
You know—Secretary Shalala can maybe refresh my memory, but as I remember, when we outlined the principles for a Patients' Bill of Rights in the commission that Secretary Shalala, Secretary Herman headed, I think there were—I don't know—14 or 15 HMO's that agreed right then, but some of them were not big enough to basically withstand the economic competition if they did it and others didn't. So I think it's a wonderful thing they've done, and I hope it's the first step toward a resolution of this issue.
Situation in Chechnya
Q. Mr. President, on Russia and its actions in Chechnya, are you comfortable that they are responding to your appeals for humanitarian concerns, as far as civilian casualties, in that situation there?
The President. I don't think you can use the words ""comfortable"" and ""Chechnya"" in the same sentence, in any way. All I can tell you is that we will continue to press for a minimization of civilian casualties and a maximum use of negotiated options to settle this. I think in the end, there will have to be a political solution, and I hope that the end will come sooner rather than later, so fewer people will die.
Q. But are they responding to you, sir, when you ask them not——
The President. Well, I think the United States and the rest of the world, the more we ask, the more likely it is to occur at a sooner date. But I don't know—I think that if I—however I answer that minimizes the chances that we'll have any influence over the decisions, because I think no country wants to be seen as giving in to pressure from another country. But I think they are listening.
Press Secretary Joe Lockhart. Thank you, everybody.
President's Visit to Greece
Q. Are you confident there will be good security in Greece when you go there?
The President. Oh, I think so. You know, I know that Greece has a long and rich history of communists, anarchists, others on the left, demonstrating, and they all disagreed with my position in Kosovo, as you know. But the United States and Greece are allies not only in NATO but in many other important ways.
We want very badly to see a resolution of the tensions between Greece and Turkey in the Aegean and especially over Cyprus. And I think all Greeks share that hope without regard to their political views. So I expect the demonstrations, and I'm not troubled by them, and I think that the security issues will be fine.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-budget-negotiations-and-exchange-with-reporters-0
Bill Clinton,"November 12, 1999","Press Briefing by National Security Advisor Sandy Berger, Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs Mark Grossman, and Special Assistant to the President At N.S.C. Chris Hill on the President's Trip to Europe","The Briefing Room
2:35 P.M. EST
MR. HAMMER: Good afternoon. We have today the President's National Security Advisor Samuel R. Berger, who will be briefing on our upcoming trip to Europe. And we also have with us Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs Mark Grossman, as well as Chris Hill, Special Assistant to the President at the National Security Council responsible for Southeastern Europe.
Sandy.
MR. BERGER: Good afternoon. On Sunday morning, bright and early, President Clinton will leave on a 10-day trip to Europe. As you know, we will be going to Turkey, Greece, Italy and Bulgaria. And I can confirm today that we are adding an additional stop in Kosovo.
The President has outlined the basic goals of his trip in his speech on Monday commemorating the fall of the Berlin Wall. In the last 10 years we've made considerable progress in helping to build a Europe that is undivided, democratic and at peace. The part of Europe where wars do not happen, where democracy is secure, where markets are open, and where nations share responsibilities is now larger than at any point in history.
The part that still threatens us with conflict and turmoil has shrunk considerably, largely to a few pockets in the southeastern part of the continent. We can eliminate that zone of instability if we meet the remaining challenges -- by promoting stability in the Balkans, democracy in Serbia, reconciliation in the Aegean, a settlement on Cyprus, peace in the Caucasus, and integration of Russia into the global community. Dealing with this unfinished business and strengthening our ties with key allies will be the President's top priorities next week, and is a large part of America's agenda in the coming year.
Let me chronologically go through the agenda, describe each country briefly, and then ask Secretary Grossman and Ambassador Hill then to take the Turkey, Greece and Kosovo parts of it in particular.
We'll begin in Turkey on Monday morning. The President will met with President Demirel and Prime Minister Ecevit, and address the Turkish National Assembly. There will be an opportunity in this speech to encourage Turkey's democratic, modernizing and secular course, which has accelerated under Prime Minister Ecevit; to highlight the critical role Turkey plays from the Balkans to the Middle East to the Caucasus; and to work for progress towards a settlement in Cyprus and further reduction of tensions with Greece.
Tuesday, the President will go to Izmit, the epicenter of the August earthquake, to visit with survivors and talk about what we have done and can do to help.
On Wednesday, we will be in Istanbul. The President will meet with Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, the spiritual leader of the Greek Orthodox Church. During the trip, the President also will meet with the leaders of Turkey's Armenia and Jewish communities. Wednesday afternoon, he will visit Ephesus, once the third city in the Roman Empire and one of the most important classical sites in the region.
On Thursday begins the OSCE summit, gathering of 54 countries in the context of the organization that emerged from the Helsinki Final Act, which, in and of itself, was perhaps the seminal document in terms of the transformation of the European landscape that has taken place in the last 25 years. This is the first OSCE summit since 1996.
The leaders there will sign an OSCE Charter on European Security, which will be the first statement of principles by OSCE on democracy, human rights, security since the Cold War was ending in 1990. This document recognizes that threats to our security are as likely to come from conflicts within states as between them, and it will give OSCE new tools and a new mandate to prevent and manage internal conflict, a role it's begun to play from the Balkans to the Caucasus.
Of course, one backdrop to the summit will be the conflict in Chechnya. We've made it clear that while Russia has the right to protect its territorial integrity and fight terrorism, the indiscriminate use of force against insurgents intermingled with civilians is both wrong and counterproductive, and makes finding a solution more difficult -- something the President conveyed to Prime Minister Putin when we were in Oslo. It also creates what we've seen as substantial humanitarian problems. And I'm sure that the gathering of leaders there will reflect again the cost of Russia's present course to its international standing and credibility.
President Yeltsin has indicated that he intends to attend, and the President will meet with him. In addition to Chechnya, we will discuss with President Yeltsin arms control, ABM-NMD issues, and the importance of the Russian elections coming up in December, and again the presidential elections next year.
While were in Istanbul, the President also will meet with President Kocharian of Armenia, and Aliyev of Azerbaijan. He will express support for democracy in the wake of the tragic terrorist attack in Armenia a few weeks ago, and make clear our strong support for the peace process to resolve the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh, which has bedeviled those two countries now for too long.
We are one of the co-chairs of the OSCE effort to resolve that conflict, and in recent months the two leaders have made a courageous new effort to make progress towards resolving the conflict.
Their presence and that of other Caspian leaders also gives us a chance to encourage progress on something of profound importance that we've been working toward for some time, and that is an oil pipeline that will transport the Caspian Sea oil from Baku in Azerbaijan to Ceyhan in Turkey. This will diversify the international community's sources of energy, help the newly independent states of the region stand on their own feet, power Turkey's growth and provide a, I think, profoundly important corridor that is not only of economic importance, but of strategic importance, for these countries to the West.
We also expect to take advantage of the summit to meet with other leaders -- the President will meet with President Chirac, for example -- and to address the important issue of modernizing the CFE Treaty.
The summit continues through Friday, and late on Friday afternoon we will leave for Greece. I believe there's a state dinner on Friday evening, and then on Saturday the President will meet with the Greek President, Stephanopoulos -- no. (Laughter.)
Q: That's what happened to him. (Laughter.)
MR. BERGER: -- and Prime Minister Simitis. He will deliver a speech to the Greek people.
As you know, we moved the date of the Greek leg of the trip at the recommendation of the Greek government, who believed that a later date would be more conducive to a productive visit. There, undoubtedly, still will be demonstrations in Athens when we are there. There is a residue of feeling about the conflict in Kosovo among the Greek people -- I think 96 percent of which were opposed to NATO's engagement, although the government of Greece stood firmly with NATO in that effort. But if any country is a model for young democracies in the Balkans and expression of dissent, it is the birthplace of democracy, in Greece, and I suspect we will see some of that while we're there.
The President will have a chance to highlight that our relationship with Greece is far better than it was just a decade ago. Then, Greece was seen as the poorest country in the EEU; now, it is the wealthiest country in its region, it's a leader in stabilizing the Balkans, it's a dynamic economic partner. The President will urge the Greeks to look forward, not backward, and address key issues on our collective agenda, including relations with Turkey and Cyprus.
On Saturday night and Sunday, the President will be in Florence, Italy, for a conference on progressive governance in the 21st century, joined by five other prominent international leaders, Italian Prime Minister D'Alema, Prime Minister Blair, French Prime Minister Jospin, Chancellor Schroeder and President Cardozo of Brazil.
If it's Monday, we will be in Bulgaria. The President will meet in Sofia with President Stoyanov and Prime Minister Kostov, and address the people of Bulgaria.
Q: What happened to Sunday?
MR. BERGER: Sunday, we're going to be in Florence. Saturday and Sunday.
He will highlight in Bulgaria both the problems and the progress of the Balkans. Bulgaria reflects, in many ways, that dichotomy -- a crippling communist legacy for Bulgaria, a late but now quite vigorous start on reform, and under the Stoyanov government, a genuine commitment to multiethnic democracy and open markets, the beginning of economic stability, and strong support for NATO in its stand on Kosovo.
The President will reaffirm there -- and I also believe there will be discussion of this in the OSCE meeting in Istanbul -- the commitments we made in Sarajevo at the summit on Southeastern Europe, to help Bulgaria and the Southeast Europe states build security and prosperity on the road to European institutions.
In that respect, I'm happy to announce today that USTR is transmitting to the Congress the administration's Southeast Europe Trade Preference Act, which will authorize duty-free treatment for five years for imports from this region that are currently not eligible for the generalized system of preferences program that is global in scope. The products that would be covered under this that would not be covered under GSP would include iron and steel products, agricultural products, footwear, glassware, ceramics and others.
In some cases, that will amount to nearly 40 percent of their total exports to the United States. It's not a big part of our imports, but it's a very big part of their exports. The countries covered will include Albania, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, Macedonia, Romania, Slovenia -- that's Slovenia -- Kosovo, and Montenegro. It's a critical part of our strategy to integrate this region into the mainstream of Europe.
I'm also pleased that today, the President signed a proclamation that will significantly expand the visa sanctions we impose on those who support the Milosevic regime in Serbia -- the main impediment to a better future for Southeast Europe. The sanctions target those who are responsible for propping up the Milosevic dictatorship, and for the misery it has caused. As long as the people of Serbia are suffering, we want to make sure that Milosevic's cronies do not have privileges of traveling to the United States. As long as Milosevic remains the head of Serbia, Serbia will remain in its destructive, downward spiral. We will continue to support a democratic Serbia so that it can take its rightful place in a unified Europe, and I'm sure that will be the subject of substantial discussion in Istanbul.
Finally, on Tuesday we are going to Kosovo via Skopje, Macedonia. The President will meet with the Macedonian leadership briefly and then arrive in the U.S. sector in Kosovo where he will meet with local leaders in Kosovo, with the Commander of KFOR and the head of the U.N. Mission, Mr. Kushner. He will also speak to Kosovars -- during the day there he'll deliver a speech to Kosovars, and have a pre-Thanksgiving dinner with U.S. troops at Camp Bonsteel.
There has been a great deal of progress -- Ambassador Hill can talk more about this -- in Kosovo. Eight hundred thousand refugees are back, normal life is returning. Economic life is reviving; violence, still a problem, is down. Slowly but surely, new institutions are being built. And Albanians are increasingly looking to pragmatic leaders to take them into the future. But it is still a time of insecurity and fear for Kosovo Serbs, and as winter approaches, the task of rebuilding remains our priority.
The President will reaffirm our determination to finish that job and our commitment to help build a more tolerant and democratic Kosovo that redeems the cause for which the United States and NATO fought for 78 days earlier this year.
Why don't I let --
Q: Sandy, before you leave, can you answer just a couple of questions?
MR. BERGER: I'll come back.
ASSISTANT SECRETARY GROSSMAN: I'm the price you have to pay to get him. Thank you very much. Sandy just asked me if I would take two or three minutes just to put a little frame around what we're trying to do in Greece and Turkey. He very rightly referred to the President's speech at Georgetown the other day, where the focus was on how much the relationship between the United States and Greece and how much the relationship between the United States and Turkey matters to us.
And as we look back over the 50 years, as the President did and Sandy did in the beginning of his presentation, what you find, we think, in Greece and Turkey, is really a focus between the United States and these countries on security -- and that's really important. And also, these countries were part of something else -- they were part of the relationship with the Aegean, part of their relationship between Greece and Turkey, part of what we were doing with Cyprus.
What I think the President's trip is going to highlight is that all of these things remain absolutely vital -- our security relationship with these countries, how they react with one another, how the relationship in terms with the Aegean and Cyprus, but that also, this President has created with these countries very important bilateral relationships.
And with Greece, what we're seeking -- and I hope the President will be able to highlight -- is a 21st century agenda with the 21st century issues on it and toward the 21st century country. And what we want to do with Greece is focus in on the economic relationship.
As Sandy said, some years ago our bilateral relationship with Greece in the economic field was the second lowest of any country in the European Union. We want to increase that, and we're doing that both by helping private American companies export to Greece, to invest in Greece, we want to help modernize Greek forces so there are defense sales happening, and we want to focus in on the economic relationship with Greece.
Secondly, we want to work with Greece, as Sandy said, in the region -- what they're doing in the Balkans, what they're doing with us in Kosovo and Bosnia, and all of that is extremely important. And, third, we want to make sure that those issues on the bilateral relationship with Greece also include our concerns about terrorism and the work we are going to do with the Greek government at the request of the Greek government as Greece gets ready to host the Olympics in 2004.
In terms of Turkey, I think as the President said, this is a relationship that also matters hugely. With Turkey, we have produced an agenda that has to do very much with security cooperation, what we're doing together in Kosovo and in Iraq, human rights and democracy, and Sandy dealt with those issues. A great deal of regional cooperation with Turkey -- energy cooperation, trade, economic reform, and also again, the relationship with Greece and the relationship with Cyprus.
So, with both of these countries, we want to highlight the bilateral relationship, what we are doing with them, because the bilateral relationship with these countries is very much a part of the vision of trying to see this Europe whole, free, and at peace.
AMBASSADOR HILL: Thank you very much. Let me similarly just take a couple of minutes to discuss the last two stops on this trip -- that is, Bulgaria and Kosovo. This will be the first visit of a U.S. President to Bulgaria. Bulgaria is a country that has come a long way in its 10-year transition and, indeed, this visit will coincide exactly with that 10-year transition.
Bulgaria was often considered one of the most Stalinist of the East Bloc countries, and so the 10 years that have interceded have been quite a busy time for Bulgaria. It's been quite a difficult time for them; the economic restructuring that was required there, and is still required there, has been extremely problematic. Bulgaria has seen, in the last few years, a collapse of their currency, huge unemployment, and various other structural problems.
And yet, in the last couple of years, Bulgaria has begun to turn a very important corner in its transition. It has very strong leadership, a leadership that we have engaged in constant dialogue, not only discussing our bilateral relations, but also discussing the problems in the region. So it's an opportunity for the President to renew his meetings with the Bulgarian leadership, including President Stoyanov. It's also an opportunity to address the Bulgarian people, and that is the first time that has been done. And finally, it will be an opportunity to show what we are doing in the economic area. And so I would say in Bulgaria, one of our key efforts will be to show that we have turned a corner, and have begun the normal process of establishing and strengthening economic investment and trade relations.
In Kosovo, this will be the President's first trip to Kosovo. It's first of all an opportunity to meet with our troops there, only two days before Thanksgiving, and to talk with them, and also have a pre-Thanksgiving dinner with them. It's also a great opportunity to meet with the U.N. administration there, as well as the leadership of KFOR, to review the ongoing problems in Kosovo. And it will also be, I think, a very important occasion to meet directly with both Serb and Albanian leaders in Kosovo, to talk about their responsibilities for this very difficult transformation underway.
So this will be an occasion to review how we're doing in Kosovo, and the very difficult problems that lie ahead and the progress that we can make on those.
Q: When you say he's meeting with Serb and Albanian leaders in Kosovo -- would that be Rugova or would that be Thaci?
MR. HILL: It will include the Albanian leadership which has been working with the U.N., and that would include both Mr. Rugova -- Dr. Rugova -- and Mr. Thaci, as well as some Albanian leaders -- that is, those leaders who have been represented on the so-called transitional council that Mr. Kuchner has been working with.
Q: Was Rugova on the plane that went down today, the U.N. plane? There's a rumor to that effect.
AMBASSADOR HILL: We have heard absolutely no confirmation of that. Our understanding is that it was a U.N. flight, a U.N. food program flight from Rome to Pristina, and we are not aware of any Albanians on the flight. It seems to have been members of the NGO community and the UNMIK. I want to stress we're getting that informally, but that's our understanding at this point.
Q: Ambassador Hill, I take it that the President's visit to Kosovo wasn't cleared with authorities in Belgrade, and I'm just curious as to whether there's any reason ever to expect realistically for Kosovo to go back under Serb control, and what do you say would have to happen for that to take place?
AMBASSADOR HILL: Kosovo, under the terms of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1244, is under a U.N. administration. And so any coordination with visits to Kosovo are done with the U.N. And as for the overall status of Kosovo, I mean, what we are doing right now is not talking about the future status of Kosovo. What we are doing right now is building institutions, building democratic institutions, building economic institutions, building a market economy, and making sure that people are going to get through this difficult winter.
Q: Ambassador Hill, when President Clinton spoke at the refugee camp to Kosovars when he was in Macedonia last, he didn't explicitly call on them not to take revenge against the Serbs. He was a little more explicit when he was in Aviano, but he didn't say that when he was standing in front of the refugees. I'm wondering, since then there have been a lot of revenge killings -- I'm wondering if his message is going to be a little different when he goes to Kosovo this time.
AMBASSADOR HILL: Mara, I honestly think that that moment -- I don't know whether you were with us at that point -- was such a moving experience that the President didn't feel -- just didn't feel like giving a big speech. But it's certainly something he feels passionately about. He's spoken about it; I've spoken about it very firmly. I've said on a number of occasions, we didn't fight a conflict in Kosovo against the notion of ethnic cleansing only to condone ethnic killing to replace it.
So it is -- the security of the Serb population is very important. I think what we have to think about in terms of Kosovo is, in addition to all of the items that Ambassador Hill talked about, is also protection of minority rights, physical and otherwise. And I'm sure the President will address it, privately and publicly, as he has, of course, since he's been back.
Q: Sandy, what do you know about the earthquake in Turkey, and might it affect the trip?
MR. BERGER: I don't know much more than you know. I mean, I'm reading a wire copy here as I was sitting here. We know there was an earthquake, or an aftershock, somewhere between Ankara and Istanbul. The early reports indicated that the damage in Ankara and Istanbul were not substantial, but I would be very cautious to go beyond that.
Obviously, first of all, our hearts go out to the people of Turkey, who have seen this devastation of the earlier earthquake and a number of aftershocks, and now this action. But I have very little information. I have no reason to believe, at this point, that it will affect the trip. But obviously, that's something that we'll look at in light of further information.
Q: Can you talk about the bilateral relationship with Turkey? With the demise of the Soviet Union and the importance of the southern flank of NATO not being what it once was, can you talk about why Turkey is important to the United States?
MR. BERGER: Yes. I think, arguably, Turkey's relationship to the United States is more important now than it was in the Cold War -- certainly as important. Turkey, by reason of geography, by reason of demographics, by reason of religious diversity, will either be in the 21st century a bridge, a democratic bridge of stability between East and West, between the Islamic world and the non-Islamic world, or it will be a source of instability, of conflict, both with respect to its neighbors and the region.
The President has, from the very beginning, from the first term, felt that this relationship was extremely important. This is why, for example, he has supported so strongly the EU's providing candidacy to Turkey for membership, something which hopefully will happen, because he believes that we have an interest in anchoring Turkey firmly in the West and reinforcing the democratic, now 50-, 60-year course of Turkey, and of having Turkey a model of progressive, moderate, Islamic-Muslim leadership. So I think Turkey's importance to us is very fundamental.
Q: Sandy, on Chechnya, you spoke to Putin about two weeks ago; the President did last week. Is there any sign in the interim that they've been getting the message that there is any reduction of the indiscriminate attacks on civilians, or is that, in fact, increased?
MR. BERGER: I don't think there's clear evidence that there's been any substantial reduction. I think that it is our view that while we -- Russia certainly has a right and obligation to protect its territorial integrity and to fight terrorists, and there clearly is a terrorist dimension to this -- that if its means of doing so involve high levels of civilian casualties, high levels of refugees, that it is unlikely to succeed. And it is likely to diminish its standing in the international community. And that is a message we'll continue to deliver to Russia. And I suspect others will as well in Istanbul.
Q: What exactly is the terrorist dimension? I mean, they haven't provided any evidence to show that the Chechen terrorists, at least, were behind the apartment bombings in Moscow.
MR. BERGER: That issue is one I don't have enough information on, but there clearly are terrorist elements in Chechnya. There's no question about that.
But the question here is, what is an effective way of dealing with them? In our view -- sooner rather than later, we hope -- there needs to be a political dialogue that leads to some kind of a political resolution of this, that a purely military solution will come at great cost and not be durable.
Q: Sandy, you've been pressing that case to the Russians. Just two weeks ago, the President pressed that case with Prime Minister Putin. What makes you think that the message is going to be different, or that it's going to have a different response, in Istanbul?
MR. BERGER: I don't know whether it will. But I think it is something that we will -- Russia will come to Istanbul with 53 other countries present there. This is not just of concern to the United States; it's a concern of the Europeans, of the EU and others. And I think to the extent to which we can manifest our views to Russia, not only is the United States, but the other countries -- the extent to which they see that they are isolated on this in the international community, we hope that will have an influence on their decisions.
Q: You say the President will discuss the Russian election with Yeltsin at his meeting. What message will he have for President Yeltsin?
MR. BERGER: I think the message simply is that we believe these elections are extremely important, both the Duma election in December and the presidential election, then, in June; that we think it will be an extraordinary milestone for Russia to move from one democratically elected President to another -- the first time that will have ever happened in all of Russian history; and therefore we support that democratic process, and we support a process of free and fair elections in Russia.
Q: Sandy, can you talk about the bombings in Pakistan, whether you think it was a coordinated attack on American interests, and who do you think is behind it, bin Laden or-and his supporters?
MR. BERGER: We have very little information at this point, other than the fact that several bombs were exploded, or several explosive devices were detonated in Islamabad today. But at this point, we don't know who was responsible. It's something obviously that we're looking at very hard.
Q: -- against the U.S. embassy?
Q: Can I ask you about some developments with regard to Vieques? The President met with Secretary Cohen yesterday, and with the Navy officials and the Marine commandant. Does he now have enough information to make a decision about which way to go on that issue? Or does he need to talk first to the governor of Puerto Rico or other officials?
MR. BERGER: Well, this is obviously a very difficult problem. There is -- we have a strong interest in being able to deploy our forces abroad in a way that they are ready for whatever they might face, a way in which training is adequate. At the same time, the feelings and emotions of the people in Vieques and Puerto Rico are very strong on this. And finding a way to reconcile those two elements is not easy, but it's something that we're seeking to do.
Q: Can I just follow that, Sandy? Do you think it's something he can reach a decision on before he leaves for this trip, given the timetable of the Eisenhower training?
MR. BERGER: I don't know that there will be a solution before we leave for the trip, no.
Q: Back on Pakistan, is there any indication that U.S. interests were the target? And the Pakistani government seems to have pretty strong indications that bin Laden was behind it. Do we have similar indications, and how are we investigating it? Has the FBI been sent in?
MR. BERGER: I don't have an awful lot of information on Islamabad at this point, and I'm hesitant to speculate. Obviously, U.S. investigators will be part of the effort to determine what the source of cause of this is, but I think I'd rather not speculate, based on this point, very kind of desultory information.
Q: In Kosovo, will the President have words of encouragement for the Belgrade opposition leaders, any message?
MR. BERGER: I certainly hope so. Obviously, it is extraordinarily important for there to be a change in government in Belgrade. It is important not only to the people of Serbia, who are living very difficult circumstances, isolated from the world, but it's important for the region.
The integration of the region that we seek, the development of the region, both within itself and into Europe, is made much more difficult if you have to build around Serbia rather than doing it with a democratic Serbia.
I think in recent weeks, there's been encouraging movement by the democratic opposition leaders in coming together around a common agenda, which is to hold free and fair elections under international supervision, something we support, and we will continue to provide them our support, because we believe in what they're seeking to do.
Q: Mr. Berger, November 14th, the U.N. deadline for Taliban is around the corner, and they are saying that they will not ask bin Laden to leave the country, number one. Number two, as the Security Advisor, how do you advise the President to visit India alone or not, because since the President has been waiting for the last two years to visit India. But now there is a military next door in Pakistan, and now some officials are saying that, including Mr. Yaqub Khan who was here, that the President should not visit India alone, it would be a very dangerous game for the U.S. to play. Now he cannot visit military-ruled, military regime in Pakistan, so what do you advise him now?
MR. BERGER: Well, I wouldn't advise him from this podium, first of all. Obviously, the President has wanted to visit the region for some time, and he continues to want to do so. The coup in Islamabad complicates that situation, but I -- at this point, no decisions have been made.
Q: I'm sorry, just to follow up. I'm sorry. Can you advise him, or can he visit alone India only? Like President Jimmy Carter did --
THE VICE PRESIDENT: Can I advise him? Yes, that's what I'm paid to do. And what will I advise him? That's not what I'm paid to talk about.
Q: And about the U.N. resolution? I mean, the --
MR. BERGER: The U.N. resolution will go into effect on the 14th. The Taliban, for a whole range of reasons, is outside even the most
reasonable, or the most elastic, definition of acceptable international behavior. And we're glad that the international community is now about to embrace the sanctions that we imposed upon the Taliban unilaterally some weeks ago.
Q: What do you expect on Cyprus? And second, can the CFE, the revision of the CFE treaty, be ready for signature at the summit meeting?
MR. BERGER: On Cyprus, it is obviously a very important issue for us. We would -- ultimately, our objective here is to see talks between the parties under U.S. -- substantive talks between the parties -- under U.S. auspices -- under U.N. auspices, excuse me, not U.S. auspices.
And this is what we've been working towards now for some time. The President sent Secretary Albright's special representative on Cyprus -- Ambassador Al Moses has been in the region quite frequently in the past month. We've been engaged in serious discussions with all of those affected. We hope to make progress toward an ultimate objective of substantive talks between the parties under the auspices of the U.N. I don't know whether that will happen in this trip, or not.
And you asked me a second question about CFE. There continues to be unresolved issues in connection with CFE which our negotiators are working on. We would hope that we could complete a CFE treaty. There are substantial benefits to the United States from the first wholesale revision of the CFE agreement since 1990. And that was at a treaty that was written when there was a Warsaw bloc and NATO. In fact, NATO was smaller than the current NATO. And therefore, all of its limitations and its ceilings are all based upon an antiquated view of the world. We need to have a system now in which ceilings are based upon national limits, rather than bloc limits. We need to have stronger assurances for countries that they will have to agree to the stationing of forces on their land, on their territory.
What the new amendments will do also is to strengthen the verification regime and the transparency of forces that are stationed throughout Europe. So there are many benefits in this agreement if we can complete it. But, as I say, we're not there yet.
Q: Sandy, you have spoken of Turkey as a model of secular Islamic rule. And yet the State Department has been very critical of the --
MR. BERGER: I think what I said is, it can be either one or the other.
Q: On that point, precisely, the State Department's been very critical of a fairly egregious litany of human rights abuses in Turkey that seem to continue -- torture, murder, rounding up journalists, throwing them in jail. I'm wondering if you view Turkey as just another European country or is this the Turkey of the Midnight Express? (Laughter.)
Q: Say yes.
MR. BERGER: No, I'm not going to say yes. We have always been concerned about human rights issues in our discussions with Turkey -- many of the issues that you have described. And we certainly will discuss them with Prime Minister Ecevit, President Demirel, as we did when prime Minister Ecevit was here.
I think it's worth nothing, however, that there have been significant improvements since Prime Minister Ecevit was elected -- what became Prime Minister. There have been a number of laws that have been passed with respect to press freedom, with respect to democracy, with respect to minority rights, with respect to treatment of prisoners, and I think it is generally agreed that the situation is getting better. But it continues to be an issue that we want to discuss with Turkey so that it will continue to make progress on the path that it has been on for the past several months. Thank you.
THE PRESS: Thank you.

Bill Clinton,"November 12, 1999",Press Briefing by Joe Lockhart,"The Briefing Room
11:10 A.M. EST
MR. LOCKHART: Let me just say, since we didn't gaggle this morning, but I think you guys have a sense of the President's schedule. He'll have the meeting with President Wahid of Indonesia at about 11:45 a.m. There will be a pool spray at the top of that. Then we'll have the financial modernization bill signing.
I think significant in that speech is the President will be directing his staff, OMB, Treasury and others to look at ways to take the financial privacy part of that bill and go further. He does -- as we've said in our statements of administration policy and from here, we think there are important privacy protections in there, but they don't go far enough. So we will be working on some new proposals from the direction of the President on how we can improve privacy provisions in that bill.
Q: How about the CRA, Joe? Do you plan any initiatives to strengthen that?
MR. LOCKHART: No, I think we worked very closely with members and leaders on the Hill to make sure that CRA was kept intact and the protections were there; and that, importantly, companies with poor community investment records would not be able to take advantage of the new opportunities that this bill provides. So I think it was an important bottom line principle for us and one that we protected.
Q: Are you satisfied with the deal that was reached on --
MR. LOCKHART: Yes. I mean, obviously, as we move forward, if there are ways to improve it, we'll always look for ways to -- what's very clear from the debate that happened is how strong the President's commitment is to community banking and to investing in communities. But if there are ways to look at what we're doing and improve that, we're always open to ideas. But I think that this bill protects the President's commitment to CRA.
Q: Is this new legislation he's going to propose on privacy, or can this be done administratively?
MR. LOCKHART: That's precisely what we'll look at -- to see whether there are any things we can do administratively or whether it will have to be done legislatively.
Q: Joe, does the White House agree with Pakistan's assessment that bin Laden's group was behind this morning's rocket attack in Islamabad?
MR. LOCKHART: Let me say that, clearly, we condemn any kind of violence of this kind, but we are, from the early reporting, we're grateful that the injuries were kept to a minimum. It does not appear that any Americans were injured in these attacks. We don't know at this point who is responsible for these attacks. We will be continuing our efforts to gather as much information as we can. But at this point, we have come to no conclusion on responsibility.
Q: Are there any indications that it was bin Laden's group? Pakistan seems to be pretty firm about that.
MR. LOCKHART: Again, we have not made an assessment on who is responsible for these attacks at this point, and when we do, we'll let you know.
Q: You're going to make your own, or will you rely on what the Pakistanis are telling you, as well?
MR. LOCKHART: I think we will come to an assessment based on the information that we gather and that is provided to us.
Q: Joe, on the radio this morning I heard what was a sound bite from there, someone saying that this was sort of a way of sending a message. It wasn't meant to actually probably kill anyone or anything else, this was a way of trying to send a message, perhaps to the United States, with this deadline coming.
MR. LOCKHART: Listen, it's a barbaric way to send a message if that's what it is. And what is clear is our resolve in fighting terror around the world, and our resolve to continue a policy of dealing directly, through sanctions, with those who promote terror.
Q: Joe, are you satisfied or do you believe that these attacks were directed at U.S. targets?
MR. LOCKHART: Oh, I think -- we're looking at the information. Clearly there are international -- these went off in the vicinity of international organizations which include the U.S. So I don't know that you can be completely clear, given the proximity of many different kinds of organizations to where these things went off. But we're working on trying to understand the motivation and who's responsible for this.
Q: Joe, can you tell us the status of the embassy, the U.S. embassy there? Is it closing to the public, or do you know?
MR. LOCKHART: I'd refer you to the State Department on the exact. I know that they're looking at making sure that their security situation is intact. And they're doing everything they can to make sure that Americans working there are protected, and they were today.
Q: Joe, on WTO, Ambassador Barshefsky has reported no progress in three days of talks with the Chinese. Is that a negotiating position, or is that really a reflection that these talks are going nowhere?
MR. LOCKHART: No, it's a statement of fact. She's reporting that there's no significant progress at the end of the third day of the talks.
Q: There's always been the stance not to comment on the negotiations or characterize them as they're ongoing. We've heard that probably a dozen times from you. What's the point of characterizing them now?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, I don't think she's talking about the substance or the issues. They've come to the end of the third day. I expect them to come back to Washington tomorrow, China time, so they'll be back here sometime on the weekend. And she doesn't have progress or a breakthrough to report.
Q: Joe, can you give us an update on the U.N. arrears and the abortion issue and those negotiations?
MR. LOCKHART: Those discussions have been ongoing for some time. Clearly, we have an obligation to pay our dues, and our back dues to the United Nations, to continue our leadership around the world and to keep us from becoming put in the same category as countries like Iraq and Sudan, who the U.N. has dealt with quite harshly.
We don't believe that a side issue of international family planning should hold up U.N. dues. There is a faction of the hard right in Congress that has held this up for several years. We are working to try to find a solution that allows us to pay our dues, but also allows us to keep our commitments on international family planning.
Q: Would the Secretary of State be willing to reach out to abortion rights group if, indeed, you do decide it's necessary to give up this funding?
MR. LOCKHART: You'll have to ask the Secretary of State that. I don't have any information on that.
Q: But, Joe, on that point, is the U.S. position non-negotiable, or is the U.S. willing to compromise a little bit on this issue?
MR. LOCKHART: We are talking to the leaders on the Hill involved in this issue to find a way to pay our dues and accommodate their concerns. But I can't predict where that will go.
Q: Can I just get back to something you said a moment ago? Do you expect that Ambassador Barshefsky will come back from China tomorrow empty-handed?
MR. LOCKHART: I expect her to come back tomorrow. I don't know what will be in her bags, but --
Q: What's the next step?
Q: Is there a further meeting on that?
MR. LOCKHART: Not that I'm aware of.
Q: Beanie babies. (Laughter.)
MR. LOCKHART: I kind of walked into that one, didn't I? (Laughter.) Let the record note that there were a bunch of you who were thinking it, John said it first. (Laughter.)
Q: Joe, can you give us a comment on President Wahid's comment that he would be inclined to pardon his predecessor, President Soeharto?
MR. LOCKHART: I think from the United States government's point of view, it's very important that Indonesia take dealing with corruption seriously. It's important for their democracy and also for their economic future. As far as a particular judicial move on any one person, I think that that's an internal matter for their courts and for the President.
Q: To follow up, is this going to be one of the topics that they're discussing in this meeting, and what are some of the other things on the agenda?
MR. LOCKHART: Let me take a look here. I expect the primary focus of the meeting will be the President welcoming President Wahid and congratulating him on his election and Indonesia and the remarkable transformation to democracy. I think we recognize the many challenges he has in consolidating the democracy and reviving the economy. We believe very strongly, the United States does, in a strong and prosperous Indonesia and we want to work with them in any way we can to promote that.
Q: Does the U.S. have any viewpoint on the separatist movements, for instance, in Aceh and Irian Jaya in regards to Indonesia? Because the separatist movements have gained steam after East Timor.
MR. LOCKHART: Well, we believe that East Timor, in itself, is a unique case, with a colonial history that's unique to East Timor. But I think we will express support for President Wahid's efforts to achieve a peaceful political settlement in Aceh. And on the issue of whether there ought to be a referendum like there was in East Timor, that's something for the Indonesians.
Q: Do you have a fear that Indonesia may become Balkanized with these provinces trying to split off from the center?
MR. LOCKHART: I think it's -- we believe it's important that we recognize the moves they've made towards democracy and we'll be working with them to promote and strengthen democracy within the ground. Beyond that, I don't have anything else.
Q: Joe, on Medicare -- health community announced an agreement a few days ago, costing about $12 billion over five years. Where is that money coming from?
MR. LOCKHART: I think we've come to some agreement and conclusion on what we need to do as far as the give-backs, but there is some work that remains on how that gets paid for. So that work is ongoing.
Q: Joe, on the budget, do you pick Jack Lew to be talking to any lawmakers today?
MR. LOCKHART: I think Jack will do most of his talking by the phone today. A lot of members are back home for Veterans Day celebrations. I think some of the leaders and appropriators are here in Washington, but I think he'll confine himself to talking on the phone today. There are a number of outstanding issues from U.N. arrears to Interior and other particulars on bills that still need to be worked out. I think it's important that we use the time between now and the middle of next week, when Congress comes back, to consolidate the important agreements we've made, and to guard against any sort of back-slipping on these agreements.
I think, as you saw in the paper today, this is kind of crunch time for lobbyists all looking for the special provision, and people trying to sneak things in at the last minute. It's very important that we stick to the agreements, get the business of the people done, and set ourselves up so we're in a position, by the middle of next week, to get this thing done.
Q: What's the problem on the Interior bill at this point?
MR. LOCKHART: There's a number of anti-environmental riders that remain. We have made it very clear that they're unacceptable. We still have some more work to do to try to fix that problem.
Q: Is Byrd's problem addressed -- Senator Byrd's problem?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, I mean, his suggestion of finding a way to legislate what the court is doing now is something that we don't support.
Q: But, I mean, is this going to remain as part of the debate over the Interior bill?
MR. LOCKHART: That's a question you need to put to the Senator.
Q: Joe, there is a report that one of the pilots of the EgyptAir plane expressed concern to his family prior to the flight. Does the White House know anything about that? And are you troubled by the report at all?
MR. LOCKHART: I'm not familiar with the report, so -- I hadn't heard it, so it's hard to express any reaction, beyond saying that the people who are doing the investigation have reached no conclusions about what the cause of the flight is. They are looking for the voice recorder now. They've got the data recorder, as you know, and the federal investigators are looking at all possibilities with nothing ruled in or nothing ruled out.
Q: Joe, Russia is now apparently considering flying nuclear-capable bombers to Cuba and Vietnam early next year.
MR. LOCKHART: I've seen the report, but I have nothing to indicate whether that report is accurate or not.
Q: Would that be a provocation or --
MR. LOCKHART: That's a hypothetical based on a report that may not be correct, so I'm not going to answer that.
Q: Joe, on Chechnya, Russian Defense Minister Sergeyev, in criticizing the United States -- and let me read the quote here, so I get it exactly right -- said ""it is in the national interest of the United States that a guided armed conflict smolder constantly in the territory of the North Caucasus region."" Is that a fair characterization of this administration's policy?
MR. LOCKHART: No, it's a misguided characterization of this administration's policy on Chechnya. The President has spoken to Prime Minister Putin. President Yeltsin will continue those conversations. They know quite well what our position is and what our interest in this case is.
Q: Joe, are there any reaction to the fact that tobacco lawyers are suing Microsoft, and is it the government's case, as evidenced in that?
MR. LOCKHART: I saw a newspaper report on that. I have no comment on that, one way or the other, and no knowledge of it one way or the other.
Q: It's being reported that Republicans are still considering some across-the-board spending cuts, although to a much smaller scale. Is the administration at all open to that idea? If not, first of all, are they open to any --
MR. LOCKHART: We've made pretty clear that we find their proposal as is now unacceptable. I don't know that they've made any new proposal; I haven't heard or seen anything about that. But we believe that budgeting is about making choices, making priorities, and doing cuts in an across-the-board fashion is the wrong way to go about it.
Q: So you're not ruling that out?
MR. LOCKHART: I don't know what a new proposal is. The proposal that's on the table we've issued a veto threat on. So that's pretty clear.
Q: That's the 1 percent?
MR. LOCKHART: Yes.
Q: But the discussion is for something half that amount.
MR. LOCKHART: Listen, I don't know where that discussion stands, but I haven't seen a proposal like that, so I'm not --
Q: On principle, is the administration against any --
MR. LOCKHART: On principle, the administration believes that across-the-board cuts are the wrong way to go about budgeting; that governing and budgeting is about making tough choices and setting priorities and making those choices, not about cutting across the board.
Q: But if you don't go along with that and neither side is willing to support dipping into Social Security, then isn't the only thing left creative accounting techniques?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, again, we've spoken at length on that subject from here. I'm not aware of any new proposals, so I'm not going to get into hypotheticals.
Q: On the issue of pay-fors, did the administration give a new offer today, and how far apart are the two sides on that?
MR. LOCKHART: I'm not going to get into the detail of pay-fors, only that we've made clear that the spending needs to be paid for. Let's remember where this started. We put forward a budget that made critical investments in our priorities; it was fully paid for and protected Social Security. They put forward an $800 billion tax cut that wasn't paid for. We've come a long way since that point. There is still some more work to do, but we're going to work with them in a constructive way to make sure that we pay for our spending.
Q: Does this administration agree that Arafat's comments yesterday were part of that inflammatory rhetoric that the President had warned the Palestinians and Israel against using?
MR. LOCKHART: I think the remarks that were made yesterday were inconsistent with the spirit of the agreement the leaders made to provide for a constructive and positive atmosphere to move forward in this peace process.
Q: Did the Palestinians have a legitimate beef that years of teargas use might have led to some sort of medical problems?
MR. LOCKHART: I'm not aware of any basis for those allegations.
Q: Did the administration convey that to the Palestinian leader, what you just said?
MR. LOCKHART: I think you can assume that discussions have gone on with all the parties, as they do constantly.
Q: Does the budget, as it's emerging, tap the Social Security surplus, in the administration's view? Does the budget use the Social Security surplus?
MR. LOCKHART: We're not through with this process. We're going to move forward over the next few days, and work very closely with the leadership on both sides to pay for the spending. And that is our goal.
Q: Joe, back to WTO. Will you be making additional attempts to reach an agreement before the Seattle talks?
MR. LOCKHART: Listen, we've made it very clear publicly and privately that we believe that China ascending into WTO is very good for American business, very good for American families. There was a natural reason to try to do this in the context of the Seattle WTO meeting. But there's no artificial deadline here. This will be a good deal for Americans, whenever we can get a commercially viable agreement with China.
If you remember, at the root of this is a very open U.S. market to China, and a quite closed market for U.S. goods in China. So we think that we're going to continue working, because it is the right thing for this country. And there's no artificial deadline here on when that gets done, beyond --
Q: But is it possible to do it before --
MR. LOCKHART: You know, again, it's --
Q: You haven't given up?
MR. LOCKHART: I don't think we ever give up on something so important. We're not tied to a particular calendar. We want a good deal, and we will get a deal when both sides are ready to make it.
Q: When is Ambassador Barshefsky scheduled to leave?
MR. LOCKHART: Sometime tomorrow.
Q: Has she reported -- since her statements that there's been no progress, has there been any progress made? (Laughter.)
MR. LOCKHART: I think they've been sleeping. So unless they're all having good dreams, I don't think there has been any progress.
Q: I know we're going to get a more detailed briefing later, but could you lay out the rationale for the President's upcoming trip, what he hopes to accomplish?
MR. LOCKHART: You will, and I will spare you a detailed briefing of this, because Mr. Berger will be down here later in the day. But this trip will be about deepening our ties of economic, diplomatic national security cooperation with important allies. We have an important OSCE meeting in Turkey. We have an important bilateral relationship with Turkey and Greece. There are important issues of regional security that will be discussed. And then we will also travel to Italy for a Third Way, an important conference on an emerging political philosophy that you see both here in the United States and in Europe. And then important stops in Bulgaria to celebrate what they've done in 10 years as far as moving and enriching their democracy and freedom; and Kosovo, which has been, obviously, something much more prominent this year as far as reversing the kind of ethnic cleansing that has ripped part of Europe apart for much of this decade.
Q: Joe, this story hit just before the briefing. Do you have anything on that U.N. plane that's gone missing near Kosovo?
MR. LOCKHART: I've seen the reports, but I have no independent information on the whereabouts of that plane.
Q: Joe, the Indonesian President come here for help and -- U.S. interest to respond. And that response would include the resumption of military assistance. Do you think President Clinton, after meeting with Abdurrahman Wahid, will reconsider his position to suspend military aid to Indonesia?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, I think, as a general matter, the United States is prepared to resume military ties with Indonesia. But the pace and scope of that resumption will depend on the progress of military reform, accountability, as well as the continued cooperation with the U.N. in the context of both East and West Timor.
Q: The question is that Pakistan's military Special Envoy was here, Mr. Yaqub Khan. And he met several top officials and also he said that President Clinton should not visit India, it will be very dangerous game the U.S. will play. At the same time, Indians are saying that U.S. is always to promote democracies and worst democracy has been ignored so far, as President's visit to Europe tomorrow. So he should -- several congressman called on the President he should visit India, not to wait for the government in Pakistan.
MR. LOCKHART: I have no scheduling announcements.
Q: I mean, is he ready to visit only India if there is no -- government in Pakistan?
MR. LOCKHART: I have no scheduling announcements for future travel.
Q: Can the President visit Pakistan unless there is a duly democratically elected government there?
MR. LOCKHART: I have no scheduling announcements.
Q: No, but that's not a scheduling question, that's a policy question.
MR. LOCKHART: The President has indicated that he'd like to travel to South Asia. He would like to visit these areas, but there are things that need to happen before a trip like that would be viable. And when the conditions are right, we'll let you know.
Q: What are the things? What things?
MR. LOCKHART: There are a number of things on the issues of nonproliferation, that we talked about last year in the wake of the testing in India and Pakistan. And there are number of other issues. I'm not going to get into a menu here. The governments, we have talked directly with the governments. I think they know what our feelings are. And when we're ready to announce a trip, we'll announce it.
Q: Has there been a decision on whether the President will go to Panama?
MR. LOCKHART: No. We've made no decision on the delegation. There will be a high-level delegation representing the U.S. government. And when that's ready, we'll put it out.
Q: Joe, do you have any comments on Yaqub Khan's statement that it will be a very dangerous game, visiting --
MR. LOCKHART: I commented on that yesterday. I refer you to my transcript. I can't quite remember all the way back to yesterday.
THE PRESS: Thank you.

Bill Clinton,"November 15, 1999",Remarks Following Discussions With President Suleyman Demirel of Turkey and an Exchange With Reporters in Ankara,"President Demirel. Distinguished members of the press, I would like to welcome once again in your presence, the President of the United States, my dear friend Bill Clinton. Mr. Clinton is in our country for a 5-day visit.
Taking this opportunity, I would like to, in Mr. Clinton's person, express our thanks to the American people for the support and solidarity they have shown during the disasters that affected our country, one after another, in recent months.
The Republic of Turkey and the United States of America work together for peace, stability, and prosperity on a vast geography which extends from the Balkans to the Caucasus, central Asia to the Middle East, Europe to the Black Sea, Caspian, and the Mediterranean Basin.
Earlier today we had an extensive exchange of views and opinions as two strategic partners. We discussed our contribution to regional peace, stability, and prosperity. We also reviewed areas where we can improve cooperation. We were pleased to note that both of us had the determination to evaluate new and broader avenues of cooperation between our countries.
We explained to the President our activities in the areas of economy, trade, and energy, and the importance we place on cooperation with the EU in this context. We also discussed defense cooperation and regional security issues. We evaluated our joint projects together. And we explored new possibilities for deepening our relations even further.
And we listened to the views of the President of the United States regarding the opinion and attitude of the United States on these subjects. President Clinton shares our view that it's very important for Turkey—as a country where democracy, Islam, and secularism are proven to coexist—to become an EU member in order to realize the project of a pluralist, democratic Europe with rich diversity.
In light of these views, we reviewed Turkey's relations with the European Union on the eve of the Helsinki summit. We explained once again to the President the assessment of the Turkish Republic regarding the European Union. We also expressed Turkey's contractual rights for EU membership. And we stressed our expectation from the European Union to focus on the proper perspective on this matter this time.
President Clinton has confirmed continued support of the U.S. for Turkey's membership to the EU. I can say that the meetings between two friends and allies that have strong bonds were beneficial and productive and that we were able to review common areas of interest, attention, and action that are included in the broad spectrum of the Turkish-American strategic partnership.
Our friendship with the United States is an important guarantee for the success for our common goals and ideals. This friendship will be fruitful in the future, and joint efforts by the United States and Turkey will bring further peace, stability, and prosperity to a vast geography.
I would like to welcome Mr. Clinton once again and wish him a good time in Turkey. Thank you all.
President Clinton. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I would like to thank you, the Prime Minister, and the members of the Turkish Government for your warm welcome here today, and reiterate the profound sympathies of the American people with the people of Turkey as a result of these two earthquakes.
The President has summarized our meeting quite well, and so I will just briefly add a couple of points. We spoke about the coming OSCE meeting, which Turkey will host. It is fitting that Turkey would be the host in this final year of the 20th century, when the agenda for Europe is to build a Europe that for the first time in history is undivided, democratic, and at peace. For Turkey is the key to meeting all the challenges that remained of that vision of Europe: the challenge of integrating Russia, of stabilizing the Balkans, of bringing a real peace to the Aegean and Cyprus, of bridging the gulf between the West and the Islamic world. In these areas and more, Turkey and the United States should be partners.
In that regard, I thank the President and the Prime Minister for the principled stand Turkey took in Kosovo and for Turkey's leadership today in bringing peace and prosperity to the Balkans.
We also had a very good conversation about the hopeful progress in cooperation between Turkey and Greece, an issue of profound importance to the United States because of our friendship with both nations and because of our strong support for Turkey's full partnership in the European Union. I expressed my hope that the coming talks on Cyprus will bring us closer to lasting peace with real security for all Cypriots and an end to the island's division.
We discussed the importance of continuing to integrate Russia with Europe as a strong, stable, democratic nation, and our shared concern that the mounting civilian casualties in Chechnya will hinder that goal.
We talked about energy security in the Caspian, and I reaffirmed America's commitment to making the Baku-Ceyhan and the trans-Caspian pipelines commercial realities, and my appreciation for the leadership of President Demirel and others toward that goal.
Finally, we discussed Turkey's progress in deepening its democracy and strengthening human rights. There has been impressive momentum in the last few years, and I hope there will be continued progress, especially in the area of freedom of expression.
In closing, Mr. President, I want to thank you for your friendship, for your commitment to our alliance. And I want to once again reaffirm my personal strong support for Turkey's European Union candidacy as it moves forward in all the areas that we have discussed today.
Thank you very much.
China-U.S. Agreement on World Trade Organization Accession
Q. Mr. President, on the WTO deal that you announced today, did China go beyond the concessions that it offered in April? And if so, could you say where and how far? And does this mean that China will be able to have an active role in the WTO talks in Seattle?
President Clinton. The answer to the first question is that we—I think the fair answer is that we finished a lot of the matters which were left unresolved when we were meeting in the springtime in Washington. I don't think it's fair to the Chinese or to the United States to give the inference that either one made massive new concessions.
I think that there were matters that were still outstanding that we were able to resolve and work through, and I'm very grateful, frankly, for the leadership of Ambassador Barshefsky and Mr. Sperling on our side and for all those on the Chinese side. I think this is a good agreement for China and for America and for the world. I think that all of us benefit when the most populous nation in the world is now going to be part of a rule-based system that will bring shared prosperity.
The answer to your second question—the short answer to your second question is I don't know. That is, I honestly don't know how this changes the specific formal role that China might play at Seattle. But as I'm sure you know, all the developing nations have been taking various positions on these issues. And I would certainly hope that the conclusion of this agreement between ourselves and China will lead to the rapid accession of China to the WTO and would lead the Chinese to urge other developing countries to take the same sort of comprehensive approach to their participation in the world economic system, because I think that will bring the quickest benefits to them and to the rest of the world.
Allegations of Repression and Torture in Turkey
Q. A question for both of you, please. Mr. President, what do you say to allegations of repression and torture in your country? And President Clinton, do you believe these allegations; are they a serious impediment to Turkish-American relations? And I speak now partly of the Kurds, but also other dissident groups.
President Demirel. It is impossible to say that there is no torture in Turkey; there is torture. But torture is not state policy. Torture is a crime. And whoever commits this crime, no matter who that person may be, that person is investigated and is penalized accordingly. And I can say that we are doing everything we can to make sure that there is no torture.
President Clinton. Let me, in response to your question, say that we believe that there has been a renewed and clear determination of the Turkish Government to take a stand against torture and to generally increase protection of human rights. There are some non-torture areas that we hope there will continue to be progress in, like freedom of expression. But President Demirel has faithfully stated, I think, the policy of the Turkish Government. And we are encouraged that the human rights issue is moving in the right direction in this nation.
Turkey-U.S. Relations
Q. Mr. Prime Minister, I would like to ask, have you observed a rapid development in the Turkish-American relationship, especially in the last years? Can you briefly describe the current status of the Turkish-American relations from the point of view of America?
President Clinton. Well, I would say from the point of view of America, they are very good. And I could give you some specific examples: one, our partnership in the Balkans, first in Bosnia and then in Kosovo, to stand up for human rights; two, our commitment to energy security in the region, and the support of the pipelines projects I mentioned earlier; three, the improvement in relationships between Turkey and Greece, something which has always been a little bit of a limitation on our partnership, because of our ties to both countries; and four, the economic and political reforms undertaken by Turkey in the last year and several months have been very impressive to us.
So, for all these reasons, I would say that the state of our partnership is strong, and I just want the United States to be in a position to give more economic assistance and more political support as we move toward our shared objectives.
Turkey and the European Union
Q. Mr. President, could you please tell us how determined you will continue to be in supporting Turkey's efforts with EU?
President Clinton. Excuse me. Did you ask me how determined am I to do that, or in what ways will I do that, or both?
Well, let me say first of all, I am very determined to support Turkish membership in the EU for a very good reason. I think if you— any of you, including my American colleagues here—if you were to go home tonight and make a list of the big problems you think the world could face in the next 10 or 20 years, every one of them would be strengthened if Turkey were a full partner in a Europe that respected religious and cultural diversity and shared devotion to democracy and human rights.
I might say that's one of the reasons I am so pleased by the recent improvement in relationships between Turkey and Greece and why I think it's so important to continue to make progress there, because the difficulties between the two nations are small when compared to the benefits of cooperation and European integration, both to Turkey and to Greece.
As to how I intend to express my support, I will continue to talk to the leaders of Europe. I take every opportunity that I have to have this discussion. I feel very strongly that one of the four or five key questions to the future of this whole part of the world is whether Turkey is a full partner with the European Union. So I will continue to advocate it.
President Demirel. Thank you.
President Clinton. Thank you very much.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-following-discussions-with-president-suleyman-demirel-turkey-and-exchange-with
Bill Clinton,"November 15, 1999",Press Briefing by National Security Advisor Sandy Berger,"6:15 P.M. (L)
MR. LOCKHART: Good evening, everyone. Let me give you a little fill on what the next hour will bring for you, for your pleasure.
Mr. Samuel Berger, the President's National Security Advisor, will make a brief statement and take a couple questions from you. And then we'll have a read out of the day from senior administration officials.
At about 7:00 p.m. or so I expect the Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, to be here. She'll be here to talk about, among other things, the U.N., the U.N. arrears, the budget issues that we've been working on in Washington.
So let's start with Sandy.
MR. BERGER: Good evening. I am very pleased that a number of critical foreign policy initiatives that we had been working on -- in some cases, for many years -- have all come together today. This has truly been an important day for American foreign policy.
First, as you know, after several years of negotiation, the United States and China reached an agreement with respect to Chinese accession to the World Trade Organization. It's a far-reaching agreement. It's an agreement that is good for the United States; we believe it's good for China; I believe it's important for the world as China becomes a part of a rules-based system of trade and an agreement that I believe will strengthen the U.S.-China relationship considerably.
Second, as you know, last night the parties in Cyprus agreed to the invitation of the Secretary General to attend proximity talks in New York, starting on December 3rd, to prepare the foundation for meaningful negotiations leading toward a comprehensive settlement.
Third, we've just heard from George Mitchell, who spoke to the President, that there has been progress on Northern Ireland. He has issued his interim report, in which he expresses increasing confidence that a way forward -- there is a way forward to implement the Good Friday agreement. And Mr. Mitchell, as well as the parties, deserve a great deal of credit for their persistence and courage.
Fourth, as Joe indicated, there has been progress on the issue of U.N. arrears and debt relief. I'm going to leave that for Secretary Albright to discuss in greater detail.
And fifth, I believe that this has been a very good day for U.S.-Turkey relations. I believe the President's first day here started on a very sound footing with his meetings with President Demirel, Prime Minister Ecevit, his address to the Parliament, which I think was very well received, and his strong message to the Turkish people.
So all in all, this has been, I think, a very, very important day for us. I know the President is very pleased with these developments; and, obviously, much more work lies ahead of us on each of them. But I think there's been a great leap forward, to coin a phrase, I guess, on a number of these issues today.
Q: Sandy, on the trade agreement, what did you get in this agreement that you didn't have last April?
MR. BERGER: I'll answer you generally, but I know that Ambassador Barshefsky and Mr. Sperling have briefed rather extensively in Beijing, and obviously in greater detail.
But there are about five or six areas that were unresolved or not satisfactorily resolved in April, which we now believe are satisfactorily resolved. One relates to import surge mechanisms; that is, what happens if there is a large increase in imports in a particular product; the anti-dumping protocols, which are very important to us in terms of applying our non-market methodology with respect to Chinese products; progress in the area of motion pictures, Internet access, satellites, auto financing, securities and a dialogue on capital markets.
These are all areas that were not satisfactorily resolved in April, and we believe have now been resolved. And, overall, we believe this is a very good agreement; we believe it's a win-win agreement for both China and for the United States. Obviously, it substantially opens access to the largest market in the world.
Q: What did China get that they didn't have last April?
MR. BERGER: Again, I'm not going to get into the specifics of balancing this and balancing that. I think, overall, this is a package which, obviously, we felt, we feel is very much in our interest and obviously the Chinese believe that, as well -- I'll let them speak for themselves.
Q: Sandy, you said that you were going to let Secretary Albright talk about the U.N. agreement, but can you give us any -- is there an agreement now?
MR. BERGER: I'd rather let her speak, she'll be here. I know it's only 45 minutes and you're anxious, but --
Q: Are you willing to say whether there is an agreement or what the President gave up on --
MR. BERGER: No, I'm going to leave that subject for her. It's something she's been working on for six years.
Q: Mr. Berger, I know the goal was always that China would enter on a commercially viable basis. Can you say to what extent that has happened as a result of this agreement? And, two, can you put this in the context of U.S.-China relations more broadly, which were really in the basement just a few months ago?
MR. BERGER: Well, I think the answer to the first question is this clearly is a deal which we believe is a commercially smart deal for the United States. We believe this will increase American jobs; we believe this will increase the access of American companies across a broad spectrum of products to the Chinese market. And we believe the protections we have on the import side, with some of the things that I've talked about in terms of import surge mechanisms and anti-dumping, will protect American industries from unfair or inordinate import surges from China.
So I think this is a very strong deal on a commercial basis. Obviously, each industry will look at this; each group -- labor and business -- will look at it in terms of their own particular industry. But I feel quite confident that this will have broad support across a broad range of industries and both among Republicans and Democrats.
In terms of our relations with China, I think this is a -- first of all, obviously, the threshold criteria for us reaching an agreement is a commercially viable agreement. That is, is this an agreement that's a good agreement on the merits? And we believe that this is a very good agreement on the merits. But, beyond that, it is unquestionably an important step forward in terms of our relationship.
First of all, I think it's very important that China now will -- assuming that it reaches agreements with the other countries, EU and others, with whom it has not yet completed its bilateral agreements, and enters the WTO -- it will become part of a global rule of law with respect to all of the issues involved here. It will open its markets, and therefore open its country, even more to the outside world.
And perhaps most importantly, this reinforces the momentum towards internal reform that has been going on in China. In order for China to have made this decision to open its markets to competition, it's going to have to move forward on its internal reforms to make its industries competitive. All of that will make China, I believe, a more open and hopefully more pluralistic, ultimately, place.
In terms of our bilateral relationship, I think this brings our bilateral relationship to a very, very strong level.
Q: -- on Taiwan and arms control, Sandy? Does this offer any opportunities there?
MR. BERGER: No, this agreement is a trade agreement. It does not deal with issues of arms control or issues of Taiwan. Taiwan also, separately, has been negotiating for accession to the WTO. It is very far along. And I suspect that China's accession will help Taiwan in the process of accession with a number of countries that have seen those two as related to one another.
Q: Could you please clarify Congress's role now with regard to the WTO agreement? I know that Congress doesn't determine whether or not China joins the WTO, but what is Congress's role regarding the U.S. trade pact with China?
MR. BERGER: Basically, two -- well, the principal role of the Congress is with respect to the granting of permanent national -- permanent MFN, essentially, to China. That has to be done by congressional statute, permanent NTR. I expect that we will submit that proposal to Congress sometime early next year, and I hope that it will have broad support. That will obviously be an opportunity for the Congress to express itself.
If any of these provisions in this agreement -- and I'm not sufficiently familiar with the specific details to know the answer to this -- require changes in U.S. law, obviously, that would require congressional action. But, generally, an accession agreement does not require congressional approval, per se.
Q: So if Congress doesn't agree to permanent normal trade relations, does the rest of the deal collapse?
MR. BERGER: Well, I don't want to assume that. I believe that we will move ahead on -- China will move ahead with other countries now, and hopefully in completing its bilateral agreements with the EU and other countries, and I would assume it would want to move fairly rapidly toward accession. And we will move forward with seeking permanent MFN.
And, again, I believe that when Congress has an opportunity to study the terms of this, recognize the tremendous benefits to American industry and American workers around the country, and the protections that we obtained for import-sensitive industries in this agreement, that there will be broad support for it.
Q: But just to clarify, is it required?
MR. BERGER: Is what required?
Q: Does China -- do you have to have both for all of this to come together?
MR. BERGER: We have said to China that we will seek -- we will make a strong effort to obtain permanent NTR with -- China knows our system very well. They know that Congress has a mind of its own and is an independent branch of government and we have to work with Congress to get that approval. They understand that.
Q: Could you discuss arms sales to Turkey? In particular, sale of attack helicopters?
MR. BERGER: I will let the senior administration officials talk specifically more about the meetings. The issue came up only -- it came up in the context of President Demirel making a number of -- a statement about a number of areas in which the United States could be of continuing assistance to Turkey, one of which related to military-to-military cooperation. But it was not specific.
Q: Is China going to be able to take part in the Seattle round of WTO talks?
MR. BERGER: Well, I believe at the very least, China will be there as an observer. And whether it is there as a member of the WTO obviously depends upon what happens with respect to the other bilateral agreements that it needs to strike.
Q: Did -- discuss the Aegean issue, and to which effect?
MR. BERGER: I'm sorry, the last part of your question?
Q: The Aegean issue, and to which effect?
MR. BERGER: To what effect?
Q: Yes, sir.
MR. BERGER: There was a great deal of discussion of U.S.-Greek relations in general, the Aegean, Cyprus. I think it was in the context, basically, of the President welcoming the steps that have been taken by the government of Turkey and the government of Greece, actually preceding the earthquake and then, perhaps, to some degree, intensified by the earthquake, towards some greater degree of reconciliation.
The President said he thought that was very important. He encouraged it. He hoped there would be further steps in that direction. He thought that Greece and Turkey, as true allies -- they're certainly our allies in a NATO sense, but as true allies -- over the next 25 years could do far more for their people and their country than as countries with a continuing antagonism. So the President very much encouraged the process of confidence-building measures and other steps that would build the greater degree of contact between the two countries and the two peoples.
Q: Sandy, assuming Secretary Albright has good news later -- and we won't get into that, one way or the other -- assuming she does, have the budgetary issues affecting foreign policy now been pretty much resolved? And maybe, after you finish, maybe Joe would just give us an update on where we think we are in the budget process right now.
MR. BERGER: Well, I think we've made a lot of progress, John. I think that, from where we were a month ago, the foreign operations bill, which was roughly $3-plus billion below what we needed, when you include Wye, was plussed up to include all the Wye money, which is extremely important towards the peace process, and nearly $800 million in other programs. So not everything we asked for, but a significant closure of the gap.
On the Commerce, State and Justice bill, again, there have been significant add-backs to that bill with respect to peacekeeping, for example, where there are missions now in East Timor and Sierra Leone, where there's not one American -- well, in Timor, we have a few American soldiers, but none in Sierra Leone. This is burden-sharing. Other countries are on the ground doing the peacekeeping, but we have to help pay our share of the cost, and Congress has added a significant amount, but not all of that money back.
The two remaining issues that are of importance to us in the foreign policy area, obviously, are U.N. arrears and the debt initiative that the President announced in Cologne, which would enable us, both bilaterally and multilaterally, to substantially increase debt relief for the poorest countries, but those who are engaged in a process of reform.
Those are two very important, outstanding issues. As I say, I think some progress has been made, and I'll let Secretary Albright amplify on that.
Q: Mr. Berger, there was some tough talk coming today from the Russians, saying that they will resist any outside interference on Chechnya, which presumably includes any advice from the United States. Do you have any sense that they are going to listen to Mr. Clinton's advice or the advice of anyone else, and if they don't what would happen?
MR. BERGER: I think that there is -- first of all, it's certainly not, I think, anybody's intention to intervene in a military way in the situation in Chechnya, which is part of the Russian Federation. I think there's great concern on the part of the United States and the Europeans and others as to the level of civilian casualties, and the number of refugees that are being created by the course of action that the Russian government is on.
And I know this will be discussed when the Russians are here, and I hope that the wide diversity of countries that have these concerns and apprehensions will register. These are -- many of these countries, including the United States, are friends of Russia. Our concern is not in any way to weaken Russia. Indeed, that's exactly what we don't want to happen. But as a friend of Russia, we believe the course that it's on now is likely to be counterproductive.
Q: Are you still expecting Yeltsin -- are you still expecting Yeltsin to come to Istanbul? Apparently the Russians are not saying anything about his plans yet.
MR. BERGER: There was an earlier statement that indicated that he would come. I have not seen anything that either contradicted that or reaffirmed it.
Q: Along those same lines, President Clinton said that Russia's action in Chechnya may hinder its integration with the West. Can you amplify a little bit on what that meant?
MR. BERGER: Where did he say that?
Q: In one of his speeches today.
MR. BERGER: I don't think you quoted it exactly right. I think that what the President said was that -- obviously, to the extent that the international community is concerned about what is happening in Chechnya, it makes it more difficult for governments to provide Russia the kind of support that Russia needs. I don't think -- I think that's simply a fact.
But, you know, the support we are providing for Russia now, say bilaterally, is, number one, for reducing their nuclear weapons and helping them to do a better job of containing, storing their nuclear materials; and, two, money that goes not to Moscow, but goes to democracy programs around the country. It would not make sense for us to affect that money. Nor would it make sense for us to affect the IMF money, assuming the economic and transparency criteria are met, because that goes to the very stability of Russia.
So I think that you will hear or see, in Istanbul -- which has a lot of other issues on the agenda, I would point out -- a rather general expression of views to either President Yeltsin or Prime Minister Putin, that this course is not a wise one.
MR. LOCKHART: Thanks, Sandy. John, did you want to do something before I bring them up?
Q: Budget update --
MR. LOCKHART: Yes, I think they're still working on a number of fronts, including on the Interior bill, on some of the environmental riders that have been so troublesome to the administration. That work is incomplete. I think Secretary Albright can give you some better sense of some of the work that remains with Commerce-State-Justice, with U.N. arrears and debt relief. That's not complete yet.
I think there's also some continuing discussion about some disaster relief in the aftermath of Hurricane Floyd. So there are a number of ongoing issues that still have yet to be resolved, but they're working all day today, and I know it is the stated goal of both Houses to try to wrap things up sometime today or tomorrow.
Q: Would the President sign any agreement while he's away, or wait until he gets back to D.C.?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, if they can't get something done, we'd have to do the continuing resolution from here, obviously. As far as how we would do any bills that come down, I don't know that we've even talked about that yet.

Bill Clinton,"November 17, 1999",Press Briefing by White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart,"Conrad International Hotel
Istanbul, Turkey
9:30 P.M. (L)
Q: Budget deal?
MR. LOCKHART: There is a meeting that's beginning at this moment on the Hill between the lead negotiators from the White House and the two parties on the Hill. We have some issues that we're continuing to work through. We've made progress over the last couple days, since I've talked to you last. Hopefully, they will be able to resolve some remaining issues and reach a deal.
Q: Why is the President willing to accept an across-the-board spending cut when he vetoed one just two weeks ago?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, there's a big difference between where we were a few weeks ago, when they were talking about a 1 percent, across-the-board cut with no management flexibility and what they're talking about now.
It's very clear from our negotiating that this is a hard and fast, bottom line position for the Republicans. The number -- not so much the number, but somehow the symbolic value of an across-the-board cut. But what we're looking at here now is something which is about a third of one percent, and which the President got a commitment from Speaker Hastert that there would be management flexibility. That is, the agencies will be able to go in and look at where they can save money, rather than have the projects that Congress has dictated in earmarks be protected, and having them go after things like personnel, which is not protected, so that's very important.
I think, overall, if you look at this, there's quite a contrast in the approaches of the two parties. The Republicans this year made much of political symbolism. They decided that the centerpiece of their legislative agenda was going to be a tax cut they couldn't pay for and the public didn't support. They spent half the year pushing that before they dropped that.
Now, at the end, symbolism again remains very important for them. We now have less than one-third of a percent reduction across government spending that's impact with the management flexibility will be de minimus. But they believe that this is what they want to have to make a political statement.
I think on the other hand, the Democrats have worked very hard with the President to do things like put 100,000 teachers in the classroom, put 50,000 cops on the street, protect the environment, pay our U.N. dues, be engaged around the world, and I think those are very real accomplishments and will be what the public remembers about this budget and this budget sees.
Q: Joe, have you got agreement to exempt some departments or agencies, and if you do, what are those agencies and departments?
MR. LOCKHART: There's no agreement that I know, as far as exempting a particular department or agency. What we're working for, and what we have a commitment, is for the agencies in the federal government to be given flexibility in management, in looking at where they'll need to find the 0.3 percent savings. And I think, in raw numbers, you're looking at something around $2 billion, which in the overall budget is small -- although it would be significant if it had to be done in a way that only went after things like personnel. So I think that was important -- it was an important commitment to make.
Again, we don't think -- even looking at this 0.3 percent, this statement that they've made, is the right statement about how to govern. We think budgeting is about tough choices, setting priorities and then making the tough choices. The Republicans have a different view. But we think we've accomplished a lot this year with Democratic leadership, from teachers to cops to protecting the environment to paying our dues at the U.N., international debt relief. There's a whole long list of things, and those are important. And if they need to make a statement in order to get enough votes on their side, and to address issues within their caucus, well, then we'll move forward.
Q: Joe, this is only -- if the across-the-board is only $2 billion, where does the rest of the $6 billion or $7 billion come from? What are the other offsets?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, that's one of the things that we're still talking about. They're in now, and we have said all along that spending has to paid for and that's what we're working with them on.
Q: -- some sort of fee increases or tax increases or revenue increases?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, we have put on the table ideas for closing corporate loopholes. This is something that's actively being discussed at the table. And, you know, hopefully, if all goes well, if they can break this meeting, we can give you a lot more details.
Q: Do you mean tonight? Do you mean later tonight?
MR. LOCKHART: Possibly.
Q: How are you going to tell us that?
Q: Can you tell us the status of the mining rider? And has the President sent a letter to Senator Byrd, outlining his objections and where he stands on --
MR. LOCKHART: The President has sent a letter to Senator Byrd arguing strongly that this rider is unacceptable to the White House. We've worked very hard to remove a number of riders from the Interior Bill. And we've made clear in the letter to Senator Byrd that we find the proposed rider that he has authored unacceptable.
Q: Why? Can you tell us why?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, we believe that it's unnecessary at this point. We have proposed some ideas that will provide an interim solution while this matter goes through judicial review, which it's in now, the judge has ordered a stay. And we think given all of the important work we've done on the Interior Bill this kind of rider at this time is something we can't accept.
Q: Joe, does the President take seriously the criticism of the China trade deal from big labor, Teamsters? The President called it a slap in the face. And John Sweeney says it's disgustingly hypocritical.
MR. LOCKHART: Well, I think the President takes seriously and wants all segments of the American population, including organized labor, to ultimately support this deal or understand the reasons that we're moving forward. He's going to work very hard in the coming weeks and months to make the case for the benefits to American workers and business of the WTO agreement. He will talk to members of Congress. He's actually already, I think, talked to some members about what we need to do. And I expect that the support will be there. There is overwhelming benefits to our country from this agreement that are demonstrable from, and will become more clear as all of the details from this agreement emerge, so I think the President believes that there is support out there for it, and we will work closely with Congress to codify that in a way where we can move forward.
Q: Joe, is the President disappointed that Vice President Gore doesn't support the deal on U.N.-backed dues and family planning overseas?
MR. LOCKHART: I think this was a particularly unnecessary fight that we have engaged in with Capitol Hill now for running on three, four, five years. The U.N. is an important organization. Our ability to pay our dues and keep our vote in the general assembly is crucial to our position in the world. The fact that a small number of members of Congress have held it up over a side issue has been completely unnecessary and destructive over the last three years.
We have crafted an arrangement that will not interfere with international family planning and pay our U.N. dues, and provide a commitment that the President called for in Cologne to debt relief. There are some who disagree with that, but we believe that this is a good deal, will provide for no real interference with international family planning. It only will remain in place for 10 months.
I suspect that, given an up or down vote on this, on its merits, it wouldn't be close in the Congress if they decide to take this up next year, and it was worthwhile in going forward.
Q: Joe, does the President feel the Vice President was disloyal by criticizing this?
MR. LOCKHART: No. I think the President believes that as he goes forward in his effort to make the case for why he's best prepared to be President. He needs to express his views, and he doesn't feel in any way dissatisfied with his expressions.
Q: Joe, Russian leaders have said that it's hypocritical for America to take the moral high ground on the Chechnya issue because of the civilian casualties incurred in the crisis over Kosovo. So where do you get the moral authority to criticize Russia in the way that you have?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, we believe that a solution to this crisis has to be found through a political dialogue. We've been very concerned in the indiscriminate use of violence, which was, as you remember, never used in Kosovo. In Kosovo, there were great pains taken to minimize civilian casualties. And we believe that it's a case that the international community is making strongly, and speaking very strongly together on.
Q: But Russia says it's using the same type of cautions, and that the civilian casualties are unintended.
MR. LOCKHART: Well, I will leave it to others to compare. I think we have concerns that there is indiscriminate use of violence in the escalation of the conflict in the last several months.
Q: Joe, do you know if the Greek government consulted the U.S. about its decision to ban demonstrations in the neighborhoods that the President will be in on Saturday?
MR. LOCKHART: I think you should assume that on all issues, from security to logistics to the substantive program of the trip, there have been wide-ranging discussions between the United States government and the Greek government.
Q: Does that mean that the United States backs the Greek government's decision to bar demonstrations in certain areas?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, I think that that is a decision for the Greek government to make. But it's certainly one that we understand.
Thank you.
Q: No, one more.
MR. LOCKHART: Oh.
Q: On Egyptair, sorry.
MR. LOCKHART: Yes?
Q: Do you all have any concerns about whether Egypt is going to try to take the investigation back, or what the status of that is right now?
MR. LOCKHART: The status is that the NTSB is leading this investigation. That's where the information should come from. I have not heard any concern expressed that somehow the Egyptian government would try to take control of the investigation. They've worked closely with us from the beginning in a very cooperative way, and we expect that to continue.
Thank you.
Q: Hey Joe, do you know how many bilaterals the President's having? Yeltsin has 11:00 a.m. tomorrow --
MR. LOCKHART: Chirac.
Q: Chirac, at what time?
MR. LOCKHART: I don't know the time, but I think it's supposed to be done by about 3:00 p.m., so 2:00 p.m. sounds about right.
Q: Joe, is anybody else --
MR. LOCKHART: Let me check the schedule.
Q: Okay.
Q: If there is a budget deal, when would you expect the President to talk about it?
MR. LOCKHART: Depends on when the budget deal is announced. I wouldn't expect that if it's struck at 3:00 in the morning, that there's any reason to stay up.
Q: Do you think he'd talk about it at some photo op tomorrow somewhere?
MR. LOCKHART: Yes. I think as a practical matter, if it's something done in the middle of the night, we'll find an opportunity in the morning. If it happens ten minutes from now, you know, we may find a way twenty minutes from now. But I don't expect that to happen.
Q: How about three hours from now?
MR. LOCKHART: Three hours from now?
Q: One o'clock.
MR. LOCKHART: I think that's a little late.
Q: Good.
Q: Thank you.
MR. LOCKHART: Okay.

Bill Clinton,"November 18, 1999",Remarks at the Opening of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe Summit in Istanbul,"Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. President Demirel, Chairman Vollebaek, Mr. Secretary-General, Miss Degn, distinguished leaders, it's a great honor for me to be able to say a few words on behalf of the United States.
First, I thank President Demirel, his government, and the people of Turkey for a wonderful reception and for the heroic example they have set in their recovery from the earthquakes. I thank the Norwegian Chairman-in-Office for remarkable leadership in a very challenging year.
We come together for many reasons, first, to reaffirm our commitment to the OSCE, a unique institution grounded in the principle that the root of human insecurity is the denial of human rights. Here today are leaders of more than 20 countries that were not even in existence when the Final Act was signed in Helsinki in 1975, because they were not free.
In country after country, the OSCE's ideas of human rights and the rule of law are now ascendant. A quarter century after Helsinki, the question is not whether democracy will survive but when it will be embraced in every European country and how it will work in every country.
Clearly, we must adapt the OSCE to meet new realities. The charter we've negotiated recognizes that the greatest threats to our security today are as likely to come from conflicts that begin within states as between them.
The OSCE has responded to this challenge with courage and distinction, from the Balkans to the Baltics, organizing elections, monitoring human rights, reducing ethnic and religious tensions. We must give the OSCE the tools to respond even more effectively. I am pleased the OSCE is endorsing the REACT concept, which will enable it to deploy experts in elections, law, media, and administration rapidly to nations seeking to prevent or recover from conflict. That way, time and lives won't be lost while we organize from scratch to meet every crisis.
I'm pleased we're endorsing the achievements of the Stability Pact, and pledging to support its work, for there must be a magnet of unifying force more powerful than the forces of division and fear in order for southeastern Europe to reach its full potential.
I'm pleased we have recognized the needs to fill the gap that civilian police forces must fill between unarmed monitors and military forces, and I hope that all of us will be willing to strengthen the OSCE's capacity to meet that need.
Now, in addition to making the OSCE more operational, we have to uphold its principles in hard cases. In that spirit, I would like to say a few words about the situation in Chechnya. First of all, I associate myself with the previous remarks of the German Chancellor, which I think made the case very well. But I think I speak for everyone here when we say we want Russia to overcome the scourge of terrorism and lawlessness. We believe Russia has not only the right but the obligation to defend its territorial integrity. We want to see Russia a stable, prosperous, strong democracy with secure borders, strong defenses, and a leading voice in world affairs.
I have often asked myself, as I hope all of you have, what I would do if I were in President Yeltsin's place. I think before any of us sit in judgment, we should be able to answer that question.
Russia has faced rebellion within and related violence beyond the borders of Chechnya. It has responded with a military strategy designed to break the resistance and end the terror. The strategy has led to substantial civilian casualties and very large flows of refugees.
The first thing I would like to say is that most of the critics of Russian policies deplore Chechen violence and terrorism and extremism, and support the objectives of Russia to preserve its territorial integrity and to put down the violence and the terrorism. What they fear is that the means Russia has chosen will undermine its ends, that if attacks on civilians continue, the extremism Russia is trying to combat will only intensify, and the sovereignty Russia rightly is defending will be more and more rejected by ordinary Chechens who are not part of the terror or the resistance. The strength Russia rightly is striving to build, therefore, could be eroded by an endless cycle of violence. The global integration Russia has rightly sought to advance, with our strong support, will be hindered.
Russia's friends are united, I believe, in what we think should happen: appropriate measures to end terrorism, protection of innocent civilians, a commitment to allow refugees to return in safety, access for relief groups, and a common effort to rebuild. In other words, in order to isolate and undermine the terrorists, there must be a political dialog and a political settlement, not with terrorists but with those who are willing to seek a peaceful resolution.
The OSCE and others can play a role in facilitating that dialog, as they did once before, and that is the role the OSCE was meant to play. Meanwhile, I think we should all make it clear that we are prepared to do more, through the United Nations, through this organization, and through any other available forum, to combat terror wherever it exists.
Finally, let me say I have to respectfully disagree with my friend President Yeltsin in his characterization of U.S.-led NATO aggression in Yugoslavia. Consider Bosnia, where the world community waited 4 years, and we saw 2 1/2 million refugees and 250,000 deaths placed on the altar of ethnic cleansing. I honor and praise the courage of the Secretary-General and the United Nations for acknowledging just a few days ago the grievous error of the U.N. in waiting so long to act, and that wait being responsible in part for the travesty of Srebrenica.
Consider Kosovo, where the world community did not wait, but there were still thousands of deaths and hundreds of thousands of refugees. But unlike Bosnia, because we acted more quickly, they are almost all home today, coming to grips with the challenge of the coming winter. So I believe we did the right thing. And I do not believe there will ever be a time in human affairs when we will ever be able to say, we simply cannot criticize this or that or the other action because it happened within the territorial borders of a single nation.
President Yeltsin, one of the most thrilling experiences of my life as a citizen of the world before I became President was when you stood up on that tank in Moscow, when they tried to take the freedom of the Russian people away, and you're standing there on that tank, said to those people, ""You can do this, but you'll have to kill me first.""
If they had put you in jail instead of electing you President, I would hope that every leader of every country around this table would have stood up for you and for freedom in Russia and not said, ""Well, that is an internal Russian affair that we cannot be a part of."" I don't think we have any choice but to try to work for common objectives across lines. And I certainly associate myself with any efforts that we can make together to fight terrorism within any nation's borders.
Let me just say this in closing. We are here in Turkey, and it's an appropriate place to say this, thinking of Chechnya, thinking of all these issues, thinking of the trouble in the Caucasus and the trouble in the Balkans. So much of the future of the 21st century will turn on developments in the vast region that lies between traditional notions of Asia and Europe, between the Muslim world and the West, between the parts of our community that are stable and prosperous and democratic and those still struggling to build basic human security and freedom.
The people who live in these crossroads face truly momentous challenges, and we're dealing with some of them today. They are trying to preserve their unique heritage and participate fully in the modern world. And there is no single, simple answer to all their problems, but there is a guidepost: this OSCE and its principle that human differences should be resolved democratically, with respect for diversity and the basic rights and freedom of every individual. That was true in 1975. It is even more true today.
Thank you very much.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-opening-the-organization-for-security-and-cooperation-europe-summit-istanbul
Bill Clinton,"November 18, 1999",Remarks on the Budget Agreement and an Exchange With Reporters in Istanbul,"The President. I am very pleased that our administration and the Congress have reached agreement on the first budget of the 21st century. This budget is a victory, and a hard-won victory, for the American people. It is a victory for our children who now will have better education; a victory for our families who deserve the safer streets and cleaner environment this budget will bring; a victory for farmers, for veterans, for our soldiers in uniform. It is a victory for all who agree that America should meet our responsibilities and maintain our leadership in the world. Simply put, it's a budget that meets our priorities, supports our values, and invests in our future.
The budget makes progress on several important fronts. The first budget of the 21st century puts education first, as it should. That's why I stood firm for our commitment to hire 100,000 highly qualified teachers to lower class size in the early grades. I am pleased that Congress is going to fulfill that promise, and I am also pleased that this budget doubles funds for afterschool and summer school programs and supports greater accountability for results by helping communities turn around or shut down failing schools.
The budget makes America a safer place. It invests in our COPS program, which already has funded 100,000 community police officers for our streets and helped to give us the lowest crime rate in 25 years. This agreement will help to hire up to 50,000 more community police officers targeted to neighborhoods where crime rates are still too high.
It strengthens our efforts to preserve natural areas and protect our environment. I am very pleased we successfully opposed antienvironmental riders that put special interests above the national interest.
The budget will also make it possible for millions of Americans with disabilities to join the work force without fear of losing their health care, a terrific advance in the quality of our national life.
Finally, this budget strengthens America's role of leadership in the world by paying our dues and arrears to the United Nations, by meeting our commitments to the Middle East peace process, by making critical investments in debt relief for the poorest countries of the world, by funding efforts to safeguard nuclear weapons and expertise in Russia.
When I insisted that Congress keep working until it finished the job, I hoped and believed we could make progress in all these areas. I believe we can maintain our fiscal discipline, continue to pay down our national debt, and still make the investments we must in our people and our future. That is what we have achieved, and we have done so by working together.
I want to thank the leaders of both parties for their roles in this agreement, and I want to say a special word of thanks to the Democratic leaders and the members of my party in both Houses without whom my struggle for 100,000 teachers, 50,000 police, greater investments in the environment, and paying our U.N. dues could simply not have succeeded. I thank them very much.
Q. Mr. President——
The President. Now, let me just say one other thing, then I'll answer the questions. We are about to start the holiday season, and then we'll begin again. And in the months ahead, I think we have to stay focused on the critical business of this Nation that is still undone, from commonsense gun safety legislation to meaningful hate crimes legislation, from a real raise in the minimum wage to a real Patients' Bill of Rights, from strengthening Social Security to modernizing Medicare and adding a prescription drug benefit. I urge Congress to work with me in meeting these goals in the same bipartisan spirit it took to reach this very important budget agreement.
Thank you.
Across-the-Board Budget Cut
Q. Mr. President, just a week ago, when the Republicans were calling for an across-the-board budget cut of about a half a percent, just a tenth of a percent more than the one that you accepted, you said that it was unacceptable. What makes this one acceptable, sir, and would the budget as the Republicans have written it still, in your opinion, dip into the Social Security surplus?
The President. Well, first of all, when I remember saying it was unacceptable, they were advocating a one percent across the board which some thought would have to be 6 percent to avoid getting in the Social Security Trust Fund. This one is, I think, about a third, a little more than a third of what their last offer was on one percent.
It also is written in such a way as to preserve the management flexibility of the departments so that we can fulfill the mission. Let me give you just one example. When the Pentagon— do you remember when the one percent acrossthe-board proposal was made and the Pentagon said, ""Gosh, we may have to lay off 38,000 uniform and non-uniform personnel?"" That was on the assumption that they would have to take the across-the-board dollar amount but fulfill every mandate Congress had imposed in the defense budget.
And so now they've given the Secretaries some flexibility so that we can maintain the core responsibilities of Government. Furthermore, we now have agreements in education and in the environment and in other areas which have raised the investment level to such a point that we can take that across-the-board cut, still have a real increase, still be moving forward. So I think we're in a very different environment than we were just a few days ago, and I'm quite pleased by this.
Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Chechnya
Q. Mr. President, President Yeltsin was pretty tough in defending his military actions in Chechnya and saying that he was going to deal with bandits and terrorists. In your private meeting, was he just as frank? I mean, could you describe the talk and tell us what happened?
The President. Yes. He was very vigorous, and so was I; and you know, we've met together many times. We have a very good personal chemistry, but it didn't stop us from our clear disagreement here.
I would never criticize anyone taking vigorous action against terrorism. I think that's very important. The real question is whether or not the nature of this uprising in Chechnya can be solved exclusively by a military strategy. And I think you could see—you can sense in this audience—it's not just the United States; it's virtually all the Europeans don't believe that an exclusively military strategy can prevail, that it will lead to greater than necessary civilian casualties and greater than necessary refugees.
So I can only tell you that he stated his position. I stated mine. But I urged them to try to listen to Russia's friends at this conference and try to find a way that we could work together and move this thing forward. And I am hopeful that you will see some progress here before we leave. I can't say for sure that you will. I hope you will.
Q. Mr. President, you made some conciliatory remarks during your speech. Does that reflect the feeling that maybe you've pushed him as far as you can rhetorically and through any kind of action the Government can take?
The President. I don't know. Everybody else here thought that I was pretty aggressive.
Q. Well, you referred to standing up to the tanks and so forth.
The President. But the point I was trying to make here—let me just say there are two separate issues here. One is—and I think this is worth taking a second. There are two separate issues here. One is President Yeltsin's view that what they're doing is right in Chechnya and the differences of opinion we have. The second is the general Russian view with which I take very strong exception that no one should, in effect, comment on or interfere with any internal affair of any other nation. And you heard him refer to American-led NATO aggression in the Balkans.
And so I responded very vigorously about Bosnia, about Kosovo. And the point I made was, when I was very personally complimentary of him is, when he stood up on that tank to save Russian democracy, suppose he hadn't prevailed. Suppose the Russian military had taken him down off the tank, thrown him in jail, and announced they were going to execute him.
I would hope that the entire world represented around that table, that OSCE table today, would have gone into an absolute uproar of outrage about it and would have saved his life and helped to restore democracy. That's the point I was trying to make, that there are times in the world we live in today when we are forced to make judgments about things that happen within the borders of other countries because they have an impact beyond their borders and because they violate internationally accepted norms of human rights. That's what happened in Bosnia; that's what happened in Kosovo. I think I did the right thing. And I hope it registered on the Russians, and I hope we're going to make some progress. I think we are.
I'll see you all some more in the next day or two, but I've got to go to this lunch.

Bill Clinton,"November 18, 1999",Press Briefing by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright,"Conrad International Hotel
Istanbul, Turkey
7:47 P.M. (L)
MR. HAMMER: Mr. Berger briefed you on the President's bilateral meetings today and Secretary Albright is now here to brief on today's OSCE activities. We have about 15 minutes. I understand there's going to be a briefing on the budget piped in from Washington beginning about 8:00 p.m. our time, so we have about 15 minutes.
Secretary Albright.
SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: We took an important next step in defining international norms today, in fact, of signing, being prepared to sign the charter of the OSCE. In 1975, with the Helsinki Final Act, what had happened was the international community decided that human rights were everybody's business. And what has happened as a result of today is that it, in effect, we have made -- the consensus of the OSCE is that conflicts within societies that could potentially also cause regional instability were also everybody's business, and that language is embodied within the charter. And I do think that this is an important step in terms of creating tools that might help countries deal with the kinds of internal conflicts that have become, unfortunately, more prevalent.
Obviously, as we were here, the question also was, how would Chechnya impact on this particular discussion and these decisions. And when we got here, we felt on the Chechnya issue that we needed, as an organization, to pay more attention to the humanitarian tragedy, to pay more attention to making clear that a political solution was necessary, not a military one, to pay more attention to abiding by international norms, and trying to determine what kind of a role the OSCE could play within that Chechnya problem.
As a result of very long negotiations, we were able to come to agreement on language that would go into the summit declaration. And what we managed to do was to, first of all, recognize the territorial integrity of Russia and to condemn terrorism, but also to make quite clear that there needed to be respect for OSCE norms, that there had to be and could be humanitarian assistance, including by international organizations, that we agreed on the need for a political solution, that the OSCE could contribute to that political solution, that the OSCE was willing to assist in developing a political dialogue, that the Russian Federation would agree to invite the Chairman in Office for a visit, and we reaffirmed the original mandate for the mandate of the OSCE mission from three years ago.
So we did, I believe, accomplish what we wanted in terms of the role of the OSCE in the Chechnya tragedies that are going on, and I believe have made it clear that international norms need to be respected. President Yeltsin came to this meeting with his goal to explain his view of what was happening in Chechnya. When he was here, he heard from other nations that they saw it differently. And he obviously instructed his foreign minister to work with the rest of us in trying to forge the kind of agreement that I've talked about so that we would be in a position to adopt the charter of the OSCE and take the next step of now making it clear that living up to international norms as far as conflicts in societies are concerned, is the business of the OSCE, and there was a consensus agreement on that.
Q: Madam Secretary, are you satisfied with today's results, and do you think it will change anything on the ground?
SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: As I've said, I think we came here with trying to do something about paying attention to the humanitarian situation and all the -- I won't go through this all again, but I think we did manage to get agreement on a lot of very important parts of it. I think that the United Nations is going in to look at the humanitarian situation. I think we have made clear that more humanitarian assistance needs to be given, and that the OSCE Chairman in office has to have a role.
I think -- I'm not going to oversell this. I think that we accomplished a lot. But this is a longer-term problem, and I think that we need to keep pushing it along, and we have been given more tools to deal with it. And I'm sure that the Russians heard a general sense of disquiet about the way that the Chechnya issue was handled. But I think that this is a long process, we have begun on a new road in terms of how the OSCE works, and I have to tell you, I had a very interesting conversation today with President Havel, and we talked about the 1975 Helsinki Final Act, and the fact that human rights became everybody's business as a result of that act was not evident the next day. It was evident in subsequent years, and he, of course, is the epitome of it, having started Charter 77.
Q: Did you go any distance at all to convincing Russia to dial back on its use of military force in Chechnya?
SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: We certainly talked a great deal about the need for a political solution, and the fact that the military approach here, as President Clinton said, had the danger of creating a vicious cycle.
Q: I want to be clear. Did Foreign Minister Ivanov specifically agree to this visit by the OSCE Chairman and to put that in the summit declaration? And if so, when would that visit be?
SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: He did agree to it, it is going to be in the summit declaration, and I can't tell you exactly when it's going to be -- soon.
Q: Is it fair to say that you wanted the OSCE to negotiate, however, and all you really got an agreement, and the OSCE Chairman should go to Moscow to talk about talks?
SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: The Europeans, earlier in the week, had called for a strong role by the OSCE, a mission, and I think that we got a good foot in the door on that.
Q: Madam Secretary, can you say how hard it's going to be to identify people to negotiate with in Chechnya?
SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: I think this is one of the points that has been made, is that it is not easy to identify them, but I think there has to be an effort made to do so. And that, I think, is what has been missing is really looking for people that can legitimately negotiate.
Q: Madam Secretary, if you've reached agreement on the charter, when will the charter be signed, if that's what you're trying to tell us? And, secondly, was any of the language modified and any reference in the new charter to interference in the internal affairs of a nation?
SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: Well, first of all, let me say the charter, as far as things look now, will be signed tomorrow, and I was not negotiating the language on the charter part, but I think from our perspective, we got what we needed in terms of creating this norm now, that it was everybody's -- it was the OSCE's business to be able to deal with civil conflicts and the creation of tools -- for instance, this REACT force -- REACT group, that is able to go in rapidly in order to try to do conflict prevention, so that there would be a way to try to avoid some of the particular conflicts from escalating even more.
So what it did in the charter was make clear that it was the business of OSCE to deal with these internal conflicts and created the tools for how to do it.
Q: What will the OSCE chairman seek to do on the visit to Chechnya?
SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: Well, I think those are the other things that we're going to be discussing with him. All of us will be, I think, setting out various things for him to do. But what is important is that what came out of the language that we negotiated is that the OSCE is willing to assist in the political dialogue and there is agreement on the fact that a political solution is essential; and that the assistance of the OSCE would contribute to achieving that goal.
Q: Will the Chairman go to Moscow or Chechnya?
SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: Chechnya.
Q: Can you update us on the status of the CFE? And if it is going to be signed by the U.S., whether you think that under current circumstances there are any chances it would be ratified?
SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: Let me say the negotiations are going on as we speak. One of the aspects of the amended CFE is that forces -- that countries can make decisions about the forces that they have on their own territory. And some of the issues obviously have to do with Georgia and Moldova, and discussions are still going on. I don't want to speculate beyond that because the negotiations are going on right now.
Q: Have you considered how popular President Yeltin's handling of the Chechnya crisis is within Russia and that President Clinton's statements this morning are being played up in the Russian media as being supportive of his policies, should the President's language have been tougher?
SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: I think the President's language has been applauded by every foreign minister that's come up to me today for having been so astute in the way that it pointed out to President Yeltsin why it was important for the international community to care about events within a country.
And when he compared -- when he said that we all cared when he got up on a tank, that there was a reason for the international community to care when something is going on in a country. He made very clear that he did not agree with the way that the situation was being handled. He associated himself with Chancellor Schroeder's remarks and made very clear in his own words why he felt that the Russian approach was wrong and that it would be leading to a cycle of violence and needed a political solution. He also made quite clear that he did not accept President Yeltsin's statement about U.S.-led NATO aggression on Yugoslovia.
So I think he was very direct, very tough, and very astute in the way that he spoke directly to Boris Yeltsin about why this was wrong.
Q: Madam Secretary, do you have any idea how the across-the-board budget cut in the new budget deal will affect your department?
SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: Well, I must say that I'm looking at this in a positive way because when we started these budget negotiations, I thought that we'd have to kind of hang it up at the State Department because we had no money. And instead, what has happened -- while we have not gotten everything that we asked for in the President's original request, we did get the Wye money, we got the threat reduction debt relief, peacekeeping, embassy security, and obviously, also U.N. arrears.
So I'm feeling very good about what we have gotten in terms of being able to actually carry out foreign policy, and while we obviously need more, and my budget is still only less than one percent of the federal budget -- one penny out of every dollar goes to preventing wars from happening and what I call the first line of defense, our diplomacy -- we are certainly better off than we were before.
And there were some very hard decisions to be made in order to get this budget. Probably the hardest that any of us have had to make, who particularly care about the issue of family planning -- and I felt, as Secretary of State, it probably was one of the most difficult decisions that I had -- and we are going to try to do everything we can to minimize the effect of that decision.
Thank you.

Bill Clinton,"November 18, 1999",Press Briefing by National Security Advisor Sandy Berger,"The Conrad Hotel
Istanbul, Turkey
7:00 P.M. (L)
MR. BERGER: Now, I get so little respect from Leavy that he doesn't even introduce me. (Laughter.)
Let me give you a readout on the meeting between President Yeltsin and President Clinton. It was a vigorous meeting, the two Presidents expressing strong convictions. They expressed their views on Chechnya, not too dissimilar from what you heard in the plenary session.
The hallmark of this relationship, however, has been the willingness of President Yeltsin and President Clinton to work through difficult issues. And I don't know that we convinced President Yeltsin on Chechnya -- he certainly didn't convince us that the course that they're on is not -- is likely to succeed. But I do think it was useful for President Yeltsin to be here today to hear the voices of the international -- his colleagues, which were quite uniform in expressing their concerns, not hostilely toward Russia, but out of concern for the impact that this could have on Russia.
The meeting, however, was, I think, cordial in its tone. It ended -- it actually both began and ended by President Yeltsin telling President Clinton that he owed him a visit to Moscow. At the end, saying that he hoped he would get him a date soon for coming to Moscow to continue the dialogue sometime next year. We will look at our schedule.
Now, on Chechnya, as I said it was quite consistent in essence with the exchange you heard this morning. President Yeltsin said that Russia is under the threat of what he described as ""merciless terrorists;"" that they were in favor of peace, but that that was only possible by eliminating the terrorists. He said that their intent is not to harm civilians, but that this -- that the rebels in Chechnya not only were indigenous, but also were increasingly being supported by radical fundamentalists from the region.
The President said to him that we don't disagree on the need to combat terrorism, but said that -- and that we would be prepared to work with Russia on cutting off resources to terrorist organizations, particularly international terrorist organizations -- but that we feel that the situation on the ground here is such that the civilians and rebels are intermingled, and makes it very difficult to avoid civilian casualties. Therefore, the President said, the means that you're using will undermine your ends, and lead to a cycle of violence. And that's why we're urging a political dialogue to achieve a political settlement. Again, this was, I would say, at least half the meeting, discussing Chechnya.
But on other subjects, they talked about arms control. They reviewed the recent exchange of letters that I mentioned to you yesterday on both nuclear reductions, the ABM treaty, NMD. I think the President clarified for President Yeltsin some legislation that he had signed last year which had some prefatory language about national missile defense, which Yeltsin believed reflected a firm decision on our part. The President explained, as I have here before, that he will decide this next year based on the four factors that I've talked about: threat, cost, technical feasibility, and the effect on arms control, and our overall security.
The President reiterated that the NMD systems that we're looking at are directed at rogue states -- maybe even, 10 years from now, terrorists who might have missiles; that Russia's own generals say they can overwhelm this system, and therefore it should not be a threat to their deterrence. They agreed to continue parallel discussions on START III and the ABM.
President Yeltsin raised the question of going further than we have before on dealing with plutonium stockpiles. He said he was increasingly concerned with this because of the risk that they could get in the hands of terrorists. We have had good cooperation with the Russians in this area in the past, and the President suggested that we have our experts discuss how we can intensify that.
President Yeltsin noted -- I would say with a little bit of irony in his voice -- that the Duma had approved the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in the past several days. The President indicated that he believed, as he said before, that the Senate at some point will take this up again, and eventually will ratify the CTBT.
On the CFE agreement, they noted that we're in the final stages of negotiation, and the President indicated the importance of Russia concluding agreements with Georgia and Moldova relating to agreement to withdraw their forces from those two countries, something that we have been urging the Russians to do now for quite sometime. Those negotiations are going on here in Istanbul; hopefully, they will reach a successful conclusion. I think they're at a quite advanced stage.
And then some discussion of the upcoming elections. The President talked about how important that was, the succession of democracy from one leader to another. Yeltsin described the political process underway, and the President underscored that elections and democracy were the key to Russia's transformation and would be an historic moment for Russia.
And, again, as I say, the conversation ended -- I think the meeting lasted about an hour, and the conversation ended with President Yeltsin saying, come to Russia and we will continue this discussion for three days.
Q: Sandy, in the end, did President Yeltsin yield any ground? We had a German diplomat saying that he's agreed to allow the OSCE head into Chechnya, and has agreed to work for a political solution. Are you aware of any concessions that he made or any ground --
MR. BERGER: He left Foreign Minister Ivanov behind. He said, Mr. Ivanov will negotiate with your ministers. The foreign ministers have been meeting this afternoon and I believe Secretary Albright may be by in a bit to bring you up to date on where those discussions go.
Let me simply frame that -- tomorrow, there are three possible documents that will be signed. One is, as I've said before, the CFE agreement. Two is the OSCE Charter, which we talked about before. And three is a declaration.
In the declaration, we have proposed some language relating to OSCE engagement in Chechnya. That is what's being discussed. It's obviously a consensus document; therefore, the Russians would have to agree to it. And I think I'll leave to Secretary Albright -- and I think she'll be by shortly -- to describe where that is.
Q: The President said, in talking about an OSCE negotiations, that there were people other than terrorists that --
MR. BERGER: I'm sorry, I can't hear you.
Q: The President said, with respect to the OSCE negotiations, that if the Russians would agree to it, there were people other than terrorists in Chechnya that could be negotiated with. President Yeltsin's remarks seemed to say that his argument was not with people who want to talk peace, but with the people -- with the terrorists themselves. Was there any movement inside the meeting? Any discussion? Any attempt to identify a group of people that the two could sit down and talk with?
MR. BERGER: Well, I think that's an important -- that, in general terms, was discussed. I mean, President Yeltsin said, I will not negotiate with terrorists, with bandits. And he described, in some detail, the activities of some of these groups in Chechnya, and the support they receive from outside interests, outside terrorist groups, et cetera.
The President said, I'm not talking about negotiating with terrorists. I'm talking about negotiating with those people in Chechnya who seek to have a peaceful resolution, and isolating the terrorists. And, again, President Yeltsin didn't say -- there was no agreement on that, but I think to the extent that President Yeltsin was here today and heard what President Clinton said, heard what Chancellor Schroeder said, heard what Mr. Ahtisaari said and others that were after us, hopefully that will push him down the road toward seeking a political solution.
Q: Sandy, is there an analogy here? Maybe it's a poor one, but Yeltsin would negotiate -- let's take the Northern Ireland example -- he would negotiate with somebody like Sinn Fein but not with the IRA, is that the idea?
MR. BERGER: I think -- I've learned never to use metaphors -- (laughter) -- so I can't even use analogies. But I think the concept here I agree with, which is we're not suggesting that he should sit down with those forces in Chechnya who are, in fact, killing innocent people, have attacked Dagestan, who have been engaged in terrorist activities. I don't think anybody disputes the fact that Chechnya is a haven for terrorists and secessionists. But there are certainly other forces in Chechnya -- it's not for me to describe them or designate them who want this over, who want peace.
One of the reasons we would like to see some greater OSCE role -- again, I don't think it's the be-all and the end-all, but an intermediary here may be able to help create that dialogue.
Q: Can you please enlighten us on the circumstances -- could you please explain the circumstances of Yeltsin's departure? There have been conflicting reports about this. Did he leave when he planned to leave? Did he leave early because he was angry about the Chechnya part of the declaration?
MR. BERGER: I spoke to my opposite number and President Chirac before coming over here to make sure that I understood the dynamic. President Yeltsin had always planned to arrive last night and leave today. That had always been his intention. The meeting with President Chirac and Chancellor Schroeder, according to French government officials who were in the meeting, was very cordial, brief.
President Yeltsin said, I want to focus on a time when we can meet -- I think he said in Paris -- for a whole day and talk about European security issues and these issues. And they reached an agreement to a meeting, I think, sometime in December, and had a brief discussion and left not at all on an angry note. Whether that was by virtue of pressing business in Moscow or stamina or what, I can't speculate. But it was not stomping out of the room.
Q: Your assessment on today's meeting between the Prime Minister and President Clinton -- Simitis and Ecevit -- sees both sides express a kind of satisfaction --
MR. BERGER: I'm pleased that the two foreign ministers met again. I believe this is the fourth time -- Simitis and Ecevit -- I'm very pleased that they met, as is the President. I think it's appropriate for them to comment on the substance of their meeting, not for me. But, in general, as we've said before, we find this general thawing of relations to be very, very hopeful.
Q: Sandy, I know Secretary Albright's coming, but could you describe the flavor of the Chechnya language in the charter?
MR. BERGER: No, I really -- she's been in these negotiations representing the President, and both is more familiar with the language and I think it's more appropriate for her to -- I'm not trying to duck anything, I just think it's more appropriate -- she'll be better able to answer your questions, I think.
Q: You said the President spoke about the impact of the Chechnya crisis continuing and the status quo would have on Russia. What did he say about what that --
MR. BERGER: I'm sorry, for some reason I'm having a hard time tonight hearing you.
Q: You said that the President spoke with Yeltsin about the impact that a continuation of the Chechnya crisis at its current stage would have on Russia. What impact did he describe, and how is it that it will have some serious impact on Russia if, in all the bilateral relationships with other countries, it doesn't seem to have had a serious impact?
MR. BERGER: First of all, internally, there's an awful lot of resources that Russia is now expending on this conflict in Chechnya -- resources that obviously are needed for its domestic economy. So, number one, it's a diversion of resources, it's a diversion of the focus and attention of Russian government officials, and the greater degree of instability that is created in the Northern Caucasus -- this is a problem that could spread rather than be contained by continuing conflict.
So I think the President is referring in particular, and more importantly to Russia, to the effect on Russia -- in Russia.
Q: Sandy, the Europeans and Mr. Ahtisaari used the word ""condemn"" in referring to the events in Chechnya. It didn't seem to me that the President's speech was anywhere near as strong, using language anywhere near as strong as that. Would you accept that?
MR. BERGER: No. We can stack up adjectives, I suppose, and see who has the larger, bigger pile. I don't think there was any question to anybody that was listening; the President was very firm in what he is saying. He was trying to persuade. He was trying to have an impact on Yeltsin. And he did that, I think, in a forceful way. And I think he did that in a clear way. And there was no mistaking his position.
And I think, in particular, when Yeltsin took a swipe at the United States for aggression in Kosovo, I thought the President's rejoinder was both powerful and quite telling. And almost everybody in that room -- that room was electrified at that moment. And I think almost everybody came up to the President afterwards and said they thought it was a very convincing way of making the point to Yeltsin that what goes on within a country is no longer simply a matter for that country; that the international community -- after the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, after the Helsinki Final Act, after an OSCE Charter that we may sign tomorrow -- that the international community does have a right and obligation to express its concerns.
And by putting it in terms that I think Yeltsin could relate to -- what would happen if you, having stood on that tank, had been arrested? Would you have wanted the international community to be silent, or to stand up and condemn it? I thought that was an extraordinarily powerful way of making that point.
Q: Was he making some kind of analogy to democracy in Chechnya?
MR. BERGER: No. There are two different issues here. Put Chechnya aside. Yeltsin was, and has, challenged -- and did in his intervention -- this is none of your business, he has said to the world. This is none of your business, Chechnya. This is our business; stay out of our business.
And the President was saying, that's wrong; it's not just your business, it's the international community's business, because violations of human rights are matters that the international community has a right and obligation to speak to. And particularly as friends of Russia, we have an obligation to speak up when we think you're headed -- you're on a course that is going to be damaging. So the point the President was addressing was Yeltsin's point that the international community had no right to condemn them for what was going on in Chechnya.
Q: Sandy, do you have any reason to believe that Yeltsin will be influenced by any of the things that were said today?
MR. BERGER: I don't know the answer to that, Mark. I think the fact that he came, in and of itself, was, I think, an interesting fact, and suggests that Russia does care about the international community and seeks to maintain its relationships with the international community. I think he was hearing this from people who have been -- Jacques Chirac, and the Germans, and the President -- who have been supportive of Russia's democracy, supportive of what Russia has been seeking to do in general; not people who have been hostile.
So I hope it has some impact. I can't say whether it will or not. But I think we have an obligation to try to express our concerns.
Q: Can you describe the meeting with Chirac?
MR. BERGER: No. I can't speak about the meeting with Chirac, except to say that having gotten a description from the French official -- as I said, it was a very cordial meeting. Yeltsin basically clearly wanted it to not last long, and therefore, in a sense, wanted to set a date for a follow-up meeting with both the Germans and the French -- I believe in Paris, I'm not sure of that.
Q: What about the toast of the President?
MR. BERGER: Excuse me?
Q: What about the toast with the President?
MR. BERGER: Of Chirac and the President? I'm sorry. President Chirac and President Clinton sat next to each other at lunch, and were engaged in about an hour discussion on a range of subjects -- the Middle East and European security. But since I was not at the table, I can't give you very much of a readout from the meeting.
Q: Did President Yeltsin indicate any willingness to let relief agencies into Chechnya?
MR. BERGER: I think that's something that's being discussed by the ministers this afternoon.
Q: -- conversation between President Yeltsin and President Clinton?
MR. BERGER: No. President Clinton expressed our view that it's important, as he did again in his intervention in his statement at the session, that what we want to see here is an end to the violence against innocent civilians, the ability of people to return to their homes, access of relief organizations. He made those points again to President Yeltsin in the private meeting.
Q: Did the President ever say, look, this could cost Russia money in terms of loans in the future, loan guarantees?
MR. BERGER: Not in those terms. I think that -- quite honestly, I don't think that would be the most effective way to get them to change course at this point.
Q: Did President Yeltsin mention anything about how the prosecution of the war is affecting the popularity of the Prime Minister?
MR. BERGER: No.
Q: Could you talk a little bit about who is helping the Chechen -- the rebels, the separatists? Because I know Mr. Yeltsin's referred to them, and President Clinton appears to have referred to them. Who are these --
MR. BERGER: He spoke particularly of Islamic fundamentalist groups -- I'm using his description -- groups that are being supported by countries in the region. He didn't specifically indicate which countries. You know, we have, for example, some information that Osama bin Laden is supporting some of these people.
Q: The President tomorrow is traveling to Greece. Can you tell us what he is hoping to accomplish there, with Greece?
MR. BERGER: Well, we very much look forward to arriving in Greece. I think that, first of all, I think he wants to emphasize the dynamism of today's Greece. You know, 10 years ago Greece was the lowest-growth country, I believe, in the EU. It's now one of the most dynamic countries in the EU. And I think it's important for the President to underscore that, both for the international community and for the American people.
Second of all, we have a lot of bilateral issues with Greece. We have a strong, obviously, common interest in the Balkans, in what happens in the development of southeast Europe, in the development of Kosovo. Greeks have taken a very active role in those efforts.
Number three, as he has here in Turkey, I'm sure in Greece he will speak about the value of reconciliation between Greece and Turkey in general, and specifically with reference to the talks that now have been agreed to on Cyprus. So it will be a full agenda.
Q: Sandy, we didn't see him today. Can you give us a feeling on how he looked? Was he engaged? Did he seem healthy?
MR. BERGER: Yeltsin? Yes. He seemed in -- I couldn't really judge in the big meeting, because I was sitting at the other end of the room. But in the private meeting, the President said he had a firm handshake, and he was very vigorous, very energetic, very forceful. He has -- he still has a sense of humor, a mischievous sense of humor. And I thought physically he seemed quite good for a man who generally has a number of health problems that we know about.
Okay, thank you.

Bill Clinton,"November 19, 1999",Remarks Prior to Discussions With Prime Minister Bertie Ahern of Ireland and an Exchange With Reporters in Istanbul,"Northern Ireland Peace Process
President Clinton. Good morning. Let me say to all of you that I'm delighted to have this chance to meet with the Taoiseach and talk about the Irish peace process. I want to congratulate Prime Minister Ahern, Prime Minister Blair, and clearly, Senator Mitchell and the parties for the progress that has been made in the last few days. It's obvious that the parties have really worked hard to reaffirm their common commitment to the Good Friday accord, to hear each other's concerns, and then to develop a step-by-step plan to actually consummate this peace agreement. So I'm very hopeful, and I want to thank you for what you've done.
Prime Minister Ahern. Ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank the President for his interest in Irish matters this last 7 years. For the last 5 years, we have developed the Northern Ireland peace process. I particularly want to thank him for giving one of his best and trusted colleagues to Ireland, Senator George Mitchell. He has almost spent 5 years with us in one forum or another, and we thank him for that.
We particularly thank him for this third round of discussions this year, 11 weeks of intensive dialog, of comprehensive discussions, which he has chaired throughout. And can I add, I think a great part of the trust and the confidence which we could not generate earlier this year was assisted by the fact that we could use the United States Embassy in London which, I think, created a new confidence for the parties, and we appreciated that. And it allowed the parties to get away from the ordinary, run-ofthe-mill activities and to concentrate their minds. So that was a great help.
The reality is now, we're within a week or two of devolution of all the things that can bring the Good Friday agreement to reality. I just hope that all of the work that's been done by Senator Mitchell concluded yesterday successfully. I will now allow it to go forward.
And from the Irish Government's point of view, working in partnership with the British Government, with Tony Blair, working with the great assistance with the President, this is an opportunity which most people thought we'd never get. We have it now. It's for us to make it work. And I believe that the partnership government, working with the new institutions, the north-south bodies, it will allow us to go forward in peace and confidence and prosperity, and we appreciate that opportunity, President.
Decommissioning of Weapons
Q. Mr. President, the IRA statement yesterday made no mention of an actual turnover of weapons. Can there be a real peace until that happens?
President Clinton. Well, that is required by the Good Friday accord, and I think the fact that they have committed themselves to a process involving General de Chastelain and the decommissioning body indicates where this is going.
My sense is—and maybe Prime Minister Ahern would like to comment, he knows more than I do—but my sense is that both sides know what the other is going to say and do along this road and that this is the next step. And I thought it was an encouraging statement. It's certainly the most forthcoming the IRA has been as opposed to Sinn Fein, and so I think that we're moving in the right direction.
Prime Minister Ahern. What the President says is absolutely correct, and I think the IRA statement has to be read in conjunction with the Sinn Fein statement of the previous day. And the key aspect that people should remember is that last July, when Tony Blair and I tried to bring this to this stage of completion and did not succeed, it was the actions of an IRA statement. And the IRA, at that stage, had not agreed to put somebody working directly as an interlocutor with General de Chastelain. That has now been achieved.
Ulster Unionists
Q. Mr. President, Mr. Trimble of the Ulster Unionist Party still has to convince his party that this agreement with Senator Mitchell is worth going ahead with. Do you have any message for the Ulster Unionists?
President Clinton. Well, I think David Trimble has provided very strong and clear leadership. I don't think that he would be doing this if he didn't believe that ultimately all the provisions of the Good Friday accord would be honored. And I hope his party will stay with him, because he has been absolutely pivotal to this. And it's taken a lot of courage for him to take some of the decisions that he's taken, but because of that, we're on the verge of successful peace. And as I said, I am absolutely confident that he would not have agreed to any of this if he didn't think the whole Good Friday accord would be honored. And so I hope that he will receive the support of his party membership. I think they should stick with them, and I hope they will.
Press Secretary Joe Lockhart. Thank you very much.
President's Visit to Greece
Q. Mr. President, what do you think of the Greek Government's decision to ban protests during your visit to Athens?
President Clinton. I don't know that that's exactly the decision they made, so I can't comment until I'm absolutely sure that's what they did. I thought what they were trying to do is to do what a lot of countries do, which is to maintain some sort of distance between the protests and the subject of the protests. I don't believe they have banned them all.
Q. There seem to be some protests brewing there for your arrival, sir. What's your reaction to that, and——
President Clinton. First of all, I'm delighted to be going, and I'm not concerned about the protests. Greece and the United States have been great allies. They're very important to us. The Greek-American community is a very important part of our country, and the country has made absolutely astonishing progress over the last 10 years. And I would hope that this would be an opportunity for us to talk about what we have in common and where we're going.
I also think that the Greek people and the Government should be quite encouraged by this new Cyprus initiative and by the fact that I found a receptive ear here on three separate occasions when I spoke in Turkey about the necessity of the Turkish people and the Greeks being reconciled. So I know that a lot of people in Greece disagree with my position on Kosovo, and they have a right to their opinion, and I have a right to mine. I believe I was right, and I think that the facts have proved that I was right. But I don't mind. Greece is the world's oldest democracy. If people want to protest, they ought to have a chance to do it.
Situation in Chechnya
Q. Mr. President, do you think President Yeltsin might be changing course now on Chechnya by allowing an OSCE official to go and follow the political process?
President Clinton. Well, I think it's encouraging that the OSCE Chairman-in-Office has been invited there. I also think it's encouraging that this charter signing, which we're going to have in here in a few minutes, will be joined by Russia, because the charter specifically says that we do have to be concerned about internal affairs in other countries. So this is a significant move by Russia, and so these two things are encouraging.
Obviously, we've got a lot of turns in the road on Chechnya before it's resolved, but I would say that, compared to how things were when we all got here, those are two things that are hopeful.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-prior-discussions-with-prime-minister-bertie-ahern-ireland-and-exchange-with
Bill Clinton,"November 20, 1999",The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Konstandinos Simitis of Greece in Athens,"Prime Minister Simitis. Ladies and gentlemen, with very special pleasure, the Greek Government and the Greek people and I, personally, are welcoming President Clinton and the American delegation. This visit is confirming the historic friendship relations between the two countries and between our two people, a relationship that has been kept alive by the Greeks who have lived and are still living creatively in the United States, by the common struggles in other times, by our close relationship and partnership within the North Atlantic Alliance, political solidarity, and cooperation, our cooperation for our common goals.
With President Clinton, we had a very friendly, open, and free discussion. During our talks we covered all issues, those which under the present situation have a certain importance from our country, for going from Greek-American relations to developments in the Balkans, Greek-Turkish relations, and the Cyprus issue. We agreed, as regards Greek-American relations, that there is still considerable margin for the improvement of the cooperation between the two countries.
Greece, thanks to its economic renewal these last few years, provides new major opportunities for investments, trade relations, relations in the field of technology, and other areas. For the Balkans, our conviction is that the present situation entails certain risks. Stability is necessary in the region, respect of existing borders, and the strengthening of initiatives for the reconstruction of the region, and above all, the implementation of the Stability Pact.
As regards relations with neighboring Turkey, we have emphasized the need of deserving international law and international treaties and conventions. Rapprochement, steps towards rapprochement have been made recently. We believe that the most substantial answer is required on the part of Turkey to the initiatives of the Greek side.
We have agreed that Turkey's European perspective will help establish closer links based on peaceful development and cooperation. However, its candidature could not be accepted unless certain conditions are met for the settlement of existing problems. As regards the Cyprus issue, we have agreed that talks that have just started should be substantive in order to lead to the settlement of this issue.
The talks with the United States political leadership are, of course, self-understood. We have had a very interesting exchange of views, as I said, on all important issues for us. And we have also ascertained the friendly relations between the American and the Greek people, the close ties, not only at a political and economic levels but also at the levels of styles and culture where we believe our relations and cooperation should be extended. The friendship between our two peoples is confirmed by the substantial presence and role of a Greek community in the United States; successfully, it is making full use of all its rights as an American citizen.
Greece is a pole of democracy, political stability, social and political cohesion in the wider region. Its potential is much greater compared to the size of the country and its population. We have established that it is in the interest of both countries for our cooperation to safeguard and promote peace development and a network of relations in the region that would minimize tension, and this is why we will pursue and strengthen our cooperation with the United States.
This visit does not just confirm the past but also constitutes a guarantee for the future where, together, we can respond to the new challenges, the new challenges of a new era, of a new reality that is taking shape at the end of this century based on mutual understanding, equal cooperation, common resolve, and determination to face problems together, provide new answers, build on the values of democracy, freedom shared by our people, which are defended by our people, the values that we want to promote.
President Clinton. First of all, Prime Minister, let me thank you and the members of your government for the very good meeting that we had today. I think the Prime Minister has summarized the results of our meeting quite well. I would like to add just a few words.
First, the Greek relationship is profoundly important to me and to the United States because of the values and history we share; because of the large role Greek-Americans play in our national life, as the Prime Minister said. But also because of two historic transformations that have occurred in the last decade.
The first is the transformation of southeast Europe from a battleground between East and West to a proving ground for democracy and tolerance in the post-cold-war world. The second is the remarkable transformation of Greece itself into a regional leader with a booming economy, a vibrant democracy, with the ability to help to pull its neighbors together and push them forward into 21st century Europe.
We spoke a lot today about the role Greece is playing in the Balkans, with its troops in Bosnia and Kosovo, with its support for economic development and reconstruction, with its private sector investment. Greece is carrying a heavier burden in this region than almost any other country, but the potential payoff is very large: an undivided, democratic Europe, in which wars like those we've seen in the former Yugoslavia no longer happen. And I want to pay a tribute to the Prime Minister and the people of Greece for all they are doing in the Balkans and pledge my support for the Stability Pact and the economic growth necessary for this to work.
Of course, we also spoke about the road to reconciliation and lasting peace between Greece and Turkey and the issues in the Aegean and, of course, Cyprus. I told the Prime Minister how pleased I am that the parties in Cyprus have agreed to start these proximity talks on December 3d in New York, and how determined I am that they be serious talks. The goal is to lay the foundation for meaningful negotiations toward a comprehensive settlement. We should have no illusions; there's a tough road ahead. But we will work closely with Secretary-General Annan to ensure that the talks are productive.
We talked about our growing trade and investment, about how we can strengthen our economic relationship further. Greece's economic renewal has made it one of the most attractive places in Europe in which to do business. I am very pleased that its progress in improving protection for intellectual property rights makes it possible to move rapidly toward settling our copyright case in the WTO.
Finally, let me just express the great sympathy and support of the American people to all those who lost their loved ones in the tragic earthquake last August. We will not forget the heroism of the Greek emergency teams who pulled survivors from the rubble, not only here in Athens but also across the Aegean in Turkey. I am very glad that our own Federal Emergency Management Agency has agreed with its Greek counterparts to work together to strengthen their preparedness for future disasters.
Let me say in closing, I am satisfied with the work we advanced today. We look to, as I said last night, we look to ancient Greece for inspiration but to modern Greece for leadership and for partnership. After this visit, I believe we have strengthened that partnership.
Thank you very much.
Turkey's Candidacy for European Union Membership
Q. From what we know, you did ask while you were in Turkey for some specific move by Ankara that would match the moves Greece has done in order, also, to make her candidacy for the European Union easier. Do you have anything concrete on that?
President Clinton. Well, I didn't think that was my role. Let me tell you what I did do. I spoke both at every opportunity, publicly and privately, before the Turkish Assembly, before the business group, before the group of earthquake survivors, and in all my private meetings about the importance of resolving outstanding issues between Greece and Turkey, including Cyprus.
I specifically asked that the Halki seminary be reopened. I have pushed a lot of issues. And I came away believing that in the next few months, as all these issues are bubbling up—the start of the proximity talks, the debate over whether Turkey should be given candidacy status in the EU at Helsinki, and the continuing bilateral talks between Greece and Turkey, which I applaud the Prime Minister's government for his leadership in—that there will be an opportunity to resolve a large number of these issues.
I hope that my trip there was constructive in that regard. I believe it was. But I would not expect the Turkish leaders to let me be the conduit of their ultimate resolution of this. I think that I helped to improve the climate, and I dealt with a lot of the specific issues, and I feel good about that.
Prime Minister Simitis. Let me add two words for my part. During the meeting ahead with Mr. Ecevit and during Mr. Papandreou's meeting with Mr. Cem, we emphasized the need of certain movements and initiatives on the part of Turkey. And I believe that President Clinton's visit was important because he referred to that question, and it has helped, as well as the talks we had with the Turkish side on increasing awareness on the part of Turkey that things are not that easy. We cannot just expect for something to happen without doing or contributing anything for our part. You help yourself, and God will help you, as we say. We have to do something for our part, as well.
Greek Protests of President's Visit
Q. Sir, the demonstrations last night included extensive arson and damage. I want to know if you're concerned by the protests, and what you say to the Greeks who oppose your visit here?
President Clinton. What was the last part of your question?
Q. What's your message to the Greeks who are protesting, who oppose your visit here?
President Clinton. Well, first of all, I think that we have to—especially in Greece—reaffirm the right of people to protest in a democracy. Secondly, I strongly believe the protests should be peaceful, and therefore, I deeply regret the Greeks who had their property injured and who suffered losses through these demonstrations.
But I think that the important thing is that we reaffirm the value of the relationship between our two countries. I think that—I know most Americans deeply value the relationship with Greece, notwithstanding the fact that almost all of the people of Greece disagree with our policy in Kosovo and, before that, in Bosnia. I believe I did the right thing, and I think most Americans believe that we did the right thing to stand against ethnic cleansing.
But that doesn't affect our affection for and our support for the people of Greece and the Government of Greece. And I would hope that most Greek citizens would, like the Greek Government, believe that there is value in our relationship and our partnership; and that even if we have a disagreement, we can't allow that to undermine our relationship or our partnership.
I would just say, looking toward the future, I, personally, admire very much and support very strongly the leadership that Greece is exercising in the U.N. operations in Bosnia and in Kosovo and generally in the Balkans and throughout southeastern Europe. And I believe that if we can, the rest of us, do our part to help the economy grow there and provide a magnet that enables these nations to pull together, that Greece will lead them into a very different future in the new century.
Prime Minister Simitis. May I also point Greece is a country, a democratic country where everyone can freely express his views and opinions. But as we had emphasized before President Clinton's arrival, our Constitution provides that these expressions of opinions and views should be made in a peaceful way and within the context of legality. And I'm sorry for the fact that certain people did not observe and respect this fundamental principle of law, the fundamental principle that allows our states to operate and function.
The friendship, however, between the two people and the partnership, our partnership with the United States, will not be determined by these protests, but by our common goals, our common objectives and pursuits, our efforts to handle and face problems together. And the meeting today has shown that we share common goals and common pursuits, and we're trying together. This is the foundation of a friendship.
Turkey's Candidacy for European Union Membership
Q. Mr. President, I followed your trip in Ankara, and you seemed to be mostly the strongest supporter of Turkey's candidacy in the European Union. So do you think that the permanent conditionality of Turkey's candidacy should be, first, the solution of the Cyprus problem and, second, the acceptance of the jurisdiction of Turkey, as far as the Court of Hague is concerned?
President Clinton. I'm sorry, I'm not sure I understood the question. Could you repeat both questions again?
Q. Yes, one question actually. You seem to be the strongest supporter of Turkey's accession in the European Union. So the question is, do you believe or think that the permanent conditionality for Turkey's candidacy in the European Union should be, first, the solution of the Cyprus problem and, second, the acceptance of the jurisdiction of a Hague Court from Turkey?
President Clinton. Well, first of all, I believe—I have said this already—I believe that the disputes in the Aegean between Greece and Turkey should be referred to the International Court of Justice in The Hague or to some other mutually agreed on and generally recognized international dispute resolution mechanism. It seems to me that that is the only way that either side can have a resolution of this without appearing to cave in rather than just to let a neutral party, respected, decide it.
Secondly, I strongly support a resolution of the Cyprus issue. You're right. I am probably the strongest supporter in the West of Turkey's membership in the EU. I think I've also been the most vocal consistent supporter for 7 years of a resolution of Cyprus. I have worked as hard as I could on it and will continue to do so.
Now, when the parties meet in Helsinki, the members of the European Union—the United States is not a member—they will decide the conditions of Turkish candidacy if, in fact, they decide to grant Turkey candidacy.
But let me say, on the larger issue, my feeling is that the more Turkey is integrated into Europe and has the kind of dialog that we've seen recently with Greece, the more the climate improves, the more you can resolve these issues, the brighter the future for both countries will be. And as I told the Turks—I'm not saying anything to you I didn't say there—I do not think that bright future is achievable until there is a resolution of the Cyprus issue. These two countries need to go hand-in-hand into the future. And the festering disputes have to be resolved in order for that to happen.
Prime Minister Simitis. As I have indicated already, the Greek Government and I, personally, had a series of contacts. I have met and talked with all the Prime Ministers of the European Union member states on that issue. I have talked with them in order to determine what would be the best way that would allow us to overcome problems in the future. It would be counterproductive, I believe, if today, whilst these talks are ongoing, we were to focus on one or the other point or issue. This would not facilitate the discussion.
I believe that in the future the time will come for us to determine all these aspects. But at present, restriction to one or two or three issues is not helpful. We must have a global approach and look at the final aim of this overall effort.
Thank you.
U.S. Trade Policy and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas
Q. Mr. President, yesterday George W. Bush laid out his foreign policy priorities. Specifically on China and Russia, he said they should be viewed as competitors of the United States rather than as strategic partners. I'm wondering what your view is on that, and also, do you feel reassured that he has a view of the world that would make him an effective President?
President Clinton. You know, you guys keep trying to get me into this election. I am not a candidate. I'm not always happy about that, but I'm not.
Let me say this. I think we did the right thing to negotiate the WTO agreement with China, and apparently, Governor Bush agrees with that. I think that, as with all great countries, we are both competitors and partners. I think there is a problem with characterizing a country as a competitor if that means we know for sure that for the next 20 years there will be an adversary relationship.
We will have certain interests in common with China; we will have certain things we disagree with. We will support a lot of their domestic developments. We still have great trouble when people's free speech or religious rights are restrained.
With regard to Russia, we have a difference, as you know and the OSCE conference made clear, over the present policy in Chechnya, but we have a common interest in working together where we can. We have served side by side with Russian soldiers in the Balkans; we have seen the Russians withdraw their troops from the Baltics; we have seen a dramatic reduction in the nuclear capacity, the nuclear threat there. The Congress just gave us the funds to continue to reduce the nuclear threat with Russia. And we have worked with them on economic reform.
So I would say that in both cases there will be instances of competition, instances of partnership. But what we should be looking for is a world in which nations, including very large nations, define their greatness by the achievements of their people and by their ability to profit in their relations with other nations by bringing out the best in them, instead of by the traditional 19th and 20th century great power politics terms of defining their greatness in terms of their ability to dominate their neighbors or coerce certain people into certain kinds of behavior.
So I think we have to imagine—I have a whole different view of this—we should imagine what would we like the world to look like 50 years from now. What major countries will have an impact on that? How will we compete with them? How will we cooperate with them? What can we do that will most likely create the world we want for our grandchildren? That's the way I look at this. So I don't have an either/or view of Russia or China. I have a both view, I suppose.
Prime Minister Simitis. May I make a philosophical comment on this? We should not be afraid of competitors. We should be afraid of ourselves when we are afraid of others.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-prime-minister-konstandinos-simitis-greece-athens
Bill Clinton,"November 22, 1999",Exchange With Reporters Prior to Discussions With President Petar Stoyanov of Bulgaria in Sofia,"President Clinton. Good morning.
Q. How are you, Mr. President?
President Clinton. I'm fine. I'm delighted to be here, very pleased.
Situation in Chechnya
Q. Mr. President, the events in Chechnya in the last 2 days, has that raised doubts about the Russian commitment to a political dialog?
President Clinton. Well, I think they made clear that they were going to try to continue their military offensive. What we've done at the OSCE is it got them to agree that the internal affairs of Russia or any other country is a proper subject of world discussion and world opinion. We got them to agree to take the OSCE mission there. I think it's very important to do that. And I hope that we've gotten an increased amount of concern for civilian casualties. So we'll have to see, but I think it's very important we follow up on the commitments made earlier at the OSCE meeting in Istanbul.
Q. Mr. President, Bulgarian national television. Are you going to discuss with our President different ways for compensating Bulgaria for our losses during the embargo against Yugoslavia and Iraq, about $10 billion?
President Clinton. Well, first of all, let me say I'm very grateful for the support we received, the Allies received during the conflict in Kosovo, and for the direction taken by Bulgaria under this President and this Government. And we are committed to supporting Bulgaria over the long run, economically, politically, militarily. And I think we will be doing it for many years, and I'm looking forward to that.
Situation in Kosovo
Q. Mr. President, in Kosovo tomorrow, will you urge ethnic Albanians to stop their reprisal attacks against Serbs?
President Clinton. In Kosovo tomorrow I will make a very strong statement about the importance of everybody getting over this ethnic hatred and going beyond it. And we have all made a big commitment to Kosovo as an economic and political reconstruction. But I think it's very important that Kosovo, in effect, not become the mirror image of Serbia. It's hard not to, but it's important not to. And we'll keep working on it.
But I wouldn't overreact to the stories, you know, and the facts—a lot of good things have happened there since the end of the war. And it hasn't been very long, and there is a long, long history in Kosovo and throughout Serbia, throughout the Balkans, that we're trying to get beyond.
Again, I'd say Bulgaria is a very good example of the direction we ought to take, and I hope we can have a positive impact in Kosovo. I think we can.
President Stoyanov. It's important that we, through the American people, through the eyes of the American President, the American people will realize that the Bulgarian people have embarked upon a new road and chosen a new policy, that of democracy, of respect for human rights and that, also, through its wonderful relations with all its neighbors and its excellent ethnic—the absence of ethnic problems whatsoever, Bulgaria will be an example of stability on this continent and will continue to be so.
NATO Bases in Bulgaria
Q. Will you inform us if you discuss the issue of NATO bases in this country?
President Stoyanov. We'll inform you about anything with pleasure, with the greatest of pleasure.
President Clinton. Thank you.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/exchange-with-reporters-prior-discussions-with-president-petar-stoyanov-bulgaria-sofia
Bill Clinton,"November 24, 1999",Remarks at the Thanksgiving Turkey Presentation Ceremony and an Exchange With Reporters,"The President. Please sit down, everyone. Welcome to this annual day-before-Thanksgiving ritual here at the White House. I want to welcome particularly the Boys and Girls Clubs from Greater Washington, Horton's Kids, the people from the National Turkey Federation, and especially Chairman Jim Rieth and the president, Stuart Proctor.
I also want to say a special word of welcome to Representative Peter Deutsch from Florida and his family, who are here. This is a triumph of human stamina, because Peter just made the trip with me to Bulgaria and Kosovo. We got back very late last night, so he promised to come so there would be two jet-lagged people standing here together, and we're glad to see them.
I want to thank, as always, the National Turkey Federation for donating this year's tom turkey. It traveled here all the way from Minnesota. Minnesota may be the second biggest turkeyproducing State in our country. Sometimes I wonder if it's really a match for Washington, DC. [Laughter]
Tomorrow we celebrate the last Thanksgiving of this century. A hundred years ago, on these very grounds, President William McKinley reflected on the last turn of the century. He said, ""Seldom has this Nation had greater cause for profound thanksgiving."" Those words ring even more true today.
Today we count among our national blessing a time of unprecedented prosperity, with expanding economy, low rates of poverty and unemployment among our people, limitless opportunities for our children and the future. We are also very grateful for the peace and freedom America continues to enjoy, thanks to our men and women in uniform—many of whom I saw yesterday—a very long way from home at Thanksgiving.
As we gather around our dinner tables tomorrow with family and friends, let us give thanks for all these things that hold us together as a people: the duty we owe to our parents and our children; the nurturing and education of our families, especially our children, and for many, our grandchildren; the bounty of our earth; and the strong spirit of community we enjoy here in the United States.
We also know as we celebrate our blessings that there are still too many people who are hungry at this holiday season, both beyond our borders and around the world and, sadly, even here in the United States. That's why it's so important that we not only give thanks but also give back to our communities.
Before coming out here, I asked some of our staff members what they were thankful for this holiday season. One of my staff members said, ""Today I'm thankful that I'm not a turkey."" [Laughter] I know that one turkey doesn't have to worry about that. This fine-looking bird from the State of Minnesota. At over 50 pounds, he is the namesake of Harry S. Truman, the President who began the tradition of keeping at least one turkey off the Thanksgiving dinner table. Harry, the turkey, will get his pardon today.
So before I feast on one of the 45 million turkeys who will make the ultimate sacrifice, let me give this one a permanent reprieve, and tell you all that he will soon be on his way to the wonderful petting zoo at Fairfax County, Virginia, where he can enjoy his golden years.
I want to say a special word of appreciation for the people who run this petting zoo and who give, therefore, a lot of children the opportunity to see animals and to touch them in a way that they never would.
Just before we came out here—or before we started the ceremony, Stuart reminded me that this turkey is a little more calm than the one we had last year. One of the most interesting things I've discovered in the 7 years we've done this is that turkeys really do have personalities, very different ones. And most all of them have been quite welcoming to the President and to the children who want to pet them. On occasion, they're as independent as the rest of Americans. [Laughter]
So, Harry, you've got your pardon. Ladies and gentlemen, Happy Thanksgiving.
Vieques Island
Q. Mr. President, on Vieques, how are you going with reaching a compromise with Governor Rossello´ with regard to Vieques?
The President. Well, we're working very hard on it, and the Defense Department and the Government of Puerto Rico have been working together. And here's a case where I believe there are two legitimate issues here. There's the legitimate concerns of the people of Puerto Rico, which I think are quite real, particularly the people on the island. And then there's the absolutely legitimate concern of sending all of our units out combat-ready. So we're working hard through that.
I have spent a lot of time on it myself, and I hope that in the next few days, we'll have something to say about it. We're getting there.
Hillary Clinton's Senate Campaign
Q. What did you think of your wife's emphatic statement, Mrs. Clinton's emphatic statement yesterday regarding the Senate race? And did you advise her to do that?
The President. Well, I think—first of all, I thought it was a good statement. I thought she did well yesterday. And what told—what she said in public is what she's been telling me for weeks and weeks, and I think she just thought that, even though, for a lot of good reasons, she thought she should wait until next year to make a formal announcement, I thought it was a wise thing for her to do, to decide that—to make it clear that she had no doubt that she was going to do it.
Q. Are you, in a sense, prepared to not have a First Lady here? Are you prepared to do many of the things, in a sense, that she might do?
The President. Well, I want her to do this if she wants to do it—and she does—and if a lot of people in New York want her to do it—and they do. And I think that we'll have to make accommodations. She'll be here and do some things, and some things that she might otherwise do she won't. But I'm excited for her, and if I can help her in any way, I will. I think it's wonderful.
Q. Did she sense that many people in New York were concerned, many Democrats especially in New York were concerned about her veracity—that's the only word——
The President. You mean about whether she was serious about running?
Q. Whether she was serious.
The President. Well, I think that there are a lot of people who kept saying that, and apparently there was some concern, so I thought it was a good thing to clear it up. I always think if there's any doubt and you can resolve it, you ought to do it. So I think she did that, and I'm proud of her.
Vieques Island
Q. Mr. President, how soon will you hear from Secretary Cohen on Vieques? Today or Friday?
Q. What kind of a race do you think she'll have? Do you think it's going to be tough?
The President. I don't know. We've worked hard on this. I think largely the timing will be determined by the facts, that is all the issues that are out there that we're still working through. Because I feel very strongly that the people of Puerto Rico have some legitimate concerns, not only just on the facts here but on the whole relationship since 1983 with the military. I think that Secretary Cohen and Secretary Danzig were very concerned about it. They've been extremely responsive, and I think everyone has worked hard in good faith here.
I must say, I've been very impressed by the work of—and the approach that Governor Rossello´ and Congressman Romero-Barcelo´ have had, and also the people at Defense. We've really worked hard on this in a good spirit. And like I said, I've spent an awful lot of time on it myself. And I hope we can get it worked out. I'm not sure—I can't say for sure we will, but we're making real headway, and we're working hard.
Hillary Clinton's Senate Campaign
Q. What will be your role in your wife's campaign?
The President. Well, I don't have any idea yet. I think—I'll try to do for her what she's always done for me. I'll try to give her good advice. But I've got a job here, and I'm going to do it. And I also think that in the beginning of the campaign the people want to see her. They want to know what she's going to do and how she's going to do it and what she can do if the New York citizens decide to put her to work for them. But if there's some way I can help, I'll be happy to.
I think she's got a lot to offer and I think——
Q. Have you established your residency in terms of where you're going to——
The President. Well, I suppose that is, strictly speaking, a legal question. But we have a home there, and we're working on getting it furnished. Then she'll have a place to be when she's up there campaigning and not here in the White House. So I think we're on our way to doing that. But I'm excited about the house; it's a pretty house.
Drug Enforcement Agency Practices in Mexico
Q. Mr. President, with Mexico—the DEA agents in Mexico were intercepted by narcotraffickers, and they found guns in their car. That is an illegal matter in Mexico, DEA agents carrying guns in Mexico. Are you concerned with the security of those agents working in Mexico, and what are you doing to resolve these kinds of violations of international problems with Mexico?
The President. You know, I just got back from a 10-day trip. I haven't been briefed, and I don't think I can comment now. I'm sorry.
President's Possible Visit to India
Q. Mr. President, are you ready to travel to India now, after traveling the whole world? And the Ambassador of India here in Washington said that now it's overdue for President Clinton to travel to India.
The President. I've always planned to go there, and I hope I can.
Q. The First Lady, when she visited there, said that ""I'll bring my husband.""
The President. Yes. Well, I certainly intend to go, and I hope we can work it out.
Colombia and Narcotrafficking
Q. For the first time in over 9 years is a citizen of Colombia and nationality to the United States—President Pastrana—do you feel this is a good step? Will this help you——
The President. It's a very, very good step, and a courageous step on his part, and real evidence that we're committed to working together to fight the narcotics trade. I think you will see early next year, on a completely bipartisan basis, an effort by the United States to do more to assist Colombia across a whole broad range of issues. Colombia is already the third largest recipient of American assistance, but it's a very large country with a very old tradition and a lot of profound challenges. And I think you will see next year that we'll be out there together—Republicans and Democrats alike— trying to be good partners with the people in Colombia that are trying to build a safe, decent, harmonious society.
Q. Happy Thanksgiving, Mr. President.
The President. Happy Thanksgiving.
Seattle Round
Q. Going to Seattle, sir, are you disappointed that other leaders aren't going?
The President. Originally, it was just supposed to be a ministerial, and I thought—just almost at the last minute, I thought, well, since I'm going to be out there a day and a half or a day, that if anybody wants to come, other people who are interested in this, I ought to give them a chance to come. But I think we decided to do it so late, it was just more of a logistical problem than anything else. So, no.
Q. Did you try to talk——
The President. No. No, we just explored whether they wanted to come because I was going to be there. But it was just something done, literally, at the last minute. It was originally supposed to be a ministerial, and I thought, well, gosh, I don't want them to think that I'm out there, and they're not welcome. That's all.
President's Visit to Turkey and Southeastern Europe
Q. Are you dead tired? Are you dead tired?
The President. No, I had a nice—good night's sleep last night. It was a wonderful trip for America. You know, what we did—I think we made some real progress with Greece and Turkey. I think that the pipeline that we signed is a great insurance policy for democracies everywhere, including the United States. I think the fact that we got an agreement for a new charter for the OSCE, where the Russians acknowledged the legitimacy of all nations being concerned about internal affairs within countries, I think is good. I think the fact that we got an agreement on military forces in Europe which will get the Russian forces out of Georgia and Moldova, and also give them the security of knowing there are certain limits on how many foreign forces can be established in other countries, I think all those things are quite good.
So this was a big trip for the United States; long term, our security was substantially advanced. And I hope and pray and believe that we really made some progress on helping Greece and Turkey to work out their differences and moving Turkey toward membership in the European Union. That's what I hope.
Q. The Russians out of Chechnya—do you think the Russians——
DEA Practices in Mexico
Q. [Inaudible]—an agreement to allow the agents to carry weapons?
The President. I just told this gentleman, I just got back last night, and I got back very late, and I haven't been briefed on a lot of this. So I think, before I comment on that, I should have a chance to talk.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-thanksgiving-turkey-presentation-ceremony-and-exchange-with-reporters
Bill Clinton,"December 06, 1999",Remarks on Presenting the Eleanor Roosevelt Award for Human Rights,"The President. Thank you very much, Belquis. Congressmen Gilman, Lewis, Jackson Lee; Reverend and Mrs. Jackson; Deputy Attorney General Holder; Harold Koh; Bob Seiple; Julia Taft; Hattie Babbitt; Bette Bao Lord, thank you for coming back.
School Shooting in Fort Gibson, Oklahoma
Ladies and gentlemen, before I begin, I need—because this is my only opportunity before the press today just to say a brief word about this school shooting this morning in Fort Gibson, Oklahoma. The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms are on the scene now working with the local authorities. I expect to get a detailed briefing shortly. Meanwhile, our prayers are with each of the children and their families, and the entire Fort Gibson community is—right now there are no fatalities, only people who are wounded, and we hope and pray it will stay that way.
Eleanor Roosevelt Award for Human Rights
It occurs to me that at some point tonight someone will be doing what some of us—Hillary says it's mostly a male thing—somebody will be channel-surfing tonight. [Laughter] And they will just come upon Belquis speaking. And they may stop and listen, or they may not. They may know what the Taliban is, or they may not. But I wonder if even someone who hears her will recognize that in nearly half the world today—in spite of the fact that for the first time in history more than half the people of the world live under governments of their own choosing—in nearly half the world, doing what Belquis just did, simply standing up and speaking freely, could get her arrested, jailed, beaten, even tortured. That's why we're here today.
I wonder if someone who just happened along her remarks tonight would understand that until people like Eleanor Roosevelt came along, the rest of the world didn't even recognize that the right to speak out is more than something enshrined in the American Constitution. It is truly an international human right.
Sometimes we forget how long it took the world to agree on a common definition, a universal declaration of what freedom actually means. Half a century ago the Universal Declaration on Human Rights said it in very simple words: ""All human beings are free and equal in dignity and human rights. All have the right to life, liberty, and security. All are endowed with reason and conscience. All have the right to a standard of living adequate to health and well-being.""
The real genius of the Declaration of Human Rights is that it affirmed that basic human rights are not cultural, but universal; that what a country does to people within its own borders is not its business alone, but the business of all of us. We in the United States know how hard it is to achieve the aspirations of that declaration. We've been living with it since our Founders, and living with our flaws in failing to meet up to its standards.
A hundred years ago Eleanor Roosevelt was a 15-year-old girl growing up in a country where women could not vote. Half a century ago, if the standards of the Universal Declaration were held up to segregated schools and lunch counters in the United States, we would have failed the test resoundingly.
This century has taught us that even though human rights are endowed by the hand of our Creator, they are ensured by the hearts and hands of men and women among us who cannot bear to see it otherwise. Inch by inch, such people have moved the world forward. Today we honor five brave Americans whose lives have made a difference. And we ask that all of us remember, in their triumphs, the struggles of people like Belquis, the continuing tensions in Africa, the continuing tensions in the Balkans, and elsewhere in the world where human rights are not yet secure.
It is said that when Burke Marshall first met Robert Kennedy, they sat across a table for 10 minutes and didn't say a single word. Those of us who had Burke Marshall in law school can believe that story. [Laughter] Perhaps now he will tell us who spoke first. But from that silent moment sprang a truly extraordinary partnership.
As Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division in the Kennedy administration, Burke Marshall was a bridge between Government and those activists fighting every day to end Jim Crow. Congressman John Lewis, who received this award last year, once recalled that whenever Martin Luther King or James Farmer needs to talk to somebody in Washington— needed to talk to someone in Washington, they would simply say, ""call Burke.""
His work was crucial to passing the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act. After he had helped shape a new America, he later worked equally hard to shape young minds at Yale Law School.
I made a joke about Hillary and I being students. But I can tell you, I never will forget the first time I saw him. And I imagined how this man of slight stature and such a modest demeanor could almost shake with his passion for justice. It was quite something to see for the first time, and we are all in his debt.
When Leon Sullivan was 8 years old, he walked into a grocery store, slapped a nickel on the counter and said, ""I want a Coke."" The place being in segregated South Carolina, the shopkeeper threw him out. That moment was the beginning of his life's work. The pastor of two churches by the time he was at the ripe old age of 17, Reverend Sullivan went on to write the Sullivan principles, which called upon companies all around the world to act in a socially responsible manner. By compelling dozens of businesses to desegregate their plants in South Africa, his work helped to pull down apartheid.
Today, as the author of the new global Sullivan principle, Leon Sullivan is still changing the world. He's too big for anyone to deny him a Coke—[laughter]—but he has helped to win that right for millions of others who aren't so large.
Reverend Sullivan, thank you for keeping your eyes on the prize for nearly 80 years now. Thank you.
For those of you who wonder from time to time about whether there really could be a divine plan guiding our lives, consider this: In Spanish, the name, Dolores Huerta, means ""sorrowful orchard."" But if Dolores has her way, her name will be the only sorrowful orchard left in America.
She began her career teaching young migrant children but couldn't stand seeing them come to class hungry. So in 1962 she and Cesar Chavez cofounded the United Farm Workers. While Cesar Chavez worked the fields, she worked the boardrooms and the statehouses, negotiating contracts and fighting for laws that lifted the lives of thousands and thousands of Americans. In the process, she found time to raise 11 children.
Dolores, we thank you for all you have done and all you still do to promote the dignity and human rights of your family and America's family. Thank you.
It is no accident that when America opened its arms to Kosovar Albanians early this year, one of the first calls that went out was to a Dominican nun in the Fordham section of the Bronx. Scripture tells us that ""if you spend yourselves on behalf of the hungry and satisfy the needs of the oppressed, then your life will rise in the darkness and your night will become like noonday."" If that is true, there are few people who live their lives in more sunshine than Sister Jean Marshall.
Disturbed by the sight of refugee families picking up garbage off the street to feed their children, in 1983 Sister Jean founded St. Rita's Center for Immigrant and Refugee Services. In the days since, it has helped thousands of refugees, from Vietnam to Cambodia to Bosnia, to find jobs, learn English, live better lives.
Sister Jean, we thank you for all you are doing to make our democracy real and dreams come true for thousands who flee human rights abuses and come here expecting the Statue of Liberty to live up to her promise. Thank you.
Lastly, there are few people who have done more to directly build on Eleanor Roosevelt's work on women's rights around the world than Charlotte Bunch. Gloria Steinem once observed that for every question that comes up regarding women's rights, sooner or later someone asks, what does Charlotte think? [Laughter]
As the founder of the Center for Women's Global Leadership at Rutgers University, she has worked to build a worldwide network of activists. As a result, when the World Conference on Human Rights was held in Vienna in 1993, for the first time there was a network in place to raise international awareness of issues like violence against women and gay and lesbian issues. And for the first time, the U.N. acknowledged that women's rights are human rights.
Today I think the best way to thank Charlotte Bunch is for the Senate to finally ratify the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. Thank you.
We honor these five Americans today with the thanks of a grateful nation. But let me say again, to echo what Hillary said earlier, if we truly want to honor their work, we must stay committed in the places where the glory has not come and continue to speak out for human rights around the world, from Burma to Cuba to Sudan, from Serbia to North Korea and Vietnam. We must do so because it's the right thing to do and the surest path to a world that is safe, democratic, and free.
In Afghanistan, we have strongly condemned the Taliban's despicable treatment of women and girls. We have worked with the United Nations to impose sanctions against the Taliban, while ensuring that the Afghan people continue to receive humanitarian assistance. We are Afghanistan's strongest critic, but also its largest humanitarian donor.
And today we take another step forward. I am pleased to announce that we will spend, next year, at least $2 million to educate and improve the health of Afghan women and children refugees. We are also making an additional $1 1/2 million available in emergency aid for those displaced by the recent Taliban offensive. And we're dramatically expanding our resettlement program for women and children who are not safe where they are.
But, as Belquis said, these are but temporary solutions. The Taliban must stop violating the rights of women and respect the human rights of all people. And we must continue to work until the day when Afghanistan has a government that reflects the wisdom of its people.
The whole world is also concerned about the plight of innocent people in Chechnya. Two weeks ago, at the OSCE summit in Turkey, I raised the issue directly with President Yeltsin. The people of Chechnya are in a terrible position, beleaguered by paramilitary groups and terrorists on the one hand and the Russian offensive on the other. I made clear that Russia's fight against terrorism is right, but the methods being used in Chechnya are wrong. And I am convinced they are counterproductive.
We've seen rocket and artillery attacks on largely civilian areas, with heavy losses of life and at least 200,000 people pushed from their homes. I'm deeply disturbed by reports that suggest that innocent Chechens will continue to bear the brunt of this war, and not the militants Russia is fighting.
Russia has set a deadline for all inhabitants, now, to leave Grozny or face the consequences. That means that there is a threat to the lives of the old, the infirm, the injured people, and other innocent civilians who simply cannot leave or are too scared to leave their homes. Russia will pay a heavy price for those actions with each passing day, sinking more deeply into a morass that will intensify extremism and diminish its own standing in the world.
Another country about which we must continue to express concern is China. China is progressing and opening to the world in many ways that are welcome, including its entry into the WTO. Yet its progress is still being held back by the Government's response to those who test the limits of freedom. A troubling example, of course, is the detention by Chinese authorities, of adherents of the Falun Gong movement.
Its targets are not political dissidents, and their practices and beliefs are unfamiliar to us. But the principle still, surely, must be the same: freedom of conscience and freedom of association. And our interest, surely, must be the same: seeing China maintain stability and growth at home by meeting, not stifling, the growing demands of its people for openness and accountability.
For all these challenges, we have to say that we enter the new millennium more hopeful than we have been at any time in the past century. The second half of this century began with delegates from 18 nations, including the United States, coming together to write the Universal Declaration. The century ends with 18 nations having come together with the United States to reaffirm those basic rights in Kosovo—with progress from Indonesia and East Timor to Nigeria.
Now, as I've said, more than half the world's people live under governments of their own choosing. Shortly before the Congress went home, the United States Senate unanimously ratified the International Convention against Child Labor, and I became the third head of state to sign the convention. We are moving, but we have much to do as we enter a new century. And again I would say to my fellow Americans, we all know that our efforts have to begin at home.
On the 10th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Eleanor Roosevelt dedicated a book called ""In Your Hands."" On that day she said, and I quote, human rights begin ""in small places, close to home . . . Unless these rights have meaning there, they have little meaning anywhere. Without concerted citizen action to uphold them close to home, we shall look in vain for progress in the larger world.""
Today we honor that message by honoring five people whose work close to home has made the whole world a better place. May their work continue to inspire us all for generations yet to come.
Lieutenant Colonel, read the citations.

The President. Thank you for coming. Thank you for honoring these great people. Thank you for reminding us of all the important work still to be done, Belquis.
We're adjourned. Thank you.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-presenting-the-eleanor-roosevelt-award-for-human-rights
Bill Clinton,"December 07, 1999",Press Briefing by Joe Lockhart,"The Briefing Room
1:07 P.M. EST
MR. LOCKHART: I open it to your questions.
Q: Joe, the Russians said that they were providing a safe corridor for civilians to leave Grozny, but apparently they have not stopped bombarding the city, so people are afraid to leave their houses. Has this changed the administration's view in terms of what it can or should do?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, I think, as the President addressed directly yesterday, we have made the case to them, both publicly and privately, that we don't believe a military solution can be imposed here, and that they need to open a dialogue.
There's some movement on the OSCE mission, but we've made it very clear, as I think the entire international community has, how much concern the international community has about their recent actions, that is only deepened by the events of the last few days.
Q: What are the consequences?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, the consequences are, this is damaging to Russia; they further face isolation within the international community. The results of this, we believe, potentially are counterproductive, hardening the resistance of the terrorist efforts in Chechnya. And I think we have made clear on many occasions, now, how counterproductive we find their policy to be.
Q: But what will the U.S. do, Joe? What will the U.S. do if this continues?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, we will continue to make the case to them on how counterproductive this is. I'm not going to get into any specifics of any action we might take down the road. We will continue to make decisions based on what we think our national security interests are.
Q: Why should the Russians not simply conclude that the only price they pay is rhetorical, because the United States has done nothing on IMF loans, has done nothing on -- which we support to Russia. I mean, we're not even talking about doing those things?
MR. LOCKHART: What's going on on IMF loans? I mean, examine your question -- what's going on on IMF loans?
Q: Hasn't the United States opposed the granting of further IMF loans to Russia?
MR. LOCKHART: IMF loans are blocked right now, which we support based on other considerations. It hasn't even come to that so I think you can, in your own way, develop a rhetorical device that has no meaning here. We have made the case, but we are ultimately going to make our decisions based on what our national security interests -- if you look at the aid that we provide to Russia, the vast majority of it is to make our life safer. The vast majority of that aid goes to reducing their nuclear threat, and I don't know at this point -- the productivity of removing that assistance. I also don't know the productivity of removing the assistance we give to democratic institutions outside of Moscow that promote democracy.
Again, I don't think this is a situation where you want to undermine your own national security to make some sort of statement.
Q: What happened at the Robertson meeting?
MR. LOCKHART: The Robertson meeting -- they discussed -- as I previewed this morning, they had a discussion on the situation in Chechnya, shared mutual concern there. Also talked about the European Security Defense Initiative, an extensive discussion on Kosovo, the situation with KFOR and the United Nations mission there, and as I mentioned this morning, the President reviewed our current thinking on national missile defense and our ability to work with the ABM Treaty.
Q: Joe, what's the current thinking on how long troops will have to -- American and other troops will have to stay in Kosovo?
MR. LOCKHART: I don't have any update beyond -- we, I think, learned in Bosnia that setting a hard and fast timeline is not the right way to move forward. They will be there as long as it takes to get the mission accomplished.
Q: Has the President made up his mind now on SDI? Is he definitely going ahead?
MR. LOCKHART: A national missile defense decision will be made later next year, based on the feasibility, the technology, the cost, and there's no decision -- and the threat, obviously.
Q: What was Robertson's attitude? Do you know what Robertson said?
MR. LOCKHART: I'll leave it to Lord Robertson to express his views.
Q: When you say get the mission accomplished, what is the mission at this point? What would be accomplishing the mission?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, they're providing peacekeeping support right now. We are moving in a transition between the KFOR mission and the United Nations mission for restoring basic elements and components of self-government. That process will go on for some time, and I'm not in a position to predict how long that will take.
Q: Were you saying before with regard to Russia that there's not a lot that we can do specifically to influence their behavior?
MR. LOCKHART: No, I wasn't. I just was responding to a question that was asked of me on particular issues.
Q: Is there a lot we can do?
MR. LOCKHART: I think that there is a lot that the United States can do and the international community can do as far as indicating to them how strongly we feel about this. But, again, I don't see the utility in getting into any specific steps that may or may not be taken.
Q: But in terms of withholding aid or sanctions, it seems to me that you're indicating that there isn't a lot that we can do.
MR. LOCKHART: I'm telling you that we'll make our decisions based on our national security interests, what we'll do on aid, what we'll do on sanctions. Right now, the IMF is holding up economic aid based on purely economic issues. When those are satisfied, I don't know -- I mean, it's trying to look into the future on what decisions may or may not be made.
As far as the bilateral aid that's given, we've indicated what -- you know what that aid is for. And I don't know that it makes sense at this point to stop efforts to reduce the nuclear threat to this country in order to make a statement on another issue.
Q: Does the President believe that there's a form of ethnic cleansing going on in Chechnya now?
MR. LOCKHART: I think the President's very concerned about the humanitarian plight of the people of Chechnya who are being in some places moved, in some places being kept from moving. I don't know that it fits the pure model of ethnic cleansing. But the distinction is probably lost on those who are facing a humanitarian crisis.
Q: Given the outcome of the WTO in Seattle last week, how do you move forward selling China's admission up on the Hill, particularly with the insistence on labor standards, and their own record on that subject?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, we move forward by making the case directly on why it's in the interests of U.S. business, U.S. families, why it's in the interest of continuing to sustain the remarkable and unprecedented economic growth, and why we think it's in the interest of trying to integrate China into the international community. That effort has already begun, and will continue from now until the day of the vote.
Q: Joe, you indicated yesterday when you announced the plans for the news conference that the President wants to talk about the agenda for the coming year. Considering the makeup of Congress and other political reality -- the increasing lame-duck status, and the campaign year -- what realistically do you think are the prospects that the President's wish list is going to go anywhere?
MR. LOCKHART: I think one of the things that we've all learned here is not to worry too much about the labels and the predictions. We joke that there are a lot of people who write and are scribes and pundits in this town, who wrote us off after the first two weeks in the administration. So the President has an aggressive agenda which he will articulate both in his budget and his State of the Union early in January and February, early in the year. They will be issues that you've heard before, some are familiar as far as extending Social Security and modernizing Medicare, moving on issues that we did not finish this year, like gun control, patients bill of rights, and he'll have a number of new initiatives that he'll outline in the State of the Union. So I think he's very anxious to get moving with next year's agenda, and optimistic that we can get a lot of work done.
Q: Was the date for the press conference scheduled, or at least tentatively scheduled before the WTO meeting, or was it --
MR. LOCKHART: No, it was about two weeks ago that we settled on the day. We had committed to do one more before the year was over.
Q: The President, in the past, has often, when he's had a setback, generally he'll come right out and either hold a press conference or something like that. Will he be talking about WTO in his opening remarks?
MR. LOCKHART: I doubt that it will be central to the opening remarks, but I certainly anticipate that there will be a question or two.
Q: What will his remarks be about?
MR. LOCKHART: We're still working on it.
Q: The President did not seem to want to deal with the Cuba question. A deadline has been imposed by --
MR. LOCKHART: The President did not want to take any of the suspense and enjoyment out of tomorrow's hour he's going to spend with all of you.
Q: What is the United States reaction to this threat by Castro to take unspecified --
MR. LOCKHART: The same as I articulated yesterday. We will make decisions here based on what the laws of this country indicate -- also based on the best interests of the young man in question. We do not respond to the kind of threats that Castro has engaged in, and we also made quite clear that we hold him responsible for the safety of Americans who are in Cuba.
Q: Does the political nature of this case suggest that it may be prudent to have some involvement by Washington and not leave it entirely to the state of Florida?
MR. LOCKHART: I don't think that is has been left to the state of Florida. This is now at the INS, they are going through the process, this is a unique case, but it is not one that they are not equipped to deal with. They have a process that we're dealing with. I know they will be talking to the parties and communicating to the interested parties relatively soon about how this can potentially move forward.
If you listened this morning to the U.S.-based lawyers for the family, they've indicated they would like to work this out within the family. That is a possibility. There is a possibility it could be worked out within the context of the INS. Or it may have to go to a state court if there are joint custody claims. This is something that has not played out. But the INS is working through their process, and will do it based on their procedures, based on our law, and not based on some threat from an outside force.
Q: Joe, we have an agreement with Cuba, as I understand, the migration agreement says basically that if someone reaches the U.S. shore on their own, they're allowed to stay; if they're picked up at sea, they're returned to Cuba. Why was there an exception in this case?
MR. LOCKHART: Because from time to time, the INS makes exceptions. And I would go to the INS for the particulars of why they've made this decision. But from this point on, there's a procedure that the INS follows. And it will be done based on their rules, based on our laws. And eventually, it may have to be adjudicated in a state court. It may not, though.
Q: But this is an agreement the administration signed with Cuba, not that the INS signed with Cuba. So I'm asking, is the administration satisfied with the way this was handled, and does it believe an exception was made in this case, in that the normal procedure was not followed?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, in this particular case, as you remember, there was -- not only for the young man, I think, for some of the others -- there was a need for emergency medical care. That is certainly, I think, understandable by all rational parties.
Now we're in a situation where we have to go through a procedure that the INS does -- again, this is a somewhat unique case. It's not something that's in the ordinary order of business. But they have a procedure that they will follow. They will communicate with interested parties soon about how they'll move forward. And this can resolve itself in a number of ways of which we don't know at this point.
Q: But they've given him parole, so he's allowed to stay here for the moment. What is the INS role in sort of-- you make it sound like they're mediating between his father in Cuba and the families in --
MR. LOCKHART: No, I think they will work through the issues of how to deal with the young man, but they will do it in a way that allows interested parties to understand the process and how they're going to move forward. And, again, as has been widely discussed, there is some possibility that they're could be a legal custody claim that might involve the state court. But, again, there's nothing that's been filed.
I think there is a temptation to get a little ahead of ourselves here on how this will play out. I can only tell you that the INS is working this and will be in touch with the families.
Q: What is the INS decision that has to be made now? What is the next step here? I don't understand what you're saying.
MR. LOCKHART: They, because they are INS, regulate immigration policy. And this is an issue where they will have to decide the ultimate fate of this young man. And the only thing that I can tell you that complicates it somewhat is that there may be a custody claim here, and that's just got to be worked through. They've got a process here that involves gathering the facts, which they have been doing. That process is not complete, and they're just going to have to work through it. And in a 24-hour news environment, I know that it may be frustrating that this takes time, but it does.
Q: Joe, in the Rose Garden, the President, when asked about liability of people who admit past mistakes, he seemed to indicate it probably wasn't much of a problem, didn't see that there had been a problem in the 22 states where there have been -- where there is some kind of legislation now. And then he said, it doesn't matter because we've got to stop people dying and we've got to admit past mistakes. But when these health care providers came out to the driveway, they said they need legislation to protect them. They're talking about that old term, tort reform, to give them some kind of protection so that an employee can come forward and say, I made a mistake, we have a wrong kind of procedure here, and have some kind of protection. How does the President feel about liability protection?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, there's a number of levels of answer to this. I think most doctors, when they take an oath to become a doctor, when they make a mistake they're responsible for coming forward, based on the obligations they've made in becoming a doctor. I think we've -- the IOM has indicated that we have 22 states that have a mandatory requirement that when you make a mistake you need to report that -- a mistake that causes a fatality. They have recommended that all states take on that requirement. I think the President believes that's the proper course of action, that all states should have the requirement.
But part of the process here is we're going to take 60 days to look at how we implement and move forward with these changes. I think the President's point here -- and another point, and probably more to what has gone into this discussion is there's -- I think if you just take the 22 states, they already have a requirement. This wouldn't change anything. And I think most Americans would believe that it wouldn't put any additional burden on health care providers to come forward with these mistakes.
But I think one of the areas that there's been a lot of discussion on is what, in the health care world they call the near-miss, where basically they make some sort of mistake, but they catch it and they're able to provide health care that does not cause a fatality. That's really an area where there's not incentive right now for people to come forward, but there's an obvious benefit if there is some pool of information about it, because people -- I think doctors make mistakes, and if there is a pattern of mistakes, it's easier to correct and I think improve the ultimate health care. So that we have to look at how we can create an incentive in those areas.
So I think there is a lot to discuss over the next 60 days before they report back to the committee, but I think ultimately, what has to come first is the health and well-being of patients. I think what you've heard from a number of people today is that's ultimately what they're concerned about.
Q: They were talking about near-misses. Obviously, if somebody does something that causes a problem for a patient, well, there are laws in effect and you've got to report those. But -- so the White House would not necessarily be against some sort of protection for people to encourage them to report near-misses?
MR. LOCKHART: I think we have to -- and one of the things we have to look forward in as this process goes forward is, is how we can find a way to create a system where there is an incentive to look at these near-misses. How that happens, I don't know. This is obviously, the experts are going to work on this. But we have a system now that does not provide -- does not require or provide any benefit to the health care provider to provide this information so that people can pool the information and make judgments ultimately on any potential changes that might be needed.
Q: Joe, the Social Security Task Force said that the system is actually going to be in worse trouble, because they're underestimating the life expectancy of baby boomers and subsequent generations. Does this change the President's strategy to revisit his Social Security?
MR. LOCKHART: No, not really. I think this is a board that provides advice on a yearly basis to the Social Security Trust Fund, and their report this year is somewhat mixed. It's actually -- if you're a normal person, it's all good news, but it has different impacts on the trust fund.
First, life expectancies are longer, which is good news for everyone, but actually has some marginal -- provides some marginal strain to the trust fund. Wage growth is higher, which actually lessens the burden, and they note that interest rates are lower, which obviously has good impact on people's daily lives, but does provide some strain to the trust fund.
I think as far as when the trust fund will have problems with solvency isn't likely to change by a significant time frame. I don't think they, with this advice, they're looking at changing the years -- that it will come upon us much faster.
But I think it does underscore the fact that Social Security needs an infusion of capital on the solvency front. We need to look at the Social Security system. And the President will return to this early next year, and challenge Congress to work with him to find a long-term solution.
Q: Well, he did that this year and he didn't get anywhere --
Q: He did it last year, too.
MR. LOCKHART: He did.
Q: And he did it last year, so what is he going to do differently this year --
MR. LOCKHART: Well, he is going to continue to work with Congress and hope that something -- maybe it's the nearness of them facing their constituents again, and the prospect of having to discuss Social Security and why we haven't been able to find a solution. I can't predict what will happen. But the President is committed to continue working on this.
Q: Are you saying that -- the election will make it more likely to happen?
MR. LOCKHART: You know, it's a strange city.
Q: You're saying that he's not going to propose a plan to reform Social Security, and then try to generate support for it. He's going to wait and hear what Congress might support?
MR. LOCKHART: No, no. The President has put forward a number of ideas. We've sent up lockbox legislation --
Q: But reform of the system, not the financing, but actual reform, like dealing with questions such as the level of benefits, the retirement age -- all the things that people in the administration once talked about as things that needed to be addressed.
MR. LOCKHART: Well, there are issues that need to be addressed. I think the first issue is solvency. We've put forward legislation on solvency, and we'll continue to work in what we think is the best way to get the Social Security system reformed.
Q: Has he cleared his desk of all the bills on his desk now? I mean, is he ready to face the future --
MR. LOCKHART: Well, no, he's probably got another 50 or so that have to be signed. There are some that haven't come down here yet, or are on the way down. I guess -- is Kennedy-Jeffords down? Everything's now down. We'll do some signings in a public way; most of them will be signed privately, but that process won't be complete for another week.
Q: How do you plan to deal with the next two weeks, start of the new year? What will he be working on?
MR. LOCKHART: We will have the press conference tomorrow, we've got a number of new initiatives that the President will talk about next week and the following week. I think the week -- he'll have some time off around Christmas and the week between Christmas and New Year's. We have a few events that deal with commemorating the millennium.
Q: Does this report, the Social Security report provide, since it does indicate that people will be living longer provide any more incentive for the President to consider raising the retirement age further?
MR. LOCKHART: I think again, it doesn't -- it does not provide a radical change in the solvency issues, but I think it does underscore, as I said, the need to look at solvency and look at some reforms. So I don't think it has a qualitative impact on the President's views on Social Security, except to underscore the fact that we need to deal with it soon.
Q: Has the President ruled out moving the retirement age further?
MR. LOCKHART: I think he's spoken to that and spoken to the problems that -- doing that, both on Social Security and on Medicare.
Q: And what did he say on the retirement age?
MR. LOCKHART: That there are a number of problems with moving the retirement age, but we need to sit down and work through a number of the reforms.
Q: Does he plan to stay here during the whole Christmas season? Is he going to travel to --
MR. LOCKHART: I don't have a travel schedule much beyond next week. I don't know of any trips that are in the works.
Q: -- contacts by the President with the European Union on the upcoming Helsinki Conference on the candidate status for Turkey?
MR. LOCKHART: No contacts that I know of in particular. I do know that the President spoke quite strongly and forcefully on that issue while he was in Turkey, and his views, I think, are well-known.
Q: Joe, speaking of travel, can you finally lay to rest some of the reports in the Northern Irish newspapers about the President possibly going there by the end of the year? Has he decided against doing that now?
MR. LOCKHART: At this point, I have no way to -- I don't believe the President will travel between now and the end of the year to Northern Ireland or any other foreign destination.
Q: How about -- is he likely to take vacation time after the first of the year?
MR. LOCKHART: That is something I have been trying to find out about, and I don't know the answer to. (Laughter.) For personal reasons.
Q: Is there any likelihood that the Kennedy-Jeffords bill would be signed this week rather than next?
MR. LOCKHART: I don't think so.
Q: Is he going to help his wife move?
MR. LOCKHART: Sure.
Q: Put the furniture in the right place, and all?
MR. LOCKHART: Yes, he'll pack up, unpack, whatever. Whatever is appropriate and necessary, or necessary and appropriate.
Did I do it? Yes. Twenty minutes. Twenty minutes.
Q: It seemed like an hour. (Laughter.)

Bill Clinton,"December 08, 1999",The President's News Conference,"The President. Good afternoon. Before I take your questions, I have a statement to make. We are at a pivotal moment in the Middle East peace process, one that can shape the face of the region for generations to come. As I have said on numerous occasions, history will not forgive a failure to seize this opportunity to achieve a comprehensive peace.
We've made good progress on the Palestinian track, and I'm determined to help Prime Minister Barak and Chairman Arafat move forward in accordance with their very ambitious timetable.
We've also been working intensely, for months, for a resumption of negotiations between Israel and Syria. Today I am pleased to announce that Prime Minister Barak and President Asad have agreed that the Israel-Syrian peace negotiations will be resumed from the point where they left off. The talks will be launched here in Washington next week with Prime Minister Barak and Foreign Minister Shara.
After an initial round for 1 or 2 days, they will return to the region, and intensive negotiations will resume at a site to be determined soon thereafter. These negotiations will be high level, comprehensive, and conducted with the aim of reaching an agreement as soon as possible.
Israelis and Syrians still need to make courageous decisions in order to reach a just and lasting peace. But today's step is a significant breakthrough, for it will allow them to deal with each other face to face, and that is the only way to get there.
I want to thank Prime Minister Barak and President Asad for their willingness to take this important step. And I want to thank Secretary Albright who has worked very hard on this and, as you know, has been in the region and meeting with the leaders as we have come to this conclusion.
Before us is a task as clear as it is challenging. As I told Prime Minister Barak and President Asad in phone conversations with them earlier today, they now bear a heavy responsibility of bringing peace to the Israeli and Syrian people.
On the Palestinian track, Prime Minister Barak and Chairman Arafat are committed to a rapid timetable: a framework agreement by mid-February, a permanent status agreement by mid-September. I'm convinced it is possible to achieve that goal, to put an end to generations of conflict, to realize the aspirations of both the Israeli and the Palestinian people. And I will do everything I can to help them in that historic endeavor.
It is my hope that with the resumption of Israeli-Syrian talks, negotiations between Israel and Lebanon also will soon begin.
There can be no illusion here. On all tracks, the road ahead will be arduous; the task of negotiating agreements will be difficult. Success is not inevitable. Israelis, Palestinians, Syrians, and Lebanese will have to confront fateful questions. They face hard choices. They will have to stand firmly against all those who seek to derail the peace, and sadly, there are still too many of them.
But let there also be no misunderstanding. We have a truly historic opportunity now. With a comprehensive peace, Israel will live in a safe, secure, and recognized border for the first time in its history. The Palestinian people will be able to forge their own destiny on their own land. Syrians and Lebanese will fulfill their aspirations and enjoy the full fruits of peace. And throughout the region, people will be able to build more peaceful and, clearly, more prosperous lives.
As I have said, and I say one more time, I will spare neither time nor effort in pursuit of that goal. Today the parties have given us clear indication that they, too, are willing to take that path. Peace has long been within our sight. Today it is within our grasp, and we must seize it.
Thank you very much. Terry [Terence Hunt, Associated Press].
Elian Gonzalez
Q. Mr. President, on another matter involving a foreign government, as a father, do you sympathize with the demand of Elian Gonzalez for the return of his 6-year-old son to Cuba, now that the boy's mother and stepfather were drowned in a boating accident on the way to Florida?
The President. Well, I think, of course, all fathers would be sympathetic. The question is and I think the most important thing is what would be best for the child? And there is a legal process for determining that.
I personally don't think that any of us should have any concern other than that, that the law be followed. I don't think that politics or threats should have anything to do with it, and if I have my way, it won't. We should let the people who are responsible for this, who have a legal responsibility, try to do the right thing by the child.
These decisions are often difficult, even in domestic situations, but I hope that is what would be done, and it should be done without regard to politics.
Helen [Helen Thomas, United Press International].
Middle East Peace Process
Q. Mr. President, did both sides make a lot of concessions to get to this breakthrough point? And also, are you aware that Amnesty International says that Israel is continuing the demolition of Palestinian homes in east Jerusalem and on the West Bank and also the expansion of the settlements? Are all these part of a package?
The President. Well, Prime Minister Barak made a very important statement about settlements yesterday, which I think was quite welcome. And it's a good first step. As you know, we believe that nothing should be done which makes it more difficult to make peace or which prejudges the final outcome. But I do think that the statement yesterday is a step in the right direction.
As to your question about Syria, I think it's very important at this point that we maximize the chances for success, which means it would not be useful for me to get into the details. But the negotiations are resuming on the basis of all previous negotiations between the United States and Syria—I mean, between Syria and Israel, and with the United States.
I think it is clear that both parties have sufficient confidence that their needs can be met through negotiations, or they would not have reached this agreement today.
Steve [Steve Holland, Reuters].
Russia and the Situation in Chechnya
Q. On Chechnya, you used sanctions to punish Yugoslavia and Indonesia for repression; why aren't sanctions being considered against Russia?
The President. Well, there are two categories of aid here in question—or, at least—let's talk about the aid. A sanctions regime has to be imposed by the United Nations, and Russia has a veto there. But I'm not sure that would be in our interest or in the interest of the ultimate resolution of the crisis.
Let me just say, with regard to the aid, because I've been asked about that, I think it's important to point out to the American people that two-thirds of the aid that we spend in Russia is involved in denuclearization and safeguarding nuclear materials. And I think it is plain that we have an interest in continuing that.
The other third goes to fund democracy, the things that we Americans believe would lead to better decisions. It goes to an independent media; it goes to student exchanges; it goes to NGO's, helping people set up small businesses. I don't think our interests would be furthered by terminating that. And as of now, there is no pending IMF transfer because of the general opinion by the IMF that not all the economic conditions have been met. So that's a bridge we'll have to cross when we get there.
Yes.
Middle East Peace Process
Q. Mr. President, when Israel and Syria do sit down, they obviously are going to have to confront the issue of the Golan Heights almost immediately. How are they going to resolve that? What will the U.S. role be? Will you see the administration—Secretary Albright, yourself possibly—being a mediator? And finally, why isn't President Asad sitting down with Prime Minister Barak at this point?
The President. I think they're sitting down because they want to make peace, and they have now concluded that they can do it on terms and that will meet both their interests. You've asked good questions, but any answer I give would make it unlikely that they would be successfully resolved. Frankly, we all took a blood oath that we wouldn't talk beyond our points today, and I'm going to keep my word.
Q. Sir, maybe you misunderstood. I was asking why President Asad is not personally involved in the talks at this point.
The President. Oh, he is very personally involved. I think that—I believe that he felt it was better—and maybe you should ask the Syrians this—but let me just say, he is very personally involved in this. I think he thinks it better, for whatever reason, he's made the decision that Foreign Minister Shara, who, thankfully, has recovered from his recent stroke and is perfectly able to come here, to do so. And I'm quite comfortable that this is as close to a personto-person talk that they could have without doing it.
Yes, go ahead.
Elian Gonzalez/Situation in Chechnya
Q. Mr. President, can I follow up about Cuba and Chechnya? With regard to Cuba, you said that politics ought to stay out of this decision regarding the boy. Are you saying, sir, that you can envision a circumstance where, in your mind, it would be appropriate to return this young boy to Communist Cuba?
Second question, regarding Chechnya: Given the fact that two-thirds of the aid goes to denuclearization, a third to democracy effects, do you envision no circumstances, sir, under which the United States would cut off that aid? And how does that square with your statement that Russia will pay a heavy price for its war against Chechnya?
The President. Okay, the first question first. I do not know enough about the facts, so you can draw no inferences to what I might or might not do because it's not a decision for me to make. There is a law here. There are people charged with making the decisions. I think they ought to do their best within the parameters of the law; do what seems to be best for the child.
That is all I have to say, and you shouldn't read anything into it. I don't know enough about the case, and I don't think that any of us should interfere with what is going to be a difficult enough decision as it is.
Now on Russia, I have stated what my present view is, and that is all I have done. I think Russia is already paying a heavy price. I think they'll pay a heavy price in two ways. First of all, I don't think the strategy will work. As I said, I have no sympathy for the Chechen rebels; I have no sympathy for the invasion of Dagestan; and I have no sympathy for terrorist acts in Moscow; and none of us should have. But the people of Chechnya should not be punished for what the rebels did. They don't represent the established government of Chechnya. They don't represent a majority of the people there. And the strategy, it seems to me, is more likely to hurt ordinary citizens than the legitimate targets of the wrath of the Russian Government.
So I think that—first of all, I think the policy will not work, and therefore, it will be very costly, just like it was before when it didn't work. Secondly, the continuation of it and that amassing of hundreds of thousands of refugees, which will have to be cared for by the international community—we've already set aside, I think, at least $10 million to try to make our contributions for it—will further alienate the global community from Russia. And that's a bad thing, because they need support not just from the IMF and the World Bank, they need investors. They need people to have confidence in what they're doing.
They're about to have elections. And so there will be a heavy price there. And I don't think there's any question about that.
I think it's already—yes, go ahead.
Elian Gonzalez
Q. Sir, regarding the Cuban boy, you say you don't know enough about the facts. A lot of people in South Africa think the facts are pretty simple. They say that even though the boy's father's in Cuba, this boy would be better off growing up in the United States than in Cuba under Castro. What would you say to those people?
The President. Well, I think the decisionmakers will take into account all the relevant facts. But I don't think I should make the decision. First of all, I can't make the decision under the law. And I don't think I should tell them how to make the decision because I don't know enough about the facts. I believe they will do their best to make the right decision.
Q. What about growing up in Cuba as opposed to growing up in the United States?
The President. Well, of course, I'd rather grow up in the United States. But there may be other considerations there, and one was asked in the previous question about it. So we'll just have to evaluate it.
You know, there are times in the United States when judges have to make decisions. The legal standard governing domestic cases is the best interest of the child. There's a slightly different characterization, I think, of what will determine the international decision here. This is, you know, an unusual case for us. But even here, sometimes it's very hard to say. You know, will children be better off with their parents in America? Almost always, but not always.
So you just can't—I don't think—I can't serve any useful purpose by commenting on it, because I don't know enough about the facts of the family life or even the governing law on this. I just know that I think we ought to let the people make the decision, urge them to do their best to do what's best for the child, and try to take as much political steam out of it as possible so that the little child can be considered.
Yes.
Federal Action Against Gun Manufacturers
Q. Sir, on another legal matter, your threat of a class-action against gun manufacturers, is this an attempt, sir, through either coercion or, ultimately, the judicial branch, to get accomplished what you couldn't get accomplished through legislation? And with the difficulties that you've had recently getting some of your initiatives passed in Congress, as you head into this last year of your Presidency, is this the hint of a new tactic to get those initiatives passed, when you can't get them through Congress?
The President. Let's talk about the gun suit first, and then I'll respond to the general question. The litigation, which is being initiated by public housing authorities, has a good grounding in fact. There are 10,000 gun crimes every year in the largest public housing authorities. Now, they spend a billion dollars on security. And I think it's important that the American people know they're not asking for money from the gun manufacturers; they are seeking a remedy to try to help solve the problem.
They want, first of all, more care from the manufacturers and the dealers with whom they deal. Senator Schumer released a study, you may remember, that said that one percent of the gun dealers sell 50 percent of the guns involved in gun crimes. Now, if that study is accurate—and he believes it is—that is a stunning fact. And there ought to be something done about that. And if there is a way that the court could craft a resolution of that, that would be a good thing, I think. The second thing we want to do is to stop irresponsible marketing practices. You all remember that one company advertised an assault weapon by saying that it was hard to get fingerprints from. You know, you don't have to be all broke out with brilliance to figure out what the message is there. And the third thing they want is some safety design changes.
Now, let me hasten to say that we have a lot of gun manufacturers in this country who have been, I think, immensely responsible. You'll remember the majority of the gun manufacturers signed on to our proposal for child trigger locks. I still would like legislation to cover them all. But this should not be viewed— if you look at the nature of the release, they're not trying to bankrupt any companies; they're trying to make their living spaces safer. And I think it's a legitimate thing.
Now to your general question, I think if you go back over the whole reach of our tenure here, I have always tried to use the executive authority in areas where I thought it was important. We're doing it on medical privacy. We're doing it on—yesterday we had the press conference on prevention of medical errors. We're doing it with the paid family leave initiative we offered to the States. We did it when we set aside the roadless areas in the forests. So I think this is an appropriate thing to do.
But I would also remind you at the end of this legislative session from the Congress, we got 100,000 teachers, 50,000 police, 60,000 housing vouchers to help people move from welfare to work. We passed the Kennedy-Jeffords bill to allow people with disabilities to move into the workplace and keep their medical care from the Government. We passed the Financial Modernization Act, which will dramatically, I think, improve financial services, grow the economy. And we've protected the Community Reinvestment Act. We doubled funds for after-school programs. We provided, for the very first time ever, funds to help school districts turn around failing schools or shut them down.
So I'm continuing to work with Congress, and I will do so vigorously. But I think this was an appropriate thing to do on the merits.
Yes.
Seattle Round
Q. Mr. President, some of your critics have suggested that the reason that you pressed the issues of the environment and labor at the WTO meeting in Seattle is to benefit the Presidential candidacy of Vice President Gore, knowing that there might be a backlash from the developing nations. How do you respond to that?
The President. That's wrong. And I would like to make two comments, one on the WTO ministerial meeting and, secondly, on that general issue.
The Uruguay round was launched in 1986. The trade ministers started trying to launch it in 1982. It took them 4 years to get it off the ground. The fundamental reason a new round was not launched here had, in my judgment, very little to do with my philosophy of trade, which I'll talk about in a moment. There were—the big blocks here were the Europeans and the Japanese, on the one hand. The United States and the developing nations, we all had positions that couldn't be reconciled. The Europeans were not prepared at this time to change their common agricultural policy, which accounts for 85 percent of the export subsidies in the world. The Japanese had their own agricultural and other issues to deal with.
The United States was not prepared to change its policy on dumping, because—and I think the recent Asian financial crisis justifies that, I might add. Even though we did finally move under our dumping laws, and we had to move, to try to keep our steel industry, which took down 60 percent of its employment and modernized during the eighties and the early nineties, we still bought 10 times as much steel during that crisis as the Europeans did. The recent WTO agreement we made with China protects us from surges and unfair dumping. We have the largest trade deficit in the world. Now, we get a lot of good out of it: We get low inflation; we get goods from all over the world. But there has to be some sense of fairness and balance here.
And the developing nations, for their part, felt that they had not yet gotten enough benefits from the last trade round and the entry into the WTO. They think that we and everybody else—the Europeans, the Japanese, everybody— they think we ought to have more open markets for agricultural products, which doesn't affect America so much, and for textiles, which does affect us. That's the big issue being negotiated still with the Caribbean Basin and the Africa trade initiative.
So it's very important that you understand that there were real differences that we thought we could bridge, unrelated to labor and the environment, which we couldn't and which I think would have been clearer but for the backdrop of the demonstrations in Seattle over these other issues.
Now, to your second question. When I ran for President in 1992 and the big issue being debated was NAFTA, I said that I wanted to be for NAFTA, I would fight hard for it, but I felt strongly there ought to be provisions on labor and the environment in the agreement, and those provisions were included. I have always had what I guess you would call a Third Way position on trade. I think the position of Americans, including some in my party, that trade is bad for America and bad for the world is just dead wrong.
I think that the world is more prosperous, and I know America is more prosperous because of the continuing integration of the world's economy and the mutual interdependence of people and people being able to produce what they produce best in a competitive environment, including costs. And I think we benefit, not just from our exports but from the imports. That's what I believe. I believe we will have both a more prosperous and a more peaceful world if we have more of the right kind of globalization.
I read—one of the many, many articles that's been written in the last several days in the aftermath of Seattle pointed out that many of the world's most troubled places, the Balkans, the Caucasus, Africa, to some extent the Middle East, suffer because they have too little economic interconnection with the rest of the world.
I believe, even though I'm proud of the role that we've played and especially proud of the role George Mitchell played in the Irish peace settlement, I think it is unlikely that we would have done that if, also, Ireland didn't have the fastest growing economy in Europe and Northern Ireland weren't growing and people didn't imagine that they could have a totally different life if they just let go of what they've been fighting over.
So the people who don't believe that trade is good, I just think they're wrong. Now having said that, I think that as the world grows more interdependent, it is unrealistic to think that there will be an international economic policy with rules unrelated to an emerging international consensus on the environment and an international consensus on labor. That does not mean that I would cut off our markets to India and Pakistan, for example, if they didn't raise their wages to American levels. I know that's what the sort of stated fear was. I never said that, I don't believe that.
But I think that—let me give you an analogy. Several years ago, the Europeans did this, and I applaud them: They were actually the impetus for protecting intellectual property more than the United States was. And people debated that for years. Why, intellectual property has no place in trade bills. Who cares if people are pirating books and selling them for 60 cents apiece when they cost $20 somewhere else? And now, we just take it as a given. And it's a good thing for the United States.
You think about all the software we're exporting, all the CD's we're exporting, all the things. Intellectual property is a big deal to us now. It was just as alien a subject a few years ago to trade talks as questions of labor and the environment are today.
So I think I've got a good position here. It has nothing to do with this campaign. It's a position I've had for years. And I believe the world will slowly come to it. We do have to be sensitive to the developing countries. We cannot say that, you know, you're out of here because you can't have the same labor environment we do. But we also have to—all we ask for was to start a dialog within the WTO on trade issues. On the environment, all we ask is is that the decisionmaking process not degrade the environment when countries have environmental policies and interests, and just blithely override them because there's an immediate, short-term economic benefit.
I think that's right. And I believe that 10 years from now, somebody will be sitting here, and we'll all take it for granted that we've come a long way in integrating trade and the environment—I mean, trade and labor. That's what I think, and that's what I believe.
Man of the Century
Q. Mr. President, I'm afraid this is in the pop-quiz category of questions, but I'll try to make it easy for you. Every year, this time of year, we pick a Man of the Year. Maybe one day it will be Person of the Year. I'd like to know what your pick of the Man of the Century would be; and note that I'm not asking you for the millennium. [Laughter]
The President. Well, if it were for the millennium, it might be someone different. Well, this century produced a lot of great men and women. But as an American, I would have to choose Franklin Roosevelt, because in this century our greatest peril was in the Depression and World War II and because he led us not only through those things and laid the building blocks for a better society with things like Social Security and unemployment insurance, which was, interestingly enough, first recommended by his cousin Theodore Roosevelt when he was President, but he also looked to the future, endorsing the United Nations and a lot of the other international institutions which were subsequently created under President Truman.
Finally, I think Roosevelt was an example to Americans of the importance of not giving up and of the dignity inherent in every person. And when Franklin Roosevelt was first elected, Oliver Wendell Holmes was still in the Supreme Court; he was 92 years old. And President Roosevelt was taken to see Oliver Wendell Holmes who was still reading Plato in his nineties and all that. Holmes was a pretty acerbic fellow when he said, after meeting Roosevelt, that he thought he might not have had a first-class mind, but he certainly had a first-class temperament.
And he did. He understood that reality is more than the facts before you; it's also how you feel about them, how you react to them, what your attitude is. That was the advice that— ""only thing we have to fear was fear itself"" was much more than just a slogan to him. He had lived it before he asked the American people to live it.
So for all those reasons, if I had to pick one person, I would pick him. Yes, sir.
Colombia and Venezuela
Q. Mr. President, I'd like to ask you two questions on two very important South American countries that are vital to U.S. foreign policy, Colombia and Venezuela.
First of all, on Colombia, sir. President Pastrana has been extraditing people, and they're still waiting for the help that he is expecting from the United States. Will you fight, will you go to the mat for this, starting in the year 2000, for President Pastrana? That's the first question.
The second question——
The President. You're all asking two questions. That's pretty impressive. [Laughter]
Q. We're just following the others.
You met President-elect Chavez when he first came to Washington, and then you met him as President in New York. He will be—Venezuela will be holding a very unique plebiscite a week from today, which has polarized the country. Some people that back President Chavez thinks it's great; others think it will cause damage to democracy. I'd like your opinion on both subjects, sir.
The President. My opinion on the second question is that I'm not a citizen of Venezuela, and I think that they ought to make their own decisions. But I'm glad that they're getting to vote on it.
My opinion on the first question is—I should point out remember, now, Colombia is already the third biggest recipient of American aid. But I do think we should do more. And President Pastrana has, number one, extradited drug criminals to this country, which is important; number two, is facing a terribly difficult situation where he has both a longstanding civil insurgency in Colombia and all the problems of the drug cartels and the possible interrelation of the two. It's a terrible situation.
Colombia is a very large country. They've been our ally for a long time. They had a long period of steady economic growth. They have suffered terribly in the last couple of years. And I think we should do more.
I had a talk with Speaker Hastert about it, who is also, by the way, very interested in this, when we were together in Chicago recently. And I hope that early next year, we will have a proposal to provide further assistance to Colombia that will be substantial, effective, and have broad bipartisan support. That is my goal.

Vice President Al Gore
Q. Vice President Gore has made a point of saying that his candidacy for President now will take precedence over his duties and activities as Vice President. I wonder, how has his role diminished in your administration, and how much has he missed? And does a diminished role by a Vice President in your administration hamper what you're trying to do in any way?
The President. Well, obviously, he's not around as much. We don't have lunch every week, and I miss that terribly. But he was there all day today. He had the meeting with President Kuchma. He knows that the future of Ukraine is very important to our interests and to what we're trying to accomplish in that part of the world. And he came to our meeting this morning, and then, after our meeting was over, he ran a whole series of meetings for several hours after that. So in his critical functions, he's still performing them.
And I would say, first of all, I strongly support what he's doing. I think he has the right to run. I'm glad he's running, and you know I think he'd be a great President. But he—even having said that, whenever there's an important decision in an area that he's been very active in, I always call him; we still talk about it. And his role is probably still larger than that of any previous Vice President, even though he's out campaigning. But it's just less than it used to be, because he's not here all the time.
But I have no criticism of it. I think he's doing what he ought to be doing, and I think it's in the best interests of the country for him to do it.

Accomplishments and Disappointments of 1999
Q. You're ending a tumultuous year that began with impeachment and closed with tear gas in Seattle. Could you tell us what you're proudest of this year, and what events or accomplishments of yours that you're the least proud of?
The President. Well, I'm very happy—what I'm proudest of is that it turned out to be a very productive year. If you look at—I'll just mention them again. I did before, but we wound up—after a year in which almost nothing was accomplished in the Congress, we wound up with a recommitment to the 100,000 teachers, to the 50,000 police. We passed the financial modernization bill. We passed an historic 60,000 housing vouchers to new people from welfare to work. We passed the bill to give disabled people the right to take health care into the workplace. We doubled after-school funding. We passed this fund that I've been pushing hard for, for a long time, to help the States turn around or shut down failing schools. We had quite a lot of accomplishments.
On the foreign front, we had the China-WTO agreement; progress with the Middle East peace; the Northern Ireland peace agreement; Kosovo, which I am very, very proud of. I still believe our country did the right thing there. And we've got talks starting on Cyprus now. We've got a Caspian pipeline agreement, which I believe 30 years from now you'll all look back on that as one of the most important things that happened this year. We had the Conventional Forces in Europe agreement with Russia, which will result in the removal of their forces from Georgia and Muldova. We had the debt relief for the poorest countries in the world, something I'm immensely proud of and deeply committed to. We made a big dent in our U.N. arrears issue. And we have worked with North Korea to end their missile program. So I'm very proud of what happened this year.
What I'm most disappointed in is what still got left on the table. I'm terribly disappointed that we still haven't passed a Patients' Bill of Rights, that we still haven't raised the minimum wage, that we still haven't passed hate crimes legislation, that we still didn't pass that commonsense gun legislation, which was crying out for action after what happened at Columbine—and we had another school incident this week. I am disappointed that we didn't pass the school construction bill. I'm hoping we will pass the new markets initiative next year. If we don't do something now to bring economic opportunity to the areas of this country which have been left behind, we will never forgive ourselves. And I'm profoundly disappointed that we still haven't done anything to take the life of Social Security out beyond the baby boom generation and extend the life of Medicare and add a prescription drug benefit.
So my only disappointments are what we didn't get done. But I'm gratified by what was accomplished.
Q. Do you blame yourself for that, that you didn't put forward a plan on Social Security, to make it more substantive? Is there something you're—[inaudible].
The President. No, I gave them—first of all, I asked them—there's no point in putting forward—look, I tried it the other way with health care. I put forward a plan. And everybody said, you put forward—I remember Senator Dole saying, ""You put forward your plan, then I'll put forward my plan. We'll get together. We'll agree, and we'll pass a plan."" And so, you know, I've had experience with that. That didn't work out too well.
So I had all these meetings on Social Security. You remember, I worked very hard on it, and I asked if we could get together and work out something. I still haven't given up on that, by the way. And I know the conventional wisdom is that these things are less likely to be done in election years, but in some ways they may be more likely.
And I did give them a plan which, if they had embraced it—which would simply require them not only to save the Social Security surplus but to take the interest savings from paying down the debt, with the Social Security surplus, and if you just put that back into Social Security, you could take Social Security out beyond the life of the baby boom generation. And I offered to do more with them.
But in order to pass something like that, we've got to have a bipartisan process. And I will do whatever it takes to get that done. But I worked as hard as I could this year to keep working in a very open and collegial spirit with not only the Democrats—without whom I wouldn't have passed any of those things I just mentioned, and all of you know that; they hung in there at the end; we got those things done— but also with the Republicans, with whom I began to have, I think, some real progress there along toward the end of the legislative session. And I hope we will continue it.
Yes, go ahead.
Russia and the Situation in Chechnya
Q. Mr. President, on Chechnya, it seems as though the Russians don't feel they will pay a heavy price, and perhaps they don't care. I'm wondering if between now and Saturday's deadline you plan to try to directly contact President Yeltsin to once again convey your feelings on this matter.
The President. Well, I haven't decided what else I can do. I do think—first of all, they may believe that because of their position in the United Nations and because no one wants them to fail and have more problems than they've got, that they can do this. But most of life's greatest wounds for individuals and for countries are self-inflicted. They're not inflicted by other people.
And I will say again, the greatest problems that the Russians will have over Chechnya are— one is I don't think the strategy will work. I have never said they weren't right to want to do something with the Chechen rebels. But I don't think the strategy will work, and therefore, it will be expensive, costly, and politically damaging, internally, to them.
Secondly, it will affect the attitude of the international community over a period of time in ways that are somewhat predictable and in some ways unpredictable, and that is a very heavy price to pay, because it works better when everybody's pulling for Russia. It's a great country, and they have all these resources and talented, educated people, and they need to—and yet, they've got a declining life expectancy as well as all these economic problems. And I think it's a bad thing for this to be the number one issue both inside the country and in our relationships with them. So I do think it's going to be a very costly thing.
Yes.
Panama Canal/China and Taiwan
Q. Mr. President, with China building a second short-range missile base, allowing them to take Taiwan with little or no warning, are you concerned about America's ability to defend that island, especially with a Chinese company taking over the Panama Canal's ports at the end of this month?
The President. Well, let's talk about the Panama Canal, and then I'll come back to Taiwan. And to be fair, I think I may have misstated this earlier. It's important for the American people to understand that the canal itself will be operated and controlled entirely by the Government of Panama, through the Panama Canal Authority. That is the locks, ingress and egress, access, openness, the canal is completely and totally within the control of the Panamanians.
Now, the Hong Kong company which got the concession to operate the ports will be responsible for loading and unloading ships. They also do this in three or four ports in Great Britain. It's one of the biggest companies in the world that does this. The managing director is British. Most of the employees will be Panamanian. So I feel comfortable that our commercial and security interests can be protected under this arrangement. That's the first question.
Now, the second question is China is modernizing its military in a lot of ways. But our policy on China is crystal clear: We believe there is one China. We think it has to be resolved through cross-strait dialog, and we oppose and would view with grave concern any kind of violent action. And that hasn't changed.
There has been a lot of buildup of tension on both sides that I think is unnecessary and counterproductive. If you look at the amount of Taiwanese investment in China, for example—that goes back to my Irish example—if you look at the Taiwanese investment in China, it's obvious that eventually they're going to get this worked out because they're too interconnected by ties of family and, increasingly, by ties of the economy, and the politics of neither place should lead either side into doing something rash. And I hope that this will not happen. But our policy is clear, and you know what I've done in the past. And I think that's all I should say about it right now.
Yes.
Hillary Clinton's Senate Campaign
Q. There is some confusion in people's minds about the First Lady's plans for the coming year. She has referred to the new house in New York as ""my house"" and indicated she plans to make that her primary residence. I'm wondering if you could tell us how much time you think the two of you will be apart in the coming year and how you feel about this arrangement?
The President. Well, first of all, I am happy for her, for the decision that she made. She was encouraged to run by many people, and she decided she wanted to do it. And if she's going to do it, she's got to spend a long time in New York. So she'll be there a lot. She'll be here when she can. I'll go up there when I can, and we'll be together as much as we can. We always make it a habit to talk at least once, if not more, every day. It's not the best arrangement in the world, but it's something that we can live with for a year. I love the house. We picked it out, and we like it, and I'm looking forward to living there when I leave here.
But I've got a job to do, and she now has a campaign to run, and so we'll have to be apart more than I wish we were. But it's not a big problem. She'll be here quite a lot, and I'll go up there when I can, and we'll manage it, and I think it will come out just fine. I'm very happy for her.
Wendell [Wendell Goler, Fox News Channel].
Responsibility for Impeachment
Q. Mr. President, just a couple of minutes ago you said that most of life's greatest wounds are self-inflicted. If I can paraphrase a recent request by Ken Starr, sir, I wonder if now you can tell us how much of the pain you went through last year was self-inflicted and how much due to excesses by other people, political, and Mr. Starr's excesses himself, sir?
The President. The mistake I made was selfinflicted, and the misconduct of others was not. Yes.
Golden Parachutes
Q. Mr. President, in the case of—on the subject of corporate golden and platinum parachutes, particularly in the case of mergers and change of controlled packages, tens of millions, and more in most cases, are awarded to corporate officers. Directors just rubberstamp most of these sales to the detriment of other stockholders.
The President. What's the question?
Q. I'd like to know, what can and will the administration do to put a ceiling on this acrimonious alimony?
The President. Well, first of all, unless it's an abuse of the stockholders—and if it is, then we have Federal agencies which have jurisdiction over it—there's nothing we can do. We have made some changes in the tax laws—we did back in '93—that I thought were appropriate. But I don't think beyond that there's anything else we can do.
April [April Ryan, American Urban Radio Networks], and then John [John M. Broder, New York Times]. Go ahead. No. April. I'll call on all of you, but April first.
Q. Okay.
The President. April first. [Laughter] That's the way I feel up here sometimes. [Laughter]
Q. It should be that way, though. [Laughter]
Racial, Ethnic, and Religious Differences
Mr. President, America is ending the century with resurfacing scars of racism. And where does the issue of race, in terms of your agenda for 2000, stand? And are you still prepared to release your book on race by the end of your term? And what do you think about the comments that there's internal fighting over this book in the White House?
The President. There really isn't much. I have a draft now, and I'm working on it. And I do plan to release it. And it will stay at the center of my concerns not only now but after I leave the White House.
I think that after the cold war and with the sort of end of the ideological battles, you've seen, I think that the biggest problem the world faces today is the conflict people have over their racial and ethnic and their related religious differences. And I plan to be heavily involved in it at home and around the world for the rest of my life.
Q. When do you think the book will come out, though?
The President. I don't know. I've got a day job, you know, and I'm not going to—I've got a library full of books on race, and almost all of them are quite good. But I don't want to put it out unless I think it could make a difference, even if it just says what other people have said, somehow it can make a difference. And I'm trying to make sure how it ought to be done. I don't want to just put it out because I said I would put it out; I want to make sure when I do it, it at least achieves the objectives I'm trying to achieve.
John.
Health Care Coverage
Q. Mr. President, the number of Americans who are not covered by health insurance has increased since you took office by about 7 million. Do you agree with Vice President Gore that Senator Bradley's plan for covering most of those people is irresponsible and unaffordable, even though we're enjoying the healthiest economy in decades?
The President. First of all, I'm not going to get in the middle of the Gore-Bradley campaign—I know you want me to, but I'm not going to do that for you—[laughter]—because I want you to write about Syria and Israel tomorrow.
Let me say, first of all, Hillary and I said when the health care plan went down that the number of people uninsured would go up. And you would all draw the same conclusion. You would have drawn the same conclusion back then if you spent as many years and as much time studying it as we have.
So what happened is exactly what we've predicted would happen. Ironically, all those people who attacked me and said I was trying to socialize medicine, which was a ridiculous charge, trying to have the Government take over health care, which is a ridiculous charge, they got their way in that debate, and the consequence is now, we now have a higher percentage of Americans whose health care is funded by the Government than we did in 1993. But we also have a higher percentage of people without insurance.
Now, I'm not going to get in the middle of that, but I'll tell you what questions you ought to ask. First of all, anybody who makes any proposal, you have to make certain choices. If you want to cover people who don't have coverage and you accept the premise that they all can't afford it, you have to decide: Are you going to make them buy insurance; are you going to make their employers to pay in? If not, are you going to have the Government do it, or are you going to have a big tax subsidy?
All of those choices have problems with them. You know what the employer mandate problem was; we couldn't pass it, because a lot of people said it's too burdensome, even though we exempted small businesses and tried to give them subsidies. If you give all taxpayers subsidies, the problem is you have to give subsidies to people who already have insurance, and it may operate as an incentive for employers to drop people even faster.
So there is no perfect plan. Let's start with that. There is no plan without difficulty. If it were easy, somebody would have done it already.
Second question is how much are you going— if you're going to have the taxpayers involved, either in a tax incentive or expenditure program, how much does it cost, and what do you give up? And I think this is the way this thing ought to debate. People ought to actually try to figure out what the consequences of these plans are and evaluate them and decide.
You talked about the prosperity of the country. That's true. We are prosperous. But do we want to—how much do we want to spend on that as compared with eliminating child poverty or continuing to improve education? Are we willing to get into the Social Security surplus? If we're not, are we willing to raise taxes for it? In other words, I think whatever the choice is, I think it's important that we be as honest as possible about what it costs, everybody be as honest as possible that there is no perfect plan. And then you be as honest as possible about what else you're giving up if you do it. It's a very complicated issue.
I did my best on it. I am gratified that we finally passed the Child Health Insurance Program. And we might get those numbers down again. We've now—I think we're at about 2 million. I think we've gone from 1 million to 2 million just in the last several months in the number of people covered under CHIP. And if we can get up to 5 million with CHIP and extra Medicare kids—and the States are really gearing up, now; they're really trying now—then maybe we can drive that number back down some.
And what the Vice President is trying to do is to target discrete populations, on the theory that you can cover more people for relatively less money. And that's his position, and he believes he can pass that.
Let me just say one other thing. It makes me proud to be a Democrat. I am proud that, number one, that my party is debating this. And as near as I can see, there is no debate going on in the other party. And if they pass the size tax cut plan, they're talking about, they not only won't have any money to help more people get health care; they'll either have to get into the Social Security surplus, or they won't have any more money for education or the environment or anything else. That's the first thing I want to say.
The second thing I want to say is I'm grateful that my country is doing so well that these kinds of issues can be debated in this way and be seriously debated, but I'm not going to get into handicapping the campaign. I can tell you what questions I think you should ask, how you should analyze it. But there is no perfect solution here. And I'm glad that the two candidates in the Democratic Party are debating it.
Yes, go ahead. I promised these people.
Space Program
Q. Mr. President, in the decade that's just closing, the American people have seen around $1.5 billion of their tax dollars lost in space, most recently either up in smoke in the Martian atmosphere or trashed on Mars itself. Does NASA need better quality control or better management? And sir, how do you answer Americans who say that that money could be much better spent on more urgent needs here on this planet?
The President. Well, let me try and answer all those questions. First of all, I think Dan Goldin has done a great job at NASA. He's adopted a lot of economy measures and gone for small and more discreet missions, including more unmanned missions, that I think make a lot of sense.
Secondly, we all use the slogan, ""Well, this isn't rocket science."" Well, this is rocket science. We're trying to take a spaceship the size of a boulder and throw it 450 miles into a very uncongenial atmosphere and hit a target, and it isn't easy. I regret that both of those things didn't succeed as much as we all—the first Mars mission we got quite a lot out of—because I think it's important. I think it's important not only for the American tradition of exploration, but it's important if we want to know what's— we have to keep doing this if we ever hope to know what's beyond our galaxy. We now know there are billions of them out there, and we know there are all these big black holes in the universe. We know all these things, and I think it's important that we find out.
The third point I'd like to make is that we actually do get a lot of benefits here on Earth from space travel. We get benefits in engineering advances, in material science, in environmental protection, and in medical science. We've made quite a lot of interesting healthrelated discoveries. I remember going down to the Space Center in Houston and talking to people who were from the vast medical complexes in Houston about all the interesting joint work they were doing.
So I think the American people get things out of it right now. I think we have gotten a lot out of it in the past, and I think we'll get more out of it in the future. So I have always been a big proponent of the space program. They need to analyze what went wrong and figure out how to fix it.
But just think of all the problems we've had along the way with the space program. This is too bad, but this is nothing compared to the tragedy when those astronauts burned to death when their spaceship was still on the ground. I'll never forget that as long as I live. But they didn't quit, and America didn't quit, and I'm glad. And I don't think we should quit now.
Go ahead.
WTO-China Agreement
Q. Mr. President, one of the things left on your plate for next year is pushing the historic trade agreement with China on Capitol Hill. China's labor standards are clearly not what you and the world community would wish for. And the question is will it be difficult for you to sell that to members of your own party in Congress? And more broadly, what do you think are the prospects for Congress approving the WTO accord with China?
The President. Well, in our caucus some are for it; some are against it; and some have questions. We have a good deal of support for it and a good deal of opposition to it, and then some have questions. But I'm going to make an all-out effort to pass it. And I'll come back to your labor question in a minute.
I think it is plainly in America's interest. We gave up nothing, in terms of market access, to get this. It's very important that you understand that. What we gave in this was our assent to China's joining the WTO. What we got in return is much more market access on everything from farmers to people in the telecommunications industry. This is a huge economic benefit to the people of the United States. Plus, we have a big and growing trade deficit with China. We've got specific protections on dumping and antisurge protections. So it is in the economic interest of the United States.
Secondly, it is in the strategic interest of the United States. One of the great questions of the next several decades, as China's economy grows to match the size of its population, is whether China and the United States will have a constructive relationship or be at odds. I believe that, just as we worked together in the United Nations, even though we sometimes disagree, we will work together in the WTO. I think having China in a rule-based system for the international economy is profoundly important. And I think it would be a terrible mistake not to do it.
Now, do I agree with all their labor standards? No. But we shouldn't impose conditions on membership on China that we don't impose on any other country to get into the WTO. What we should do, in any judgment, is to go back to the American position. We ought to begin a dialog on these labor initiatives within the WTO—that's all we ask for—and then we ought to get everybody to ratify the International Convention on Child Labor and observe it and deal with the other most egregious forms of labor abuses in the world. That is the right way to proceed here.
Last question.
National Sovereignty and Internationalism
Q. Mr. President, in future years, what do you see taking great precedence, sir, national sovereignty or international institutions? And how does the world prevent such slaughters as you've had recently in the Balkans, in Africa, or East Timor, without violating national sovereignty or interfering in international affairs?
The President. Well, first of all, at least from the International Declaration of Human Rights, 50 years ago, the world community recognized that sovereignty was not the only value in human society. The Russians, even though they've criticized our intervention in Kosovo— although now I might say the Russian soldiers are doing a very good job there, working with all the other allies—recently acknowledged in their signing off of the new charter of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, that the internal affairs of a country can become the legitimate concern of others, whether it's in East Timor—now, wait a minute.
So what I think will happen is national sovereignty is going to be very, very important for a very, very long time. But countries are becoming more interdependent, and they will still have to make decisions about the kinds of internal systems they will have for how their people live together and work together; they will still be able to make decisions about when they will or won't cooperate worldwide in many areas. But if you want the benefits of interdependence, you have to assume the responsibilities of it.
And we've all recognized that from the beginning of the United Nations, nobody, no country in the United Nations, has given up its sovereignty, even though some people still allege that's true. But the more interdependent the world grows, the more likely we are, in my judgment, to have more broadly shared prosperity, fewer wars, and a better life for everyone. That does not require us to give up our national sovereignty, but it does require us to act in our real national interests.
Last question.
Minorities on the White House Staff
Q. Thank you. I have another question on the issue of race, and it's on your record of appointing minorities to top-level jobs in your administration. You've talked throughout your career about the importance of diversity and inclusion, and setting aside your Cabinet and Federal bench appointees, the top seven West Wing jobs in your administration have all been held by whites. Twenty-six people have had the jobs.
The President. I disagree with that. What are they?
Q. Well, Chief of Staff, National Security, Domestic Policy, Economic Adviser, White House Counsel, Press Secretary, Senior Adviser, Counselor—all those jobs have been held by—not a single person of color has held any of those jobs. And I wonder if you could tell us why?
The President. Well, first of all, you might be interested to know there were a couple of people of color that I tried to get to do those jobs but preferred other jobs in the administration. And they had jobs they liked better. And I have—you didn't point out that a lot of those jobs have been held by women, who also had never held those jobs before I came along. And I think that—all I can tell you is I have never not tried to recruit minorities for any job that was open in the White House. And I have never followed a quota system. I have had more blacks who have served in my Cabinet, more Hispanics who served in my Cabinet, more people from Asia have been appointed to my administration than any previous administration by far. It's not even close. So there was never a decision made. I now have a Hispanic woman who is my Deputy Chief of Staff.
So I never thought about those seven jobs to the exclusion of others. I've tried to make sure that the senior jobs—my political director is an African-American woman. Alexis Herman, before she became Secretary of Labor, was head of public liaison. I was unaware that those were the seven most important jobs in my Cabinet and in the White House in the way that you said them.
Thank you very much.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1060
Bill Clinton,"December 09, 1999",Remarks on the Digital Divide and an Exchange With Reporters,"The President. Good morning. I just thought we ought to come out here in the brisk morning sunshine and wake up together. [Laughter] I want to thank the representatives here from all parts of the communications industry, from the foundation world, from various civil rights and other civic groups for being here, and coming in and giving me a chance to make this statement, because I had intended to go to Secretary Daley's conference today on bridging the digital divide, and because I'm going to Worcester, I couldn't do that. So they came in this morning, and we had a visit. I want to thank them for being here and for their commitment and for all those who aren't here but who are at the conference.
This conference is about closing the digital divide. And we have worked hard on that for the last several years in very specific contexts. Under the Vice President's leadership, we have worked to make sure that eventually a digital divide will not deprive business of the technology-savvy workers they need and will not hurt our educational systems today.
We started with the first NetDay in California, back in 1994, when only 3 percent of our classrooms were wired and only 14 percent of our schools were. And we've been working ever since. Now we know that, through the public-private partnerships that have been established all over America, through the Telecommunications Act and the E-rate, which the FCC set to make sure our poorest schools could afford to be connected, we're now up over 50 percent of the schools, from 3 percent, and over 80 percent of the classrooms, from 14 percent, since 1994. And I think that's pretty good.
I'm very pleased by that, and we're on our way to meeting our goal sometime next year of having all of our schools wired and, soon after that, all of our classrooms wired. I want to thank the Vice President and all the people in various industries who have supported us and helped us in this regard.
But as Secretary Daley's most recent ""Falling Through the Net"" report shows, there is still a lot more to do. We must connect all of our citizens to the Internet not just in schools and libraries but in homes, small businesses, and community centers. And we must help all Americans gain the skills they need to make the most of the connection. So this morning, as they go back to their meeting, I want to announce a series of new plans and partnerships that will expand on both these efforts to use the combined forces of public, private, and nonprofit sectors, finally to slam shut the digital divide.
First, I have decided to lead a prominent delegation, including top CEO's, on a new markets tour this spring to focus specifically on the digital divide out in America. As we've done on our previous tours, we will visit communities that have not fully participated in our Nation's economic growth. And yet, in the communities we'll also see how partnerships between the public and private sectors can unleash the power of the Internet to link children and adults to a lifetime of learning, to provide access to distant medical care, to empower parents, to assist job seekers, to enhance safety, and foster economic development.
Second, I am signing an executive memorandum to ensure that closing the digital divide will be a vital goal not just for Secretary Daley and for us here in the White House but throughout the Federal Government. For example, I'm directing Secretary Daley to work with the private sector to develop a national strategy for connecting all Americans to the Internet and directing Secretaries Daley, Riley, Herman, Cuomo, and Shalala to expand our growing network of community technology centers.
I just ask you all to think about this one thing. What do you believe the economic impact would be if Internet access and usage were as dense in America as telephone access and usage? I think it's clear that we need to keep working until we achieve this goal.
Third, with the help of many other groups, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights is launching an initiative to empower the entire civil rights community through an expanding civilrights.org website, through leadership forums and even modern-day freedom riders who will bring high-tech training to the doorsteps of nonprofit organizations.
As the Congress of National Black Churches has said, the digital divide is a key civil rights issue of the 21st century. That's why our civil rights organizations must be ready, wired, and able to lead the change.
Fourth, the Benton Foundation is bringing together companies from across the computing, telecommunications, software, and Internet industries, as well as the Urban League and several other large private foundations, to create the Digital Divide Network, an enormous clearinghouse of information for information on public and private efforts to bring technology to underserved communities. For the first time, we'll have one-stop shop for tracking our progress in every community and for learning exactly what's worked and what hasn't.
Now, these are the steps we'll take immediately. I want to thank all the leaders who are here today who are making these initiatives possible and all of those who are going to announce specific things that they and their companies and organizations are doing at the conference. I thank them for the other major commitments they will make, because there is no single, big silver bullet here, but we know we have to have a national commitment to closing the digital divide.
I also want to send out an invitation to all of your counterparts around the country who are not able to be with us today but who should join with us in this great national endeavor. Together we have the power to determine exactly what we want the Internet to become. And what we want it to do is to be an instrument of empowerment, education, enlightenment, and economic advance and community building all across America, regardless of the race, the income, the geography of our citizens. And thanks to these people, we're going to be closer to achieving that goal.
Thank you very much.
Russia and the Situation in Chechnya
Q. Mr. President, there seems to be a divide with President Yeltsin this morning. He has given you something of a long-distance tongue lashing, saying that you've forgotten that Russia is a great power and has a nuclear arsenal. And he accuses you of taking an anti-Russian position.
The President. Well, I'll say again what I said yesterday. I don't think what they're doing will help them to achieve their goal. Their goal, their legitimate goal, is to defeat the Chechen rebels and to stop their terrorism within Russia, to stop their invasion of neighboring provinces like Dagestan. And I don't think displacing hundreds of thousands of civilians will achieve that goal. I don't know what else to say.
I haven't forgotten that. You know, I didn't think he'd forgotten that America was a great power when he disagreed with what I did in Kosovo. I mean, we can't get too serious about all the—let's not talk about what the leaders are saying and all these words of criticism. Let's focus on what the country is doing. Is it right or wrong? Will it work or not? What are the consequences?
I think—I don't agree with what's going on there. And I think I have an obligation to say so.
Thank you. I've got to go.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-digital-divide-and-exchange-with-reporters
Bill Clinton,"December 16, 1999",Press Briefing by Joe Lockhart,"The Briefing Room
12:08 P.M. EST
MR. LOCKHART: Good afternoon, and welcome to the White House briefing for Thursday. I have no opening statement and nothing to announce, so we'll go right to your questions.
Q: So what's happening at Blair House?
MR. LOCKHART: I haven't gotten any readout so far. My understanding was Secretary Albright was there, was going to meet with the parties, and then after those meetings bring the parties together. And my understanding is they all arrived around 11:00 a.m. So the discussions are ongoing.
Q: So still no substance, right?
MR. LOCKHART: Still no substance. Say that three times fast. Okay, I guess I won't.
Q: So do you expect them to come over here at some point this afternoon?
MR. LOCKHART: I certainly think it's in the realm of possibility that after their meetings over there, they'll come over and see the President.
Q: When you say no substance, you mean you have no substance to report, not that there's no substance taking place?
MR. LOCKHART: Correct. I expect that there is substance being discussed.
Q: Do you know if they sat down alone together yet?
MR. LOCKHART: I have no detailed reports out of the discussions this morning.
Q: Will there be a closing ceremony, a communique, in the afternoon after the meeting with the President?
MR. LOCKHART: When and if they come over here and have a discussion with the President, if they have something to announce, I expect we'll announce it in a public way.
Q: Any atmospherics to share?
MR. LOCKHART: Not from this morning.
Q: Do you know why the talks started over an hour late, and whether the Israelis were meeting with U.S. officials this morning, and the same with the Syrians?
MR. LOCKHART: My understanding is that they began --
Q: They left their hotel at about 11:40 a.m.
MR. LOCKHART: Okay. Well, then they arrived 40 minutes late. That's news to me.
Q: We're they meeting with U.S. officials this morning?
MR. LOCKHART: I don't have any information on what their activities were this morning.
Q: Do you have any comments on Israel's proxy army in South Lebanon shelling a school, wounding 15 schoolchildren, and the risks attendant thereto, as in Hezbollah is apt to retaliate and shell --
MR. LOCKHART: Well, I think all I'll say on that subject is that we've been in touch with all parties involved, and stressed the importance of exercising restraint.
Q: Joe, in spite of the sort of news blackout, Israeli sources are saying that they're supposed to meet again next month and that the two sides have agreed that they would like to conclude the talks within a year.
MR. LOCKHART: All I'll say is that we made an agreement that the substance of this wouldn't be discussed. I'm not going to discuss it and you all will have to make your judgments on the basis of whether those who are saying understand the dynamic and are in the loop.
Q: They are.
MR. LOCKHART: Thanks for your assessment there. I'll take it under advisement.
Q: Would you like to know which minister?
MR. LOCKHART: No. I'm fully aware of who is saying what.
Q: Is it true that the President suggested that they come back and meet here next Wednesday?
MR. LOCKHART: As I said this morning, what is being said in the room and potential further discussions go to the heart of the substance of these discussions, as we've indicated to you. We agreed beforehand not to discuss that in public. I, for one, will honor the agreement that I made.
Q: Joe, will you just elaborate on what the thinking was in not talking about what was going on in the room.
MR. LOCKHART: Sure. I think one of the things that created the kind of atmosphere at Wye River that got us to the point where we reached an agreement was the discussions were done in the room and not in the paper. And we believe that's a good model, and that's why we're moving forward in the way we are.
Q: Joe, a Hezbollah leader said in an interview that he didn't expect either the Lebanese or the Syrians to put pressure on Hezbollah to stop its attacks. How do you react to that?
MR. LOCKHART: He is welcome to his opinion.
Q: The Lebanese have formed a delegation for a negotiation headed by the Interior Minister. Can you shed any light on the Lebanese access --
MR. LOCKHART: No, not at this point, no.
Q: Has the President been directly involved in any way today by being on the phone with either delegation?
MR. LOCKHART: Not this morning. He got a report -- he had a meeting with his team last night before he went off to a holiday reception, which lasted about 30 or 40 minutes. He had a discussion this morning with Mr. Berger, his National Security Advisor, and I expect he's got some other items on his schedule that have taken up his attention this morning. But I expect when he comes back from the luncheon he will turn his attention back to this process.
Q: When you said that the White House had been in touch with all parties involved on South Lebanon, and expressed the need for an exercise of restraint -- all parties, does that include the Hezbollah?
MR. LOCKHART: That includes -- I would go to the State Department for a further explanation of that as they're doing the discussions.
Q: The EU-U.S. summit agenda?
MR. LOCKHART: Yes. Let me talk to you about that because I was woefully under-prepared this morning and now I am very prepared. I expect -- as you know, these are -- they meet twice a year with the EU to discuss the new transatlantic agenda. The last one we had was in Bonn at the back end of the G-8 meeting in Cologne. Expect to review progress in transatlantic cooperation including Southeast Europe, Kosovo, Bosnia, the Stability Pact that we talked about over in Europe, some discussion on Russia-Chechnya, counterterrorism, nonproliferation, trade, justice and law enforcement.
Q: On trade, what specific topics are you going to tackle?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, there are a number of issues that we have been discussing with them, including hush-kits, bananas, beef, general WTO questions about launching a new round, some of the things we talked about while we were in Seattle. So I don't anticipate breakthroughs on any particular subject, but these summits generally turn at some point to trade.
Q: How long is the meeting for? Where is it? And does it conclude, as it sometimes has, with a news conference?
MR. LOCKHART: It does not, which is probably the most important piece of information you wanted out of that litany. (Laughter.) When does it start?
MR. LEAVY: I'm not sure what time it starts, but --
MR. LOCKHART: I think it's three or four hours total.
MR. LEAVY: Actually, this is shorter this year. It's like an hour and a half --
MR. LOCKHART: Okay. It was scheduled for Wednesday, but because of the peace talks we put it to Friday. I expect it to go a couple hours. And we will provide expert people to read out.
Q: In the Oval?
MR. LOCKHART: I think it's in the Oval or in the Cabinet Room. It's over here.
Q: Joe, what can you tell us about the bin Laden associates who were arrested in Pakistan, and your level of comfort that Musharraf, despite a change in government, is still looking out for American interests?
MR. LOCKHART: I can't tell you too much about the suspects that were arrested, but let me make a couple points on the level of comfort. We believe that the Pakistani government should move quickly towards restoring civilian rule, democratic civilian rule. While this is obviously a good development, that these suspects have been brought into custody, there's certainly more we think they can do. Given their influence and proximity to the Taliban, we have talked to them on several occasions about putting pressure on the Taliban, as far as their harboring of bin Laden and his associates.
Q: Also on the Taliban, have you heard back after Michael Sheehan's meeting with Mujaheed in Queens? Other than the one-word statement carried in the AP, that venerable news organization, in which it was called propaganda? (Laughter.)
MR. LOCKHART: I haven't heard anything specific. I think that meeting was designed particularly to deliver what I view as a one-way message, and I think it was delivered.
Q: -- suspects -- going to be tried over there, they are going to be back here in the U.S. to be tried?
MR. LOCKHART: I don't have any information on where they'll be tried.
Q: Joe, why do you think there will be no breakthroughs on any of those trade disagreements? It's just sort of the general statement of positions?
MR. LOCKHART: No, I think there's a process for several of them working through the WTO, and I don't expect, in the context of a U.S.-EU summit that we'll resolve these problems. I mean, as you know, bananas is an issue that's been litigated within the WTO, now, for some time, as well as hush kits, beef. These are things that don't generally reach a conclusion in this context.
Q: And also, do you expect the President to pressure the Europeans to finish up their deal with China? Because there are people on the Hill indicating that the China legislation, the permanent normal trade relations legislation, won't go forward until that's settled.
MR. LOCKHART: Well, it's quite possible that that subject will come up. But I don't think the President will be putting any pressure on the EU. I think they very much want to conclude this agreement in their own interests, as we did, now, a month or so ago. So I don't know that this will be a point where we're applying overt pressure.
Q: Can you give us any update on this morning's meeting on Vieques? And can you tell us what should come next?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, this morning's meeting with -- John Podesta, the Chief of Staff here, met with his counterpart from the government of Puerto Rico -- is part of an overall effort to encourage dialogue in an effort to reach a resolution to this. I have nothing specific to report out of the meeting, except that that effort continues.
Q: Joe, going back to Taliban, U.N. sanctions have been there on Afghanistan, and do you think they are still working, because Afghanistan is not giving up the --
MR. LOCKHART: Well, the U.N. sanctions, I think, were put in place, I think, five weeks ago, at the most. So I think anyone who looks at the course of history, and how sanctions work, will understand that these will take time, as a tool that applies pressure to a country or an organization. You can't look at it four weeks out and make a judgment on whether it's worked or not.
Q: -- Taliban to give up bin Laden?
MR. LOCKHART: I think the meeting that I referenced earlier made clear what our view is.
Q: Joe, has the White House received a copy of Virginia Governor Gilmore's report on domestic terrorism?
MR. LOCKHART: Actually, I looked into this. This is part of a long-term effort that the Secretary of Defense initiated. It's a three-year process. This is the first reporting that's been done. It's gone to the Secretary of Defense. But there's still an enormous amount of work to do to complete this work. So I think I'm going to hold off in commenting as they go through each of their steps, only to say that this is an important project initiated by the Secretary of Defense to look at the domestic threat of terrorism and the coordination that's done within our government, and it's important that they get on with their work.
Q: Can you tell us where we are now on the United Nations Security Council resolution in Iraq? Are you expecting one by the --
MR. LOCKHART: I know that the British requested a delay, which we expect to be brief, to try to generate support for the resolution. Our representatives, British representatives are working hard at that. But I can't tell you when we expect a vote, except that we expect it to be soon.
Q: Do you have any comment on legislation that -- be considered to close the entire naval base if we can't do live firing there?
MR. LOCKHART: I think the administration has worked very hard over the last several months to work constructively through dialogue between the Pentagon, the administration, the government and the people of Puerto Rico, to find a solution to this. I don't believe that this kind of legislation at this point falls under the category of constructive.
Q: Why not? Couldn't it help --
MR. LOCKHART: I think we've been working in good faith -- the Pentagon has, the people and the government of Puerto Rico -- to find a resolution, and we're going to continue to do that. And we don't particularly believe at this point that the threat of this kind of steps is constructive to the process.
Q: Are there any plans for the President to meet with the Governor of Puerto Rico anytime soon?
MR. LOCKHART: I don't have any information on that.
Q: Joe, India is one of the few countries in the world issuing a special standard on prisoners which will be unveiled by the Prime Minister of India, and to mark the 2000 years of -- but in this country, again, despite President Clinton call, the Southern Baptists are still issuing a warning against Hindus first, then Jews, and now this week they did against Muslims during the special holidays. So we're trying to repair and to bring peace in the 21st century, when they are trying to take us into this 20th century again --
MR. LOCKHART: Question? Comment? I think the President has made very clear his view from any quarter, no matter what quarter it comes from, his views on religious tolerance, and how one of the greatest challenges going into the next century is dealing with intolerance, dealing with ethnic and religious hatred, and coming to grips with the long-held resentments between religions. So I think he's been very clear in his opposition to whatever organization, including the Southern Baptist, that perpetuate ancient religious hatred.
Q: Joe, on the peace talks, is the administration pushing the Israelis to get this done before President Clinton leaves office?
MR. LOCKHART: I think the President believes were at an historic moment right now -- the fact that we've got, for the first time in 50 years, this high level meeting; we have the Syrian Foreign Minister and the Israeli Prime Minister here, demonstrating their commitment to getting a peace agreement done. That's what the President's focus is.
If there is pressure, there is pressure to take advantage of this opportunity now, and not squander it, and with nothing to do with the President's own time or tenure in office.
Q: Do you buy the premise of that question? Do the Israelis need to be pushed?
MR. LOCKHART: I think the fact that the Israelis are here and that the Syrians are here demonstrates the seriousness of their purpose and speaks more eloquently than anything that anyone else can say.
Q: Joe, do you plan to come out at all afterwards?
MR. LOCKHART: We're working through how we read out the day, depending on what happens. There will be something; I just can't tell you at this point what it will be or who it will be.
Q: Joe, what's the dynamic of the current political circumstances in the world that have led people in this administration to say that this is an opportunity that may not come again? Why might it not come again?
MR. LOCKHART: Because I think people who have watched the history of that part of that region in the world understand how fleeting these opportunities can be, how difficult the issues are. And when you have a moment where both sides have demonstrated a commitment to working together to find an agreement for peace, where there is the prospect of a comprehensive peace in the region, that's something that should be seized and not squandered based on the idea that we might reach the same dynamic sometime in the future.
Q: Joe, on Grozny, the Russians are denying reports that rebels killed several Russian military. Do you have any way to independently confirm if that's true?
MR. LOCKHART: We have no independent verification at this time on that. We've seen the reports. To the extent the reports are accurate, I think it does underscore the point the President has been making, that the path that the Russians are taking cannot ultimately lead to the goal that they've stated, and that the indiscriminate use of force has done more to enhance this cycle of violence, embolden the Chechen terrorists, and undermine the ultimate policy goal that they've articulated. We believe that there is no pure military solution here, that they have to engage in a dialogue. The OSCE Chairman in office is now in the region; we encourage the Russians to take these efforts seriously, and try to find a political solution.
Q: Is the President concerned that since the Russians got their noses so bloodied yesterday that they may launch an offensive to flatten the place? And has the President expressed any concerns in the last 24 hours along that proposed line to President Yeltsin?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, the President has not talked to President Yeltsin in the last 24 hours. But we continue to make the case that we think trying to pursue a military solution is counterproductive.
Q: What was the word on the release of the interview today? The interview that the President had? Are you putting out a transcript, or how are you handling it?
Q: Was there any news?
MR. LOCKHART: No news to my ear, beyond -- if you're looking at a day-by-day basis. And I think the transcript will probably be held until it's broadcast.
Q: Joe, the Secretary's going to see Mr. Ivanov, probably, in Berlin tomorrow. Will she carry any message on Chechnya? What you've said, of course, has been the U.S. policy, again and again and again. But it doesn't seem to be making headway, although they did call off the deadline for the civilians. Will the President send some message? Will he talk to Yeltsin at some point soon?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, I'm not going to speculate on when and if he will talk to Yeltsin. But I think the Secretary will bring a strong message that we have been articulating both publicly and privately about our views on the subject.
Q: Joe, we've seen many reports today in the press that the speech of Foreign Minister Shara displeased, to say the least, the American administration. Is there any truth to these reports?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, I think from the moment that they walked into the Oval Office, they entered serious discussions about how to move forward in the peace process. And I've, as you're now all painfully aware, committed to not talk about what they've talked about in the room, so --
Q: Did the speech displease -- what the press reports are saying that the speech of Foreign Minister Shara displeased --
MR. LOCKHART: Let me try this a different way, which is, you all have asked a number of questions on that subject, on issues that have to do with whether they shook hands or didn't shake hands. That's not what our focus here is. Our focus is, we brought them here because they demonstrated that they were serious about peace. They've done that. We want to figure out how we get from this point to discussions that will result in a peace deal. That's what we're focused on. We may not be talking about it in any detail, but that's what we're focused on. And these other issues are things that you all can talk about, but it's not something that we're going to spend a lot of time on.
Q: These reports are false? It did not displease the President?
MR. LOCKHART: I think my answer answered that question.
Q: Do you have any timeline when you might say something later on today --
MR. LOCKHART: When they're finished talking.
Q: -- if they go to midnight --
MR. LOCKHART: When they're finished talking. I think, as I said this morning, I think the basic schedule today will look a little bit like yesterday because of the time of year it is, there's a natural break around 4:30 p.m. or so, and we'll just have to see where we are.
Q: Some demonstrations are going on outside, people from the Golan Heights, and they don't --
MR. LOCKHART: Oh, in the back? I don't have a window. (Laughter.)
Q: They don't want to leave Golan Heights and they say this is too much pain for the people who have been there for many, many years. So what do you ask Syria, in order to bring the permanent peace in the Middle East?
MR. LOCKHART: Again, I'm not going to get into the discussions going on, only to say that if these were easy issues to resolve, they would have been resolved a long time ago. And if these were issues that didn't generate passion on all sides, they would have been resolved a long time ago.
But what's important here is that the two sides, in an unprecedented way, have demonstrated a commitment to resolving these issues, and that's what they're doing. That's what they're working at now.
Q: Joe, yesterday the President said that the military involvements by the United States in the region and by other countries is costlier than the costliest peace. Does that indicate that --
MR. LOCKHART: Costliest -- the cost of it being involved -- he has said this in many different contexts, but I think his view is the costliest peacekeeping force is a lot less expensive than the cheapest war.
Q: Could you explain -- is this, in a sense, to prepare for the possible U.S. involvement in the costs of establishing peace in this region?
MR. LOCKHART: No, I think the President was just reflecting on his view, whether it be involved in the current commitments we have in the Middle East or whether in the Balkans or other places in the world that oftentimes, an investment in peace in the long run is something that saves a lot of taxpayer dollars.
Q: If I could just ask another question. The Israeli Knesset appears to be wavering on the peace process as far as -- Barak's coalition appears to be a little bit soft. Do you have any comment on that?
MR. LOCKHART: That is a matter of Israeli internal politics. I checked the vote, and I think that they voted to support the process and I think that's what the Prime Minister was looking for.
Q: Could I just come back?
Q: Please.
Q: One more. (Laughter.)
Q: Would you answer John Roberts question? (Laughter.)
MR. LOCKHART: He did call AP an esteemed organization.
Q: Venerable, actually.
MR. LOCKHART: Venerable. What does venerable mean?
Q: Old.
MR. LOCKHART: Old?
Q: Old and respected.
MR. LOCKHART: One out of two.
Q: Ooooh.
MR. LOCKHART: Respected. You're not old, Terry. You're not old. (Laughter.)
Q: He is, too, old. (Laughter.)
Q: Can John ask his question?
Q: Thank you. Then we can get out of here.
MR. LOCKHART: Were you going to say thank you -- Terry? (Laughter.)
Q: This is just a little further than the question asked before. I'm wondering if you can just give us a little bit more of an analysis of the current dynamic. When we talked about this window of opportunity. Is it that Barak has a limited amount of time before his coalition starts to fracture -- now is a good time for a peace deal -- is there the question of secession in Syria?
MR. LOCKHART: I don't know that it would be useful for me to speculate on the motives -- no, or to analyze the motives of the two sides. What's important is they're here. They're here, doing the hard work of peace, they're having discussions that we hope will put them on a path towards reaching peace, and I just don't see any value in my analyzing their motives beyond acknowledging that they're here and that this is an historic moment.
Q: Terry?
Q: John, do you have anything else?
Q: No, nothing. (Laughter.)
MR. LOCKHART: Thank you.
THE PRESS: Thank you.

Bill Clinton,"December 16, 1999",Press Briefing by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright,"The Briefing Room
4:25 P.M. EST
SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: Well, we have just concluded two days of very serious, and I think constructive discussions. And what came through to the President and to me was really a very clear determination by both of the sides to reach an agreement. And I think that -- I felt that they both left here with a sincere desire on the part of both of them to reach an agreement and they know, as we do, that there is a lot of work ahead of us, and that while there is a desire to work very hard, everybody knows that the road is not an easy one.
I think that no one has any illusions about the difficulties, but we are looking forward to an intensive round in, as the President said, starting January 3rd, in an area near Washington. And we want to make sure that it is a place where we are able to work in a very serious and intensive way, in an isolated place, where all the issues will be discussed.
I think you won't be surprised that I don't feel that it's appropriate to go into a lot of details, because the kind of diplomacy that we have conducted and will be conducted in order to succeed does not bear being talked about every few minutes.
What I found that was really quite, I think, inspiring, actually, for me, as I watched these two days is that both Prime Minister Barak and Foreign Minister al-Shara spoke very movingly about peace, the importance of peace to their people. They spoke about each other as partners and neighbors. And so that leads me to believe that, despite the difficulties which we all know will exist, it does make me believe that this can be done. Obviously, the United States, the President and I and the peace team led by Dennis Ross is going to be working very, very hard to do whatever we can.
Q: Do you see this taking on a Wye River feel, or a more Dayton Accord feel? Will you put them in a nice, plush resort, or will you put them into an air force base?
SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: What's happening now is that we have people from the State Department looking for appropriate sites that I think will be comfortable. The main kind of needs that we have is that it be close enough to Washington for the President to be able to come and go, as he did for Wye, and that the surroundings really be conducive to hard work, and some informal discussions, I think.
Q: Madam Secretary, you said no details, so, of course, I'll ask about details. Same cast of characters, right? Why do I hear confidence-building measures? Is there any suggestion that you're not going to go all the way, that there may be an interim agreement? Does that fellow over there get on an airplane anytime soon? What happens between now and January 3?
SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: Well --
Q: You only have 10 minutes, then I want to ask you about Chechnya.
SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: Are you coming with us, Barry?
Q: No, thanks.
SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: Let me say this. I think obviously this is going to be continuous work for everybody, that there's a great deal of work that has to be done to prepare for January 3rd. We've already said to each other, the three groups, or the two to each other with us, that we will stay in very close contact between now and January 3rd. They have to work with us in terms of setting up the whole procedures and how it's going to work.
I'm not going to give you details on what the final package is going to look like. But we are very intent on working with them. Obviously this is their process; we are the facilitators here. And we're going to be working with them on all the procedural --
Q: -- level when they come back? You've reached a new level.
SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: Yes. Yes.
Q: Do you expect to maintain that level?
SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: Absolutely, yes.
Q: Can you tell us about --
Q: What will be the role of that new round, and will it be open-ended?
SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: Well, first of all, the overall goal here is to reach peace and reach an agreement. And as you all know, there are various parts to that. I have stated those many times, that there really are four aspects to these talks: withdrawal, mutual security, the content of peace and the timetable. Those are subjects -- all those subjects are going to be worked on.
And in terms of the round itself, we're not putting limits. We're going to work to the extent that people are getting serious things done. But this is an ongoing activity. They have not met for four years, and they have certainly never met at this level. And it's very hard to predict exactly the length of time.
All I can tell you of what we came out from this is an incredible willingness for everybody to put their shoulder to the wheel and really work. And we will see.
Q: Other than their agreements and so forth, to get -- and we as a facilitator, what have we promised both sides? And why shouldn't we know?
SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: We have not promised anything. We have promised to give it our best effort.
Q: No money?
SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: No. There have been no promises or preconditions, and the President has said that he wants to be personally involved, and everybody is counting on that, and obviously, I will be, and Ambassador Ross and his team, but let me just say there has not been any agreement that has been made in the Middle East that hasn't, in some way, meant that we would be giving some kind of assistance.
But it is premature to discuss anything specific, and obviously, as we move into that, we will be consulting very closely. But I just want to -- there have been no promises made.
Q: Does the United States feel that the Syrians can control the Hezbollah?
SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: We generally believe that it is very important for there to be a deescalation and maximum restraint by all sides so that there is not any violence and the kinds of event that we saw I guess this morning for us in southern Lebanon is what we do not want to see. And we want to make sure, and we did talk today, about the necessity of everybody using maximum restraint to make sure that the enemies of peace are not able to disrupt anything.
Q: Did Syria promise to do that?
Q: Can you talk about the atmospherics today? Was there a handshake behind the scenes today or yesterday?
SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: Let me say this. There was not a handshake, but I think that the bottom line here -- and I can only give you my impression of this -- is that there was a real movement towards exchanging friendly discussion. We had a couple of times where it was just informal milling at Blair House, and they were talking to each other, talking about families and their aspirations and things that they had done in the past and looking for common threads.
During the talks, themselves, I think you need to understand the shape of the table. Basically, they were sitting across from each other and not very far apart, Barry; just a normal table -- (laughter) -- and I was sitting at the end. So it was not a three-way discussion. It was a face-to-face discussion, and I was kind of doing the formalities of opening it up and calling on people to speak.
So I think that there was a very good personal interaction that made these two days very important.
Q: -- two sides agree to talk again in January. Did they also agree on any substance? Any framework for the issues that they should tackle first? Any timetable?
SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: Well, they -- as I said, they have agreed all the issues are on the table. And that's as far as I'm going to go.
Q: A quick question on Chechnya please. You're on your way to Berlin. Can you move Ivanov this time? They've been very resistant to U.S. appeals.
SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: Well, let me say we are very concerned, and you know the Europeans are. We're going to have a G-8 meeting -- or they have already started, and I will join in tomorrow morning. And we will obviously be talking about Chechnya, and I think everybody is very concerned.
Knut Vollebaek, I'm not sure, actually, whether he got in today or not. You all know more than I, because I've been -- but it is on the subject.
Q: Madame Secretary, at what point does President Assad of Syria join these talks?
SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: Well, let me make this point clear. It's very evident that Foreign Minister Shara is here representing President Assad, and that he has President Assad's confidence. And President Clinton has, over a considerable amount of time in the past, been in touch with President Assad. I just saw President Assad.
And so I think that he is very much a part of these talks, whether he's currently, presently here or not. But I'm sure that at some stage he will. But there is no question in my mind about Foreign Minister Shara being here speaking on President Assad's behalf.
Q: Could you please tell us about the discussions, without particulars, the general atmospherics about confidence-building measures. Was there a package of confidence-building measures agreed to over there? Was it a large package? And were both sides receptive to the talks of confidence-building measures?
SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: There are discussions -- obviously this is part of what is an overall new atmosphere of the importance of confidence-building measures for a new Middle East. And what I found interesting, really, from both sides is the fact that they see what they're doing as historic and as opening up the possibility for an entirely different relationship, not only between Israel and Syria, but for the Middle East as a whole. And I think that rather than discussing anything specific, I just want to let you know that there is very much the sense that this is not just kind of a two dimensional operation, that this is something larger that involves a whole different relationship.
Q: -- one peace as opposed to -- peace?
SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: That's kind of -- I know those are code words, but I think that basically we are talking about something that is a qualitative difference in the relationship within the region. That's why this is so important. I think that's why, as we have looked at what happened these two days and the fact that we're going to be meeting again, that is what makes it so important.
And at the same time, if I can just make this clear, that is what makes it so difficult. I mean, we are talking about a sense of great movement forward and a sense of hope, but also a very kind of realistic view of the fact that we've got a lot to do. And so these two days were filled with hope and also frank realism about the amount of work that needed to be done.
Q: One more on Chechnya. Are you going to block a $500-million Ex-Im Bank loan for the Russia oil sector?
SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: I'm not going to discuss what I'm going to do on that. The subject is obviously one that people have been -- that Ex-Im has in front of it, and I have my people looking into it.
Q: --
SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: I don't know.
Q: Madam Secretary, the U.N. is finally supposed to vote tomorrow on this resolution. Are you confident that the new monitoring organization that will be set up by this resolution will be as strong as UNSCOM was and will be able to do the job that is necessary to eliminate --
SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: We will not be -- have been a part of negotiating this resolution or being supporting it if we did not believe that it was going to be able to do the job that we are concerned about, which is making sure that Saddam Hussein does not have the ability to reconstitute his weapons of mass destruction.
Q: Did the Syrians specifically reject or not respond to a request by the Israelis to rein in Hezbollah?
SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: I would like to say the following: The discussion came up about what went on in -- what goes on generally in terms of problems with terrorism. That was a general discussion, and we also spoke about the necessity of reining in those forces that create terrorist activity. I do not want to go beyond that.
Q: When is the Lebanese track going to be moving, how soon?
SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: I can't go into detail, obviously. For us, the Lebanese track is important. We see the necessity of having a comprehensive peace, and we also, let me say, spoke at some length about the importance of the Palestinian track and the importance of keeping all these tracks going. And Prime Minister Barak made quite clear, as I have a number of times, and as I did when I was in the region, that these tracks need to develop on their own dynamic and that one is not done at the expense of another. And the Lebanese track also has to move.
Q: Without getting into specifics, you talked about reining in terrorism. Did they agree to the general principle of trying to rein in terrorism during this interim period between now and January 3rd?
SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: I think that they both understood the importance of not having terrorist activities disrupt the peace process, and understanding fully that as one moves towards peace what we have found is that the enemies of peace are out there. But there was a discussion of the importance of doing everything possible not to let terrorism disrupt what's going on.
MR. LEAVY: Last question.
SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: I really have to go.
MR. LEAVY: Last question. Bob?
Q: Understanding that there are separate tracks, did you get any sense from Prime Minister Barak that Israel will or will not be able to meet the timetable with the Palestinian discussions that's been set for mid-February?
SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: Prime Minister Barak made quite clear his determination to follow through on what he's been doing on the Palestinian track. And when I met with Chairman Arafat, three days ago, four days ago, he also talked about the importance of moving forward on it. It is something that we are all determined to move forward on.
Thank you all very much.
Q: Have a nice trip.

Bill Clinton,"December 17, 1999",United States-European Union Summit Statement on Chechnya,"The United States and the European Union are deeply concerned about the situation in Chechnya. We recognize Russia's right to uphold its territorial integrity and to defend its citizens from terrorism and lawlessness, and we condemn terrorism in all its manifestations. But we believe that Russia's military tactics in Chechnya are undermining its objectives, creating a humanitarian crisis, endangering innocent civilians, and jeopardizing stability throughout the Caucasus region. A military solution to the conflict is not possible. We call for an immediate and lasting cease-fire throughout Chechnya and a political dialogue that can lead to a durable solution to the crisis.
The indiscriminate use of force against civilians is unacceptable. Providing for the safety of innocent civilians is a fundamental obligation of all states. We call on Russia to respect this principle unconditionally.
We stress that the respect for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of neighboring states is a fundamental principle of the international system. We are concerned by the impact of the Chechnya conflict on security throughout the Caucasus and stress the importance of avoiding steps that would further undermine regional security.
Displaced persons should be allowed full freedom of movement. Russian and regional authorities must provide for their well being. The United States and the EU strongly support the courageous efforts of international relief organizations, including the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), to provide humanitarian assistance to displaced people and others affected by the conflict. We ask Russia to work constructively with these organizations and ensure security for their personnel and access for their operations.
The OSCE Istanbul Summit Declaration noted that the OSCE could contribute to finding a political solution to the conflict. We are encouraged that OSCE Chairman-in-Office Vollebaek was able to visit the North Caucasus. We support his efforts to promote a political dialogue as well as the continuing role of the OSCE in finding a lasting solution to the conflict. We believe that an office of the OSCE Assistance Group should be opened in neighboring Ingushetiya to monitor the humanitarian situation. We call on Russia to respect all of the commitments it has made in the framework of the OSCE. In that regard, we acknowledge Prime Minister Putin's statements that he has held talks with representatives of Chechen President Maskhadov and urge continuation of meaningful discussions with responsible Chechen leaders.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/united-states-european-union-summit-statement-chechnya
Bill Clinton,"December 17, 1999",Press Briefing by Joe Lockhart,"The Briefing Room
1:20 P.M. EST
MR. LOCKHART: Let me get organized here. Okay, we're ready. Let me start on a serious note, and a somewhat sad note for those of here in the White House and the Press Office, I think for many of you here in the room, and I think the best way to do this is - Barry hasn't seen this yet, but the President has shared with me a note he has written to him, and I'm going to read it to you because I think it expresses what many of us feel.
Dear Barry, as you leave the White House I want to thank you for the dedicated service to the American people and to my presidency. You've done an exceptional job in a series of challenging roles. A Communications Director at the Office of Management and Budget, you did invaluable work writing and editing the budget, and helping us to return fiscal discipline to our federal government.
As Senior Advisor to the Chief of Staff, Leon Panetta, during a particularly challenging time, keeping the White House functioning smoothly and effectively during a government shutdown and a reelection campaign. And during the last three years as Deputy Press Secretary, you have served superbly on the front lines with Mike McCurry and Joe Lockhart, keeping the American people informed and involved in all that we are striving to accomplish.
To each of these varied and demanding responsibilities, you have brought keen judgment, toughness, wisdom and wit. You have been a good friend and a strong advocate, and I will miss you, as will your colleagues and many friends throughout the White House. As you begin a new chapter in your life you can be proud to know that you've made a genuine contribution to this administration and the well-being of our nation. I deeply appreciate the sacrifices that you and your family made, and I'm pleased that Chris, Daniel and Nora will be seeing more of you in the future.
Hillary joins in wishing you continued success and every happiness in the years to come. Signed, the President.
Now, in talking to the President this morning, he thought that this was a completely appropriate letter, but there were a couple of things that weren't necessarily appropriate to put in a letter of this kind that Barry would keep around for a while, and probably his family would treasure. So I made a few notes while talking to him this morning, and I think, in talking to the President about Barry, the first thing that he recalled was what a strong start he got off to. You know, it is rare for people in the White House to really distinguish themselves on the first day, especially in this job where you stand out here. He remembered that first day. And you all remember, Barry did a briefing that day, and did a fine job. And the President went out later in the day to respond to Barry's briefing. And you'll remember the question -- I think it was from a very friendly reporter, who - I've got the transcript here. It says, the question was, ""sir, does that mean you're going back on your promise? The White House said earlier, in fact this morning Mr. Toiv said that if it came here, you would sign it.""
The President: ""Well, he didn't talk to me before he said that."" (Laughter.) And it went on a little bit. The President expressed himself fully. And then there was a follow-up: ""Your spokesman, sir, was asked"" -- and the President cut in and said, ""Well, my spokesmen, they do a very good job here. But I made it clear to Mr. McCurry what my position is on this. And if an error was made by a spokesman, I'm sorry."" That is an auspicious debut - (laughter) - and the President remembered it quite well. In fact, I didn't need to get the transcript for that. (Laughter.)
There's other things, going back through some of the briefings that Barry has done. In fact, I don't know how I'm not in this book - or Mike isn't, for that matter - but Barry's in the ""Stupidest Quotes in Politics"" book, which Amy Weiss was kind enough to send over to me this morning. When asked why the briefing was starting so late, he said, ""I'm sorry. It's not easy getting up here and saying nothing. It takes a lot of preparation."" (Laughter.)
And finally, Barry, as you all know, is a straight shooter and really tells it to you, and there's no hiding from the tough facts; he gets right to it. There was one briefing, I think it might have been Mr. Angle, who questioned him during the height of impeachment when he said, ""Barry, you make it sound as if no one in the White House is even aware that all this is going on down at the courthouse."" And Barry looked at him with a straight face and said, ""That what is going on?"" (Laughter.)
So he has distinguished himself from this podium. But I think most of you who have traveled with us and have seen Barry on the road really know that he hit his stride that summer in Martha's Vineyard. It was hard to believe that for five days a nation could be gripped by the mystery of what the First Lady got the President for his birthday. I know you remember it; I remember USA Today printed excerpts of it daily, of Barry's trying to build suspense and keep the country from knowing so it reached a crescendo the day after he left. And the President - as you all know, he got a sculpture. And the President looks at that sculpture and he thinks it's Barry's. And he always thinks of you. So he asked me this morning to ----gap --
Okay, moving right along. (Laughter.) You all know that the President is probably the most photographed person in the world and there are a lot of famous photos. And as many of you know, Barry has a tendency to show up in some of them. But what you don't know is that he's really in a lot more photos than you know. And there are a number of ones that I want to show you that represent that.
The President does a lot of meetings with foreign heads of state. The President doesn't meet with a head of state without Barry Toiv, and I think this one, on a recent trip to Turkey, will demonstrate that. (Shows a photo.) (Laughter.) This is a very important photo, that Barry feels very strongly about Turkey's accession into the EU and he was there for that. (Laughter.)
Now , the President gives a very important speech every year where he lays out his domestic agenda and where we should be internationally, and he wouldn't do that speech without Barry. And I think as this photo indicates, he's always there for him. There's the Vice President, the former Speaker and Barry. (Laughter.) Now, you may not know this, but Barry is very close with the family. They never go anyplace without him.. Sometimes when they go off on vacation to far-flung places - like I think the trip to New Zealand, I think we have a picture of that that represents just t pecking order of things. There's the President, Chelsea, and Barry. (Laughter.)
Now, those of you who have toured t residence will know that the President has a very special place where there are just people who mean a lot to him and he puts their picture on the wall - it's a picture gallery. And I think you'd be interested in this one. (Laughter.) There is President Kennedy, President Reagan, Barry. (Laughter.)
Finally, my favorite, there is a very prized photo - I know you all get Christmas cards from the President, many people do. But not many people get t real one with the family picture, the one that you'd get from your friends or family. And it's a secret, but they let me bring it out this time just to show you what they send to their very close friends and family. Christmas with the Clintons - and Barry. (Laughter.)
Okay, enough pictures. I'm losing it now. Let me just finish with one thing. I think many of you know that working here in the press office is often tough work, dirty work, and sometimes there are difficult jobs to do. And most of us can do it in a stealth way and under the radar screen. But because certain people like Dick Morris felt that they had to write books, some were exposed. And Barry, from that point on, was known as the Assassin. And it's a fact of life, sometimes you get exposed. But Dick found out that Barry was leaving and he wrote this short letter to us, and we just wanted to share it with you.
Dear Mr. Toiv, it's with great interest and a sense of relief that I read that you will be leaving the White House. As a private citizen committed to the public welfare and common good, I've long lamented your craven campaign of leaks and lies in pursuit of your political agenda. Your hit-man mentality has no place in national affairs, and the American taxpayers suffer when the power-mad men like you hold positions of influence in our government.
As you know, in the past I've made no secret of my contempt for you and your tactics. I know my good friend Harold Ickes shares those sentiments entirely. (Laughter.) Your unrelenting assassination of his character was particularly disgusting. It is sad when mean-spirited men like you can drive earnest, well-meaning people like Harold and myself from public service. (Laughter.)
It is my fervent hope for this country that your position will be filled by someone who shares my own values of honesty, integrity, morality, decency and loyalty.
Signed, Dick Morris.
P.S.: once you get settled in your new position, how about lunch at the Jefferson? (Laughter.)
I'm going to get to questions eventually, but I want to actually say something serious, and I want to repeat something I said to the senior staff this morning, that we are sorry to see Barry go. I think those of you who have relied on him for the last seven years are probably sorrier than we are, because of all the service that he provided. But I think there were three things that stand out. One is, this is really my first job in government, and I hear a lot - and I think the American public hears a lot - about public service and government workers. But after spending nearly three years here, I think Barry typifies what's best in public service. He's spent 21 years working for the United States government in a selfless way, and in a way, I think, that has brought credit to both himself and to the country.
I think in this environment in Washington, it's very difficult to get through 21 years, much less 21 minutes, with your integrity attacked, with your honesty never questioned. And Barry's done that. And I think finally, in a town where it's not always easy to discern what someone's agenda is, Barry has brought a commitment here that he serves the President's agendas and the American people's agenda. And that's something that - when I walk out of here, if I can pass those tests in a way that comes anywhere close to Barry, I'll be very lucky and happy.
Thank you for your service, and we're going to do worse things to you later on today. (Applause.)
Okay, questions?
Q: --
MR. LOCKHART: As soon as I leave here, which I hope to be very soon, because I'm late, Tony Blinken will come down and give you a readout.
Q: What about the Democratic governors? What is that?
MR. LOCKHART: The Democratic governors are in town. They're looking to talk to people here in Washington about a strategy for picking up gubernatorial seats this year in the elections, overall campaign themes and strategies for Democrats this year. So the President will spend some time with them. I think it'll be a discussion of issues, a discussion of politics.
Q: Is the U.S. blocking the IMF loan to Russia?
MR. LOCKHART: No.
Q: Ex-Im.
MR. LOCKHART: Ex-Im. The White House has a policy where we don't dictate or block loans that the Export-Import Bank makes to Russian companies. We have provided some information about a particular company that we thought would be relevant in their decision making process. But it's up to the Export-Import Bank to make a determination on that loan.
Q: But you wanted to influence the decision.
MR. LOCKHART: We certainly believe it's proper to provide information that we think is relevant to decisions that the Export-Import Bank makes. We've done that. But it is not our decision to make.
Q: Would you like to see the loan delayed?
MR. LOCKHART: Pardon?
Q: Would you like to see the loan delayed?
MR. LOCKHART: Listen, I think it would be improper to get into the details. They are an agency that is able to make independent decisions. They will do that in this case. We do believe they have information that's relevant to the loan, and we'll see what they decide.
Q: Was Khalil Diq* the ringleader of this Jordanian terrorist cell that was being financed by Osama bin Laden and his associates? And with his arrest, do you believe that the threat against Americans and American interests in Jordan has been nullified?
MR. LOCKHART: I'm not going to get into the details. I think, obviously, there will be proceedings taken against those arrested in Jordan. So I don't think it's proper to try to characterize what role each person has played or may not have played. I think we - I think this was an important development, but I'm not in a position to say that there is not an ongoing threat.
Q: How did we miss out on the chance to extradite him to Jordan? How did we miss out over Jordan on the chance to extradite him from Pakistan?
MR. LOCKHART: I know that he has been extradited, but I don't know if there was a U.S. claim in that case.
Q: Joe, since you brought up the subject of impeachment, a year ago the White House - (laughter) --
MR. LOCKHART: Good, I like that, creative.
Q: It's a segue. A year ago the White House was asserting that Americans would increasingly come to see the impeachment as an exercise in partisanship. But a new poll shows a dramatic increase in the number of Americans who approve of the impeachment. Is the White House losing sort of the legacy spin war?
MR. LOCKHART: I don't have t slightest idea.
Q: Joe, is the President glad that his fellow Democrats in Maryland are prosecuting Linda Tripp for recording Monica's confessions without her knowledge, just as so many Presidents have in the Oval Office recorded people without their knowledge or consent? And I have a follow-up.
MR. LOCKHART: He has not expressed a view to me on that subject.
Q: What was the President's reaction to Vice President Gore's response in Derry, New Hampshire that he ""doesn't know"" what to make of Juanita Broaddrick charge that the Attorney General Bill Clinton raped her? Does the President think that the Vice President should be uncertain about a charge that he's a rapist, and Gore's answer ""no,"" when asked, ""so you don't believe Juanita's Broaddrick claim"" Had the President talked to Mr. Gore about this?
MR. LOCKHART: I don't have the slightest idea and --
Q: Could you ask?
MR. LOCKHART: No. Listen, Lester, you find it so easy to cross the line. I'm going to let you make your statements, but I don't have to respond to them.
Next.
Q: Cross the line - why is it crossing the line?
MR. LOCKHART: I say it's a free country, if you've got a question, ask it. Otherwise --
Q: I did.
MR. LOCKHART: Good.
Q: I didn't get an answer.
MR. LOCKHART: Is there anyone out there with a real question?
Q: Joe, what message does it send to Iraq that Russia, China and France today abstained from this U.N. vote adopting a resolution to return t arms teams and to let up on the sanctions?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, I think Russia and China have articulated reasons for their abstentions that speak for themselves. I think we believe it's unfortunate that France took the position they did. It doesn't completely add up for us, given the fact that they said they supported t text of the resolution.
But I think the bottom line is there was a strong majority that sent a strong message to Saddam Hussein and passed a strong resolution. This gives new powers to the U.N. Security Council, and he's got a fundamental decision to make, which he has faced in the past and he has tried to avoid. And this is another statement and resolution that puts the onus back on him to decide on whether he's going to allow the inspectors to come in, whether he's going to fulfill the disarmament task that they've waived for him, and whether he's going to cooperate and comply with the United Nations. If he does not do that, he lives in a world of sanctions.
Q: -- something beyond sanctions?
MR. LOCKHART: I'm not going to speculate down the road on a hypothetical, but I think this statement is a strong statement. I think it's been erroneously reported that somehow this weakens the U.N. Security Council position, because in fact it strengthens it.
Q: Joe, -- about Paris, of the U.S. effort to build an anti-missile defense. The Foreign Minister called us a ""hyper power"" instead of a superpower. Are the French becoming a part of the problem, as they often tend to be?
MR. LOCKHART: I believe and it's certainly our hope that the French will join us in pursuing full implementation of this resolution. I think, as I've said, we're disappointed that they abstained. But given t fact that they supported the text,
Q: Why did they abstain?
MR. LOCKHART: Again, it's something that doesn't make complete sense to us, but - and they can certainly articulate their views. But given their support of the text, support of the overall concept of applying this regime with Saddam Hussein and Iraq, it is disappointing. The bottom line, though, is that we have a U.N. resolution that provides additional power to the Security Council to go ahead and get this done, and we are in a situation where Saddam Hussein has got to decide whether to give up his weapons program and rejoin the international community, or remain isolated.
Q: Joe, what message does it send to the President that a September 27th deadline lasts for more than two months in the Section 201 steel wire --
MR. LOCKHART: That it's a highly complicated issue and that a lot of people are working very hard to get it resolved.
Q: When do you expect it resolved?
MR. LOCKHART: I expect it to be resolved soon.
Q: How do you read the Security Council decision as a strong majority when it was a pretty narrow margin --
MR. LOCKHART: I think 11 to 4 is - 4 abstentions - 11 to 0 voting for it, and 4 abstentions is a strong majority. I'll give you a lot of candidates who would take that vote.
Q: Joe, -- between U.S. and China over the - embassy - the U.S. will pay to China almost $28 million, and China will pay about $3 million. Do you think that will make China happy, and bring relations back to --
MR. LOCKHART: Well, we've been working hard on restoring relations with China over the last six months or so, with obvious progress in a number of areas, including our agreement on trade and accession into WTO. These were good negotiations between both sides. There was obviously damage to the U.S. embassy in China that was done in the aftermath of the accidental bombing. I think this is an appropriate resolution that will allow both sides to rebuild the damaged facilities.
Q: Also, -- has become part of China this week. Any comment on this -- because some - are saying that they want to be run --
MR. LOCKHART: I haven't heard anybody - I haven't heard respected foreign policy voices making that contention.
Q: Do you know whether t President is thinking of giving a lot of pardons on Christmas Eve, and can you project this coming week in terms of - we hear rumors that the President may go to Camp David for Christmas. Is that --
MR. LOCKHART: No, I think the President is staying here - as far as I know. If that changes I'll let you know. That's right, isn't it? Yes. I think it's a White House tradition, going back a long time, that around Christmastime the process that results in pardons are bundled together. I expect that to happen this year, but I've got no way of predicting how many there will be this year, or who. I just don't know.
Q: Joe, what was the President's reaction to former Marine Corps Commandant General Mundy's op-ed piece in this morning's New York Times, ""playing politics at the military's expense?""
MR. LOCKHART: Didn't talk to him about it.
Q: What was the President's reaction to Secretary Cohen's announcement at Dover Air Force Base that he has no plans to lift restrictions on open homosexuals in the Armed Forces, as unreported by both the Washington Post and the New York Times?
MR. LOCKHART: Didn't talk to him.
John..
Q: Don't talk to him about these things?
Q: Joe, the President of Montenegro is meeting with the Secretary of State and seeking assurances that the West will help out if Mr. Milosevic had any intentions of staging a coup or military action; also seeking some economic help. Do you know what the United States position is on that, and whether we see any evidence that Mr. Milosevic is up to something improper?
MR. LOCKHART: No evidence has been brought to my attention, although I don't want to exclude something that I'm not aware of. We've made a number of public statements on that about our views on their position, their autonomy. And I'm just not aware of anything new that's developed --
Q: What's the radio address on?
MR. LOCKHART: Radio address is on - we've got education and schools.
Q: Joe, the United Nations has in effect investigated itself on the Rwanda massacres. And the U.N. report is very critical of both the U.N. and of the United States. Now, the President has often expressed his regret during the massacres. When he went to Rwanda, he said we did not act quickly enough after the killing began, we should not have allowed the refugee camps to become safe havens for killers, we did not immediately call these crimes by their rightful name - genocide. So he's acknowledged mistakes there. Why were there mistakes? We've never really had an explanation for why the United States did not try to go in there, why it did not try to lead a relief effort before -- as the President said in Rwanda, --
MR. LOCKHART: Let me say I think you've accurately quoted the President. He has spoken about that both in the region and around this country. But this is an important report that's come from the United Nations, and one that we have not had a chance to review. So I'm going to withhold comment on that until we've had a chance. I have no reason not to believe it's not well-researched and analyzed, but our people here haven't had a chance to review it. I'm going to withhold.
Q: -- follow-up, without reference to the report, though, there are people - and not just African-Americans - in this country who say it would have been different, was different in fact in Bosnia, when whites were in danger there. Is there an explanation for the inaction -- without reference to this report, whether the report --
MR. LOCKHART: Well, I think it's difficult to do it without reference to the report, because the report's what's driving the question today. And I want to avoid my comments being misconstrued in any way. So let me stay where I am on that, and just point you back to -- I think the President has spoken extensively on this.
Q: Does the President feel he was able to make his points on trade any better, or with better reception, during the EU meeting - Seattle?
MR. LOCKHART: Let me kick that question only because they were coming out as I was walking down. Tony Blinken will be in here afterwards on some of the other issues. And then on the particular trade issues, I understand the United States Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky will have a session with reporters sometime very soon. And she's going to handle the particular trade issues.
Q: The week ahead?
MR. LOCKHART: Be glad to, but John hasn't been here for a while. Why don't - (laughter) - two days in a row.
Q: I'll defer to Lester. (Laughter.)
Q: I have a last question, Joe.
MR. LOCKHART: I wasn't going to use this threat, but I am going to use it now. We are in the process of formulating next week's Christmas lids, and I think we've just changed our minds. No early lids. (Laughter.) Thank Lester - just kidding. We're actually going to try next week. I'll do the week ahead if you're ready for it.
Q: Go ahead.
MR. LOCKHART: We're going to try to get you out as early as we can next week in our own self-interest. But Saturday, the President will conduct a live radio address. They will also have - the President and the First Lady will also host holiday receptions Saturday and Sunday --
Q: Both tomorrow and --
MR. LOCKHART: Tomorrow and Sunday on the receptions. No public schedule for the rest of the weekend.
Monday, December 20th, the President and the First Lady will host the annual children's holiday reading event, 1:30 p.m., East Room, pool press. For those of you who were there last year, we will not repeat my bravura performance of trying to talk my daughter off the First Lady's seat.
Tuesday, December 21st, the President will meet with President Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan, 9:30 a.m. in the morning. Wednesday, December 22nd, the President and the First Lady will visit the D.C. Central Kitchen to assist the kitchen in its holiday meal preparation. That's 12:15 p.m. I think that's the place we went to last year. Thursday, December 23rd through December 26th, the President will have no public schedule. I expect that he will remain at the White House for the holiday. And we will have more for you on Christmas lids early next week.
Q: Can you guarantee he won't go shopping on Christmas Eve evening?
MR. LOCKHART: I not only won't guarantee it, I'd actually tell you to prepare for it.
Q: Joe, with Barry moving on, who will now handle the arcane tax and budget questions that --
MR. LOCKHART: Well, Barry and I have spent a lot of time together, and he felt that the only person who was prepared, and who had the ability to do it was me. So every morning now after the gaggle, we're going to do an arcane budget-and-tax gaggle. (Laughter.) No, I think Mr. Siewert is well-equipped to steal that, and Mr. Kennedy will fill in as necessary.
Q: Joe, since Israel sent its top executive to Washington but Syria did not, and instead sent a Foreign Minister who refused to shake hands with Prime Minister Barak, and since General Ariel Sharon quotes General Barak as saying on August 18th, 1994, ""even in time of peace we must hold the Golan Heights,"" why does the President think Israel should give up the Golan Heights for Syrian promises and American money?
MR. LOCKHART: Lester, your question betrays extraordinary ignorance of the Middle East, so let's move on.
Q: Oh, that's --
Q: Tomorrow's radio, why is it going to be live? Are there going to be special guests about education in schools? And will there be any new initiatives --
MR. LOCKHART: There'll be some new initiatives, which I'll be glad to talk to you about - out there, once I get off and away from the cameras.
Q: Joe, on the Ex-Im Bank, can we go back to this? The President has the authority, right, if he sees that the loan is violating U.S. human rights policy, of stopping it, right?
MR. LOCKHART: My understanding of our policy is, we have the authority to block lending to countries. We don't go down to the lower level, specific loans to specific companies. So yes, we have the ability to do that if we feel that a country is not deserving of a loan. In this case, Ex-Im is making a decision. We've provided information to them, and we'll just see where they come down.
Q: -- shouldn't it be because of the human rights abuse that's taking place in Chechnya, not for some sort of obscure reasons relating to this particular company?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, I think the Export-Import Bank is making a decision based on a company. They're not making a broader political decision, no.
Q: So the administration is not trying to in any way weigh in on this and make a political decision that there should not be additional loans to Russia?
MR. LOCKHART: No. All I can say is there was relevant information about this loan that was provided.
Q: Two new questions today about security of Americans. They closed the embassy in Ecuador, and this arrest along the Canadian border. Can you just tell us what the White House thinks about these?
MR. LOCKHART: I don't know about the second one. I know about the first one. I know there was a specific threat that led to the closing of the embassy in Quito, and that is being addressed. I'm just not aware of the second. All I can say is that we remain vigilant in this time on threats to Americans, and to American facilities, and we will remain very vigilant.
Q: Joe, going back on Osama bin Laden. What message do you have for the rest of the world, because most of the public, really they are scared from the threats and from the statements and from press reportings that there might be something coming from him. Is anybody watching him? And also, what the rest of the world's publics should do?
MR. LOCKHART: I think the warning that the State Department put out was very clear that during this time, it is appropriate for Americans to exercise caution and to get more information, depending on what their travel schedule is.
Q: Joe, one more on the Ex-Im Bank. So you're saying that if this loan is turned down, it should not be interpreted by the Russians as any statement by the U.S. on their policy in Chechnya?
MR. LOCKHART: I'm saying that the Export-Import Bank is making a decision. That is something that they will make independent of the White House. And we should wait until a decision is made before we speculate on how it should be read, either here or abroad.
Q: Yes, but if the U.S. has the right to suggest that there could be human rights violations, does that mean that the U.S. does not believe there are human rights violations in Chechnya? And therefore won't suggest that --
MR. LOCKHART: I wouldn't draw a straight line between these two things.
Q: Has there been any direct communication between the President and Boris Yeltsin since Yeltsin rattled sabers last week and said that we have nukes?
MR. LOCKHART: Not that I'm aware of, no.
Q: How can we draw any other conclusion on the Russians, in view of the timing? Did we suddenly discover this information about fraud about one company, and then --
MR. LOCKHART: Listen, I'm not going to get into the information --
Q: -- so gratuitous.
MR. LOCKHART: Well, you know what? You can draw your own conclusions based on what information you have.
Q: We expect the government to tell us these things.
MR. LOCKHART: And I am not at liberty to give you any more information than I'm giving you now, beyond that we had relevant information and we passed it on to the proper authorities.
Q: Thank you.

Bill Clinton,"December 17, 1999",Press Briefing by Senior Director for European Affairs Tony Blinken,"The Briefing Room
1:55 P.M. EST
MR. FALLON: We have Tony Blinken available. He is the Senior Director for European Affairs and will give a readout. This is on the record, and it's on the foreign policy aspects of today's U.S.-E.U. Summit.
MR. BLINKEN: Good afternoon. I notice a distinct drop-off from the Barry Toiv briefing -- (laughter) -- but I will nonetheless do my best to give you a quick readout of what was discussed at the U.S.-E.U. Summit and try and answer any questions you may have.
I want to just focus on the foreign policy aspects of this. Charlene Barshefsky, the U.S. Trade Representative is going to be doing a briefing, I believe later today, as Joe indicated, covering the economic aspects. So I'll just touch on them, but save any details for her.
First, just on exactly what happened in terms of the format, the President first met in the Oval Office with his counterparts, that is, the other leaders -- Finnish President Ahtisaari and Prime Minister Lipponen. The Finns, as you know, are in the presidency, the rotating presidency of the European Union right now; and also the European Union President Prodi.
They met for about an hour and focused their discussions on diplomatic and security questions. Then they moved into the Cabinet Room and the ministers from both sides came in and they focused that discussion on economic issues that Charlene will talk about later.
Q: Do you know if that's going to be here?
MR. BLINKEN: I don't know. You'll have to ask my colleagues, but I believe it's later this afternoon.
On the session on foreign and security policy, the President began the meeting by praising the EU leadership for their success at the Helsinki Summit that ended last weekend. In particular, he singled out the EU's decisions to proceed with enlarging the European Union, adding six countries to the list of those who are actually beginning accession negotiations with the European Union: Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, Romania, Bulgaria and Malta.
They join six countries who have already begun accession discussions: Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Slovenia and Cyprus. And of course, he emphasized how pleased w were that the EU had offered, and Turkey had accepted, candidate status for membership in the Union.
The President emphasized, beyond the question of Turkey, that the decision to put Romania and Bulgaria in line to start these accession talks was something we thought was very, very positive for both of those countries.
The other issue that the President raised in terms of the Helsinki Summit was the question of European security and defense policy. Again, he praised the leaders of the European Union for the decisions they had taken to strengthen the European Union's capabilities for conducting defense policy, and also the emphasis it placed on the central role of NATO in our common defense and security.
He suggested that as we go forward, and as the EU goes forward, it would be important to focus on the links between NATO and the EU as the EU develops this capacity to strengthen our common defense and security.
After they talked about the Helsinki Summit, the discussion focused heavily on Southeast Europe. And the President and the leaders touched on a number of different subjects in relation to Southeast Europe. They talked about Kosovo. I think as many of you know, the EU pledged $2.5 billion for Kosovo between now and the year 2004; but there was an agreement on both sides on the need to be able to get these resources and the resources that we're dedicating to Kosovo into the field as quickly and as effectively as possible.
In particular, to support the work of the U.N. mission in Kosovo, to be able to pay civil servants, teachers, police and also money for the Kosovo Protection Corps. Both sides agreed that this was vitally important, it wasn't enough to simply commit the funds that we've committed, we actually had to get them into the field quickly and effectively.
They talked as some length about the Stability Pact for Southeastern Europe more broadly. There again, I think it's worth pointing out that the EU pledged some time ago to spend $12 billion between now and 2006 on the broader region. And that sum may go higher as the member states also contribute to this process. And already, under the Stability Pact, there are a number of very solid initiatives that were announced in Istanbul, initiatives on investment, fight corruption, on small arms, on weapons of mass destruction.
The leaders agreed that the key next step is a regional funding conference that will take place in March; and, in particular, pledge to work closely together to develop this conference; and, in particular, to develop projects that have a real and quick impact on people's lives in the region.
They then turned to a discussion of Russia and, in particular, Chechnya. And there again there was strong agreement -- and here I would refer you to a joint statement that I believe is going to be issued this afternoon in the name of the European Union and the United States on this. Both the European Union and the United States agreed that they strongly support Russia's right to defend its territorial integrity to combat terrorism; but that we both shared a very deep concern about the impact on civilians, the loss of civilian life, the indiscriminate use of force.
And we also deeply share a conviction that the only possible outcome to this situation is a political outcome -- a political dialogue, a political solution. And that the goals that Russia seeks to advance in Chechnya, we believe the means it is using are counterproductive to those goals. And both sides agreed on that and I think that's reflected in the joint statement.
They discussed briefly Ukraine. And the President described to his counterparts at the meeting he had recently with Mr. Kuchma, who was here, and, in particular, the strong expression that Mr. Kuchma made of the need to move forward on reform. The President pointed out that the new Prime Minister designate in Ukraine is someone who is very highly regarded here in the United States. The Europeans agreed that he was highly regarded in Europe. They also noted that the reform plan that the Ukrainians had put forward to cut the size of their government was quite impressive. And both agreed strongly on the need to continue to strongly support Ukraine.
Finally, in this Oval Office session, the President gave his counterparts a quick readout on the Middle East peace talks, on the talks between Israel and Syria here at the White House. And let me leave it at that. I know we've made statements on that in the last day.
The final issue that came up -- this in the larger session with the ministers, but it is a foreign security issue of sorts -- is on the question of judicial and law enforcement cooperation. The European Union is taking important strides to harmonize its own laws on things like visa policy, immigration policy, law enforcement, judicial procedures. And the President made the point that as they do this it would be very useful for us to be able to work with them to harmonize between the United States and the European Union. We have a lot of bilateral agreements with individual countries, and those agreements are impacted as the EU harmonizes its own regulations, and there was an agreement on the need to cooperate on that.
As I said, Charlene Barshefsky will cover the trade and economic issues that were discussed, let me just list them for you so that you know what was discussed, and then I'll let Charlene handle any of the specifics. They of course talked about that recent Seattle summit and WTO. They talked about China and the WTO. They talked about biotechnology. And they talked about a number of trade disputes that continue to linger between the United States and the European Union on some of our favorites -- bananas, beef hormones, hush kits and also the Foreign Sales Corporation. But Charlene will get into all of that in more detail later.
Finally, let me say, and let me refer you to a number of joint statements that are being issued, or may have already been issued as a result of this summit -- one on Chechnya that I mentioned, another on Southeast Europe; a third on small arms and working to combat the proliferation of small arms; a fourth one on Northern Europe and our common efforts with the European Union to deepen our engagement with the Nordic countries, with the Baltic countries and also with Russia. And, finally, a statement on trade and on the WTO that is coming out.
And with that, any questions?
Q: Tony, on Chechnya, was there anything beyond a condemnation of what Russia is doing? Was there any discussion of any kind of sanctions or any kind of action that can be taken, other than writing down words on a piece of paper?
MR. BLINKEN: Well, I think there was a very lengthy discussion of Chechnya and Kosovo. I don't want to get into any of the details of that discussion; but, clearly, they looked at what we've been doing and what we've been saying, what we can be doing and saying going forward. And let me leave it at that.
Q: What is the ""doing"" part?
MR. BLINKEN: I don't want to get into that now. Let me simply say that there is a clear agreement between the United States and the European Union on the need for Russia to engage in a political process to try and bring this crisis to a close. We have, as you know, at the summit in Istanbul, urged -- and the OSCE agreed -- that it could play a role, not only on the humanitarian side, but also perhaps in facilitating a political dialogue. The European Union leaders reported on some conversations they've had recently with the Russian leadership. People on our side did the same. And I think there was a strong agreement that we need to continue to encourage Russia very strongly to pursue a political solution to this crisis.
I think the very strong, unified approach that we've seen from the European Union and the United States -- the European Union in Helsinki, our own statements on this -- has certainly gotten Russia's attention. We don't want Russia to be isolated from the international community; Russia certainly doesn't want that. And there's a concern that as this crisis goes on and civilian casualties mount, that that could be one result.
The bottom line and the main point is that we have -- the European Union and the United States -- Russia's interests at heart and we are simply convinced that the means they are choosing to advance those interests are counterproductive, and that was the conviction of the leaders on both sides.
Q: Did the Ex-Im vote come up specifically?
MR. BLINKEN: No.
Q: In terms of -- French officials in recent interviews indicated that the creation of the 60,000-man force is really to counteract U.S. power in Europe. And that that's the whole M.O., they'll be tied to NATO. What's our feeling about it?
MR. BLINKEN: The President expressed our feeling very clearly to his counterparts. He said -- this is not a direct quote, but this is the import of what he said, that Europe's efforts to develop greater defense and security capabilities are something that the United States strongly supports.
You know, a lot of our predecessors for years have been complaining that the Europeans didn't do enough to share the burden of common defense and security. And now that they are, in fact, working to do that, in our view it would by hypocritical for us to say, no, they shouldn't.
So the President has been on record repeatedly as strongly supporting this. And he repeated that strong support today. This is something that, as Europe develops more capabilities, is something that's very good for our common defense and security, and is good for NATO. It will allow more assets to be dedicated to NATO operations. And where NATO chooses not to be engaged in a particular mission or operation, it will give the European Union capabilities to handle these things.
The one thing the President focused on was that he's convinced that as this goes forward, as the European Union develops its policy, there need to be very clear and strong links between NATO and the European Union so that we can coordinate as well as possible. But the main point is, this is something that he and the administration strongly support.
Q: You said that our warnings or our concerns about Chechnya has been heard in Moscow, and President Ahtisaari said the same thing. And today Moscow has launched a three-prong attack on Grozny, with tank fire coming in from like three different directions. What evidence do you have that Moscow has heard anything on the ground? What evidence on the ground do you have of that?
MR. BLINKEN: Well, first of all I'm not at all aware of the reports you're referring to, so I just can't comment on them. But certainly the indications we've had and the statements that Russian officials have made in recent days lead us to believe that certainly they're very well aware of the strong, unified position of the international community, and particularly the United States and Europe, on the way they're conducting the operations in Chechnya; our conviction that it's counterproductive; our conviction that the loss of civilian life, casualties, damage, is something of deep concern to all of us. And we believe they're hearing that message.
Q: They're hearing you, they're just not listening to you.
MR. BLINKEN: Well, again, I can't comment on the reports that this gentleman raised. I just am not aware of them.
Q: But you can comment, certainly, on the fact that the Russians have been attacking Grozny all week. Maybe you don't know this particular day, but an armored column went into Grozny -- I think it was on Wednesday -- and got decimated.
MR. BLINKEN: Again, I think those reports which I've heard, I haven't seen confirmed. I'm not the Russia expert, but I haven't seen confirmation of a lot of the reports that we've been hearing.
Q: Basically what is the political solution that they have to discuss? And, number two, you said that the statement respects Russian fighting terrorism and all that. But do you think terrorists are using civilians as a shield? How do you solve this problem when the fighting is going on?
MR. BLINKEN: I don't want to get into the details of the Russian Chechnya policy. My mission today is to describe for you what they discussed. Those kind of details weren't discussed. I'd rather leave that to my colleagues who are more expert in these issues.
Q: Can you give me the full names of those who were saw President?
MR. BLINKEN: Sure.
Q: Thank you.

Bill Clinton,"December 20, 1999",Press Briefing by Joe Lockhart,"The Briefing Room
11:17 A.M EST
MR. LOCKHART: Hello, everybody. Welcome. In an effort to try to let you all enjoy the run up through Christmas, we'll have a different schedule this week. I'll try to do this at around this time now through Wednesday. I think Thursday and Friday I'll try to do nothing -- ""try"" is the operative word there. But let me just run through the President's schedule, since we didn't get a chance to see each other this morning.
The President, at 10:00 a.m., had a meeting with the First Minister, David Trimble, from Northern Ireland. Mr. Trimble came in, I think they will have a general discussion of the peace process there -- I think with the implementation of the Good Friday accords, you'll remember there was a breakthrough in those discussions while we were in Seattle, that the President commented on. He may, at the end of that session, come out to the stake out. If he does, someone will wave at me and I'll get off quickly for those of you who want to go out or stay on, if that's what you'd rather do.
The President now is in a State of the Union meeting. He's got a meeting with his policy advisors and speechwriters. It's, I think, the first session that he's had with them. I know they've exchanged, they've sent some memos in that he's commented on. But it's a chance before we leave for the Christmas break for the President to give them some direction for that important speech. The President will have another in a series of his budget meetings, I think the fifth or sixth of the last two weeks, as that process needs to wind up, from a decision making point of view, by the end of the week so the OMB staffers can actually write the budget and get that work done by the deadline.
And at 1:35 p.m. today, we have the annual Children's Holiday reading event, which we know you all love to cover, the President and the First Lady love to do -- and I will not be providing side entertainment this year, for those of you who remember last year's event. A certain person is being left at home.
Q: What? (Laughter.)
MR. LOCKHART: There are a couple of people in the room who know what I'm talking about, like Mr. McQuillan. For the rest of you, too bad. Questions?
Q: Is the Jonathan Pollard release under active consideration? And would it be a part of the Middle East peace package, in terms of Syria? I mean, this is the speculation. Of course, there's a lot of pressure. And apparently, there was some meeting here --
MR. LOCKHART: There was a meeting last week. As I understand it, traveling with Prime Minister Barak was his representative who has been dealing with this issue. He had not had a chance to sit down and meet the new White House Counsel, so there was a session where they went through the process. I believe they've gotten all the input that they're going to get, but no recommendation has gone to the President.
But, no, I expect this to be dealt with on the merits, and not part of the overall process -- the ongoing Middle East peace process.
Q: Is it under active consideration for Christmas or New Year's?
MR. LOCKHART: I would steer you away from that.
Q: But the review is complete now, Joe, that he started last --
MR. LOCKHART: I think they've gotten all the information, as far as I know. They have checked in all the places they need to check in, but no recommendation has gone to the President.
Q: When is that recommendation likely to go to him? Are we talking a matter of days, weeks?
MR. LOCKHART: I don't expect anything to happen imminently on this.
Q: And who makes the recommendation? Ms. Nolan make it, or --
MR. LOCKHART: Well, she has assumed this responsibility from the previous White House Counsel, Chuck Ruff, and has the responsibility for making a recommendation to the President on it.
Q: The First Lady is being urged by some Jewish groups in New York to play a role in this decision. Do you -- can you say whether or not she is?
MR. LOCKHART: She has not played a role, nor do I expect her to.
Q: Joe, another 200 people, or over 200 people were arrested in Pakistan in connection with this terrorism activities, including this on the Canadian and U.S. border. Now, number one, what were they doing? Were they getting training in Pakistan, or where they come from --
MR. LOCKHART: My understanding from the Pakistani authorities disputes the question, which is, they arrested a number of individuals, up to 200, in connection with criminal activity in Pakistan. I think a Minister of Finance, one of the Ministers of Finance was murdered. So while this is a serious law enforcement operation in Pakistan, I'd exercise some caution in drawing any linkage to terrorist activity and other groups that have received a lot of attention.
Q: I'm sorry, just to follow, some reports are saying it may be the timing. The new Pakistani ambassador just arrived here, and at the same time they were arrested there, so there may be some kind of hand-over to the U.S. authorities in connection with the Osama bin Laden group.
MR. LOCKHART: Well, again, my understanding of the situation is it has to do with a domestic criminal investigation which, while very serious in its nature, is not necessarily connected to the kind of international terrorism that we've spent a good bit of time engaging both with Pakistan and a number of other countries on.
Q: Joe, given the results of the Duma election, do you think it's more important now for the IMF to go ahead with these loan guarantees to Russian institutions? And I understand there's a decision that's supposed to be made as early as tomorrow.
MR. LOCKHART: Well, I think what you're talking about is not the IMF, it's the Export-Import Bank.
Q: Right.
MR. LOCKHART: And they are in the process of making their decision. They, as their charter indicates, make decisions based on economic and commercial considerations. They are in the process, as I said on Friday. The administration has provided information we believe is relevant, and at this point I have nothing further to report on that.
Q: Can you say what the administration's position is?
MR. LOCKHART: The Export-Import Bank makes these decisions independent, based on commercial considerations. We have, under the Chafee amendment, the ability to block loans based on national interests clause and there have obviously been discussions about that, but no decision.
Q: So it's not so independent, really. I mean, much is riding on the U.S. and the White House seems to be going through a lot of agony on this.
MR. LOCKHART: This is not multi-lateral lending. This is a U.S. line of credit that goes out from the Export-Import Bank. So it's loan guarantees that a part of the United States government makes a decision on. And they are, based on their own internal structure -- they only look at the commercial viability and the economic issues. Under the Chafee amendment to their rules, the government has the right to block a transaction based on national interest, but no decision has been made on that.
Q: Joe, what concerns does the administration have on how Canada is monitoring terrorism, or potential terrorists operating in Canada? And have those concerns been transmitted to the Canadian government?
MR. LOCKHART: I will note that we have excellent cooperation with Canada. I think as you've seen over the last few days there cooperation and I don't know that any particular concern has been transmitted.
Q: Joe, has the President made a final decision on whether he will seek a reimbursement of any of his legal expenses from the independent counsel investigation?
MR. LOCKHART: No. It's premature to answer the question or even ask it, as that couldn't be done until the independent counsel has wrapped up its operations.
Q: Well, is he considering it?
MR. LOCKHART: I don't know. There are a lot of decisions he's got to make right now; and decisions that are down the road, he'll make when he gets down the road.
Q: Joe, there are other employees who have requested reimbursement for their legal fees. Is that under a separate legal provision for which the President isn't eligible?
MR. LOCKHART: My understanding of this -- which is very limited -- is that there is a provision by those who are covered under the statute, the independent counsel statute, which is a small number of people, rather than those who -- you know, staffers or those who get caught up in -- there's not that many staff people here who are covered under the statute.
Q: Do you know if the United States is going to be supplying aid to those flooded in Venezuela?
MR. LOCKHART: Yes, let me give you a sense. Obviously, as the President indicated on Friday, this is quite a tragedy, which proportions grow with each passing day. We have been on the forefront of the international relief effort. We immediately provided three helicopters and C-130 aircraft to help in rescue and relief operations. Those helicopters flew about 150 sorties a day over the weekend, rescuing people from remote and isolated areas.
In addition, we are now sending seven additional helicopters and will stage six C-130s out of Puerto Rico to assist in moving both people and material. The U.N. Southern Command CINC, Charles Wilhelm, is in Caracas today to assess whatever further needs the Venezuelan government might have.
On the USAID front, the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance had sent a disaster response team there and additional experts are on the way today. One charter flight has already arrived with much needed blankets, plastic sheeting, water storage and carrying containers and other commodities that are useful in these disasters. Another charter flight is expected to arrive today.
We will continue working with the Venezuelan government to see, as the days unfold this week, how we can be more helpful. There has been a number of countries in the region who have also answered the call. And I think the Venezuelan government has moved forward very aggressively in trying to meet this disaster.
Q: A couple of follow ups. One on the terrorism in general, as we go toward Y2K now. Is there anything different in this building, in terms of briefing the President, or activities in the NSC? What can you tell us about what's going on here on a day-to-day basis? Sort of in a --
MR. LOCKHART: Well, I think John Koskinen has run a fairly remarkable operation over the last year to prepare the federal government and to help prepare state and local governments, communities, schools, businesses, to meet the challenge of Y2K. And I think, as his final reports indicate, from the federal government's point of view we're ready. From most state and local governments, they're ready. There are pockets of areas where there's some concern. But they don't expect there to be any real level of unpreparedness here. That is obviously taking up increasingly more time of the administration, but has gone forward in a very methodical way under Mr. Koskinen's direction.
As far as the President's time, I mean, he's been fully briefed throughout the year, and particularly as we move closer, to what we're doing, and I think will be briefed through the command center operation that Koskinen has set up here in Washington through the day -- New Year's Eve and New Year's Day.
Q: But is Koskinen involved in terrorist threats?
MR. LOCKHART: No, I'm sorry. I thought this was about Y2K.
Q: Well, that's one aspect of it, but certainly there's now, with the arrest, there's the terrorist aspect of it. And how has that changed things in this building, if at all, in terms of briefings and alert status, that sort of thing?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, I think you know on the worldwide front that the State Department's travel advisory went out now probably eight or nine days ago. And the law enforcement community in this country, and intelligence operations around the world, have been working diligently. I mean, I can't tell you that there's anything material that I can point to, as far as activity in this building, beyond a lot of work that goes into protecting against these threats.
Q: Is it occupying more of the President's time, though, Joe?
MR. LOCKHART: I think as things go, because it's an issue of concern, it probably is occupying more of his time than, say, two months ago. But we have ongoing efforts that look at both international terrorism and protecting against domestic terrorism. That work is something that the President has closely involved himself in, and has done a lot of work on.
Q: Joe, has the President been briefed specifically on what transpired in Washington state on Friday of last week? And are there any national security implications to what happened?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, I think the President has been kept up to date on the situation there, and up to date on the latest information that law enforcement has been able to gather.
Q: Has the President purchased a lot of water, and is he getting some extra cash out of the bank?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, he can always rely on Kris Engskov if he runs out of cash -- (laughter) -- which happens from time to time. I don't know about particular --
Q: He doesn't carry any cash?
MR. LOCKHART: I think that -- John Koskinen has spoken to this in a number of forums and a number of groups. And his advice -- and I think it's sage advice -- is that people shouldn't overreact, but there are some modest steps -- I think he described it as preparing like you get a weather report that a storm may be coming in -- and just preparing yourself just in case there is a temporary disruption of power or something like that.
Q: But, Joe, the President is in touch with the world leaders as far as terrorism and Y2K problem is concerned. Now, if other governments fail, then what kind of communications will the President have, or option to be in touch?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, I think one of the real areas of work and concern has been, because we live in an interdependent world, how other countries are prepared. I think there have been a series of reports done on that. And we have worked closely with foreign governments to help them meet the Y2K challenge, and to also understand the potential impact that it might have domestically, and to be prepared for that.
Q: Joe, Starr has exonerated the President on Filegate and Travelgate. And he said publicly that he's not going to seek indictments on the original Whitewater issue. In that way, those cases have been closed. So wouldn't it be appropriate now to be considering the reimbursement, on at least those issues?
MR. LOCKHART: No, because that's just not the way it works. The way the system works, as described for me, is the Independent Counsel at some point in the future will shut down their operation, and there's plenty of time to consider these items. I mean, I will leave it to you all to try to figure out why the Independent Counsel now is spending time preparing objections to something that hasn't been raised. You know, there's an element of mischief here, but they can describe for themselves why they get up to mischief and the --
Q: Joe, you said the President hasn't made a decision on that matter. Vice President Gore said yesterday that, in his view anyway, he thinks the President has a right to be reimbursed. Do you think the President has a right to be reimbursed? Does the Counsel here think that?
MR. LOCKHART: The statute is clear. You should all go and read the statute. But I'll tell you something: I'm not going to get drawn into a silly debate that some mischievous people want people to have for their own political reasons. I'm just not going to do it. If you have some reporting of analysis that's been done, or some decision that's been done, go ahead and report it, but don't expect that from me.
Q: Are you really saying that this is all a facade, a fraud -- that there is no consideration at all?
MR LOCKHART: I'm saying go report the story. I'm saying that if you all want to show me the legal analysis that was done, if you want to show me the decision memos or the meeting times --
Q: Well, we want to ask you if the President's thinking of it.
MR. LOCKHART: I'm telling you, there are certainly legal options that will be available, but it is premature to look at it. There is a legal trust right now that's raising money to pay the bills. And that's where it stands. Mary?
Q: How much does he owe?
Q: Excuse me --
MR. LOCKHART: I'd talk to the trust.
Q: It's a lot of money.
Q: Excuse me if you feel you've answered this before, but I am not clear. The number of absolutely innocent White House staff people who spent hours with Al D'Amato, which I think should be reimbursed on its own, do they have to apply independently or would they come under the President's --
MR. LOCKHART: My understanding -- and I would check with the lawyers -- I think they are covered by a different statute. The Independent Counsel has a number of people who are covered by it because of -- and, thankfully, we don't have this anymore, but when it was here, there were a number of people who Congress, in their wisdom, thought the Justice Department could not effectively look at, and they would take a step to go to Independent Counsel.
Those people who are covered are offered some potential relief based on the merits and a decision that the courts make. I think other people have potential relief. My guess is that the criteria is roughly the same, but it's covered by a different statute, as I understand it.
Q: Joe, what's your reaction to the Russian elections?
MR. LOCKHART: I think what we've seen from the OSCE who honor them -- the initial reporting is that they meet the standards of free and fair. I think all sides there on the Russian government indicated concern that we share with the tenor of the campaign. It was a very rough and tumble campaign. But I think, most importantly, taking a step back, it says something about the system in Russia where elections are becoming more common, where the turnout is so strong, and the democratic institutions, regardless of what you think of who won and who lost, have become accepted as the norm, and that's a positive.
Q: The results are basically an endorsement of the Chechnya policy that the rest of the world is condemning Russia for. Does that make it harder to stop, or to have any influence over the Russian government as they continue to pound away in Grozny?
MR. LOCKHART: Obviously, the domestic political audience may view it different than the international community does. But the international community is united in its condemnation of the tactics that are being used. As the President has said repeatedly, he believes that the policy is counterproductive, that it only emboldens the enemies of Russia and will not provide without an active political dialogue a solution to this.
Q: That message isn't getting through. Is there anything else that can be done, especially now that their government is going to feel ratified in its campaign, to get that message through?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, again, I think this is a situation where the international community is going to have to continue to make the case to the Russian government and to the Russian people about how the rest of the world sees this.
Q: Joe, were actions of government officials or the media's reporting of the actions about Wen Ho Lee unfair in the White House's opinion?
MR. LOCKHART: Obviously, this is something that's subject to litigation, which would be inappropriate for me to make any comment on. And as far as the media, you all will have to judge your own behavior on your own.

Bill Clinton,"December 21, 1999",Press Briefing by Joe Lockhart,"The Briefing Room
1:44 P.M. EST
MR. LOCKHART: Okay, Helen.
Q: Terrorism. Had a meeting on terrorism here?
MR. LOCKHART: There's a group of people who work on counterterrorism issues that meet on a fairly regular basis with - interagency. I think as we lead up to the millennium and the issues that that brings on, and with some of the things that have been in the news, the group has been meeting. I don't want to get into their schedules, when and where they do their meetings, but you can assume that it's a group that gets together on a regular basis.
Q: Was there an emergency meeting with all the top Cabinet people today?
MR. LOCKHART: No emergency meeting that I know of.
Q: Well, this was not just an interagency, this was Cabinet secretaries for that level. Did they come up with any results, anything new?
MR. LOCKHART: I'm not going to try to read out or provide too many details on the logistics of meetings beyond that there's a group of people that concern themselves with these issues that meet on a fairly regular basis.
Q: The American people are concerned, since there is sort of a scare mode around and this emanating from Washington, so I think you ought to tell us.
MR. LOCKHART: I don't think that there is a scare mode. And if there is one, I think you all have to look at how you look at these issues and how they're reported. I think we have provided, both in the times when there are interview possibilities and with the State Department, with their system of advisories, the best information we can about the caution that needs to be taken.
Q: But, Joe, based upon what the U.S. government now knows about the possibility of domestic terrorism around the millennium, is it something that people should be concerned about, or not?
MR. LOCKHART: I think we have made the case in the past that the U.S. is not invulnerable to domestic terrorism, but there's no specific information now about particular targets here. But I think given the - as we've said, as we head into the millennium, it pays for people to be cautious and vigilant.
Q: Let me follow up on that. You say there's no specific information about particular targets. Does that mean that our best analysis is that this Seattle thing was not targeting Seattle's millennium festival?
MR. LOCKHART: We don't have - we are investigating that, and that is ongoing. But we don't have specific or general threats against particular targets in the U.S.
Q: You keep emphasizing in the U.S. After the arrests abroad and the State Department declaration, is there still concern about a specific target abroad?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, I think as we've said in the aftermath of the arrest, the travel advisory warning from the State Department remains in effect.
Q: So that's where the caution comes from?
MR. LOCKHART: Listen, the State Department I think has been very clear in issuing their travel advisories. There's been several in the last three or four months.
Q: It's only on travel.
MR. LOCKHART: I think we have vigorous law enforcement efforts ongoing now in the U.S., looking at the incident of last week, and we've, from several levels, indicated the wisdom of people being cautious. But there is, at this point, I can't report to you any specific threat against particular American targets here at home.
Q: Joe, the CIA said that there may be 50 terrorist groups operating in Canada. Do you have concerns about the Canadian government's counterterrrorism efforts and their ability?
MR. LOCKHART: I'm not going to get into the particulars of what the CIA has said or has not said, but we have worked closely and effectively with the Canadian government on this issue and many others.
Q: Joe, I don't want to parse your words too much, but I just want to - you just said, ""no particular American targets here at home."" So are there particular American targets abroad?
MR. LOCKHART: No, I meant that -- I didn't mean that to lead itself to being parsed. Let me rephrase it to particular targets here in the U.S. that we've received. Now, obviously, the State Department advisory remains in effect for around the world, which they were very clear about what they were, which is - I don't have it in front of me here, but it talked about millennium and large crowds and things. I don't have any further information on that, I don't have any way to update.
Q: Just to follow up, that was more sort of a generic warning about Americans traveling abroad. Do we have information about a specific target of Americans abroad?
MR. LOCKHART: As the State Department has said - and I don't want to repeat what they said to make it news today - I would go back and look at what they've said and look at what we said over the weeks, because there's nothing that's changed.
Q: Did the President attend the meeting?
Q: You said that nothing has changed.
MR. LOCKHART: Nothing has changed, and I've gone through this a couple times. I know you haven't been here, but I'm not going to go into and try to recreate everything we've done over the last two weeks.
Q: But there's a separation between being vigilant just because there's the heightened risk for these specific dates and asking if there's a specific target that we know of. I'm not asking you to name a target. Are we concerned about a specific target?
MR. LOCKHART: And I think the advisory that was issued addressed that, and the comments in the aftermath of the advisory addressed that.
Q: Did the President attend that meeting? The President? Who conducted that meeting?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, listen. Let me answer it this way. The President has not attended any meeting in the last couple days of the interagency group that meets on this.
Q: Joe, that advisory covers, as I understand it, everywhere in the world except the United States. Would it be prudent for people in the United States -- is there any reason to think the U.S. is exempt from whatever threats there are around the world? And secondly, who has authority - the State Department doesn't have jurisdiction here - who has the authority to issue that kind of a warning?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, there's - listen, the reality is the State Department has something that's come in the aftermath of - what, 10 years ago or so, this policy's been - of a double standard, which is, when the State Department communicates with government employees or officials around the world, they now have an obligation to let the American public have access to the same information. That is the basis for which they issue these advisories. And as you know, these advisories are issued from time to time concerning a particular part of the world or worldwide. So that is the basis for which the State Department moves forward.
I don't know. There is not - as far as I know, there is not a similar domestic policy on that. If there were specific threats that law enforcement agencies and the U.S. government needed to make, they would -- somewhere within that group, some information could be conveyed. But there isn't the same system that there is with the State Department.
Q: To what extent did Secretary Albright's decision to block the Russian oil agreement have to do with the situation -
Q: Can we stay on this before we go to that?
MR. LOCKHART: Sure.
Q: One more question? What we have here is actually instead of someone just planning something against American fraud, we actually have someone coming into the United States with 100 pounds of explosives.
MR. LOCKHART: Right.
Q: Under those circumstances, why isn't some greater warning, some more urgent warning?
MR. LOCKHART: Because, Jim, we're looking into this. And law enforcement officials and customs officials and all the people who are charged with this are doing a lot of work, and they are following the facts as they are able to put them together. And I think public officials are being quite open and accessible on this subject, but they don't have the answers yet.
I understand your desire to wrap this all up and have the answers quickly, but the work is being done and I think people have been quite up front at all levels.
Q: That's not fair. What we're asking is, does the U.S. government know something about threats of terrorism more than just this general fear that's out there?
MR. LOCKHART: Are you talking domestic or foreign? I think we
Q: Both.
MR. LOCKHART: I think we were very clear that there was credible information, information gathered - including information gathered from arrests in Jordan - about potential terrorist threats. And we have made clear that there is a travel advisory, people should exercise caution. And, if people are planning to travel, they should be in touch with the consulate or embassies wherever they're planning to go to get further information. I think we have been clear.
On the domestic front, we don't have anything specific to report.
Q: Apparently, the INS is beefing up the borders, as you have told us here over the last couple of days, specifically sending agents to these unmanned posts, that aren't manned 24 hours a day. Why are they taking that action now? It seems like that's something that would have been logically done much earlier.
MR. LOCKHART: Well, I would refer you to Customs on that issue. But they obviously have moved in the case that you are well aware of, and they're taking steps that they believe are appropriate to deal with it.
Q: Is it fair to say, Joe, that would be something that t law enforcement agencies would be concerned about, that something could have happened at these unmanned entry points?
MR. LOCKHART: I'd ask you to go ask the law enforcement officials.
Q: To what extent does the situation, or did the situation, in Chechnya impact on Secretary Albright's decision to intervene on the Russian oil?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, what do you mean by ""intervene""?
Q: Recommend that the loan not be approved, postponed indefinitely.
MR. LOCKHART: I don't know of any connection between what's going on in Chechnya. The problems that the administration has articulated with the loan have to do with the company and their business practices. And I think we've made clear that we've referred information to the Export-Import Bank. The State Department has done the same. The Secretary has talked to Mr. Harmon, the head of the Export-Import Bank and they'll be making their decision.
Q: I thought that you had said that the administration would not exercise any political influence over the decision unless it blocked all loans -- to Russia because of human rights consideration?
MR. LOCKHART: No. And I think I may have indicated that in a gaggle, and that was in error. We do have the authority to block specific loans, which was my mistake. We have the authority under the Chafee amendment. It's been used six or seven times, I believe, since the amendment passed - so, very infrequently. But it does not have to apply to a country.
There are a number of illustrative examples in the legislative language about kinds of things, but certainly not limited to. It comes down to what we believe can be phrased as ""national interest,"" and is not solely limited to human rights or security. There just are a number of illustrative examples that are there to provide examples rather than limits.
Q: So the Russians should not interpret the Secretary of State's actions as having anything to do with their policy in Chechnya?
MR. LOCKHART: They should not. They should view concerns that we have about business practices, rule of law, transparency, corruption. That's how they should view it.
Q: When you refer to that, are you talking about the case with BP/Amoco, where this Tyumen Oil Company seized another company that BP/Amoco had a stake in?
MR. LOCKHART: I'm talking about - that is the particular company, and we have relayed a number of concerns about their business practices, though the Export-Import Bank has access to the information that we've given to them.
Q: Has that decision been made?
MR. LOCKHART: No, that decision has not been made.
Q: Joe, going back to --
MR. LOCKHART: Yes? Sorry, let's just finish on this.
Q: Just to clarify, -- in other words, she sent a letter requesting a delay of the Chafee amendment has not been invoked?
MR. LOCKHART: I don't think she - I'm not aware that she sent a letter requesting a delay. I know she's made the case that at this point there is information that we believe should warrant concern about going forward with this loan. But the Export-Import Bank's board is meeting, I think as we speak. And when they come out, they'll presumably have some announcement of how they're going to move forward.
Q: And one other question. If the Chafee amendment is invoked, is that a final decision? Or is that simply an advisory decision to Ex-Im? And could they still go ahead with the loan guarantee --
MR. LOCKHART: My understanding of the law is, Export-Import Bank could move forward despite a Chafee amendment invocation?
Q: Yes, sounds good.
Q: Joe, back on millennium terrorism possibilities - we're talking about all these international possibilities and probabilities. What about domestically? I mean, you're standing there saying the people here should just be careful, be on the lookout. But there are a lot of people who are saying they want to stay inside because of the holiday, because of the possible - you know, terrorism threats and things of that nature. Will there be any stronger statements from the White House or from the State Department about domestically --
MR. LOCKHART: I think people in the government have spoken to that, and we are committed to providing accurate, real-time information to people to address their concerns. In this particular case, we don't have a specific threat against particular targets, so there's nothing I can report. But I think given that we go into the end of this year, we believe that people should be cautious. And in other circumstances, if they see something that might be suspicious, we're telling people to report it, and take the effort to, if you see something suspicious, report it. But again, there's nothing more specific I can report.
Q: Joe, a follow-up. You're saying people should be cautious. Do you think it's overly cautious just to stay inside? Because many people are scared, as Helen said earlier in this conference, that people are actually scared.
MR. LOCKHART: Well, again, we are not advising people to change their plans and not follow through on what they planned to do for their millennium celebrations, whatever that might be. I think - we did think that it was worthwhile to raise these issues. There is a number of things in the news about the arrests and also the worldwide travel advisory, that it warranted to recommend that people exercise caution.
Q: Joe, to clarify, going back to this oil company situation. If the Ex-Im Bank decided to go forward with the loan and you invoked the Chafee amendment, would that halt the loan guarantees from being exercised?
MR. LOCKHART: My understanding is, the Export-Import Bank can move forward if they choose to, despite the Chafee amendment.
Q: I mean, what good is the Chafee amendment? Is that something of a recommendation of sorts?
MR. LOCKHART: Listen, this is the law that Congress passed. It's the ability for the Executive Branch to weigh in the process.
Q: You insist it's more of a situation that you're making a recommendation, in essence, to the Ex-Im Bank or making a request; they don't have to follow that request through?
MR. LOCKHART: That is my understanding of the law.
Q: On the millennium, the public awareness is one side of the equation, deterrence is the other. Usama bin Laden is known to be planning attacks against the United States, he's supported by the Taliban government. Would the President pledge to retaliate against the Taliban government, or has he made that clear if there's an attack linked to bin Laden?
MR. LOCKHART: I think I reported to you all last week that the counterterrorism chief at the State Department met with the Taliban and made it very clear to them that we would hold the Taliban responsible for any steps Usama bin Laden took against Americans abroad.
Q: Joe, what is the administration's knowledge regarding the Algerians in Canada, what their purpose was, the overall group, whether or not it has ties to Usama bin Laden? Can you give us any sense of what your understanding -
MR. LOCKHART: I think that we're looking at, as we said yesterday, associations, potential associations. I don't think we have a clear view at this point on the exact situation, but the investigation continues.
Q: Joe, Senator Inhofe says he's going to block nominations because he's upset that he thinks you broke an agreement with him over recess appointments. Is he right about that, and how do you -
MR. LOCKHART: No, as you know, as we, unfortunately, have to report on a fairly regular basis from here, the Senator is wrong. We made an agreement with Senator Lott, we consulted with Senator Lott on the nominee in question, and it's really unfortunate, given what the Supreme Court Chief Justice Rehnquist has said about the backlog in our courts and the need to move forward judicial nominees, that you have a Senator, once again, starting a legislative session with more threats about how they can block appointees when I think most Americans know our judicial system needs progress rather than partisanship.
Q: Joe, what can you say about the negotiations with the Cuban prisoners who have now been returned to Cuba, and the agreement with Cuba for their return?
MR. LOCKHART: Not much beyond what I think the State Department said over the weekend. It's obviously been a concern of ours that prisoners like this be accepted back in Cuba and I think it was important in this case that the Cuban government allowed them to return back as a way to break the stalemate.
Q: But how do you square our reluctance to negotiate with terrorists and our obvious negotiations with these people and with Cuba to let them leave the prison system and go back to Cuba?
MR. LOCKHART: The policy here, the problem here is that Cuba won't accept them. These are prisoners who have no right to be here and should be returned to Cuba, and Cuba has said they wouldn't take them. And in this case they've agreed to accept them back, which is the proper decision for them and the proper place for them to be.
Q: But there are some 800 others in pretty much the same predicament, aren't there? Doesn't this action encourage others to do what these guys -
MR. LOCKHART: No, I think hopefully this action will encourage Cuba to fulfill their responsibilities to receive those who are not wanted here in this country and should be back in Cuba.
Q: Joe, on another double standard issue, the White House is reportedly recommending to people attending the millennium celebration that they wear silk underwear, that also women wear trousers instead of dresses. That recommendation went out to White House guests. Is there any broader recommendations for others coming to the millennium celebration?
MR. LOCKHART: My recommendations for most reporters is to wear shorts and no shirts so you can be as cold as possible. (Laughter.)
Q: Joe, can you give us a quick readout on the Nazerbayev meeting?
MR. LOCKHART: The President met with President Nazerbayev for about 45 minutes this morning. This was really a follow-on to the meetings that he had with the Vice President. They discussed some security issues, some of the political developments and also some energy issues.
Q: Anything on arms?
MR. LOCKHART: No, not that was specifically reported to me. I can go back and check on that, though.
Q: Joe, do you know if they talked about this Island in the Aral Sea that's a biological toxic zone?
MR. LOCKHART: Let me check on that. That was not reported to me.
Q: What's he doing for the rest of the day?
MR. LOCKHART: For the rest of the day - I did not bring his schedule out, but I'm certain that he has - he was doing his HMX Christmas photos and his military office departure photos as I came down here. There are about 60 of them leaving at the end of the year and it's a Christmas tradition that he -
Q: How did he like shopping on-line?
MR. LOCKHART: He enjoyed it immensely.
Q: Does he know how to do it?
MR. LOCKHART: No. In fact, he had to be extricated from the computer because he had an event and some people were waiting.
Q: What did he get you?
MR. LOCKHART: It's a secret.
Q: No, it's not - it's on the wires.
MR. LOCKHART: Hope so. I mean, what we put out to you guys is one thing, but what he got for me is a secret.
Q: There was a new number today on the death toll in Venezuela. Do you have any update on the U.S. relief efforts?
MR. LOCKHART: Yes, let me look at that. I think as I reported yesterday, General Wilhelm was in Caracas yesterday and has left a team of experts behind to deal with what is an escalating tragedy in Venezuela. We currently have eight helicopters deployed in Venezuela to fly rescue and relief missions. Two more are on the way. We have six C-130s staged out of Puerto Rico, and are flying missions into and out of Venezuela. DOD now currently has about $2.5 million set aside for these efforts.
USAID's Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance has committed initially $3 million for relief supplies and other emergency assistance, that includes things like blankets, shelter material, water containers and other relief supplies. There has already been two charter flights bringing them in and there's more, I think, on the way; as well as the embassy providing funds locally for things to be purchased there. We're going to continue to work with the Venezuelan government to assess their needs and how we can most appropriately help.
Q: The Washington Post story today said that the President was on a timetable of March or earlier in the year for naming a new Fed chairman. Is that accurate?
MR. LOCKHART: I don't know of any timetable beyond the natural expiration of Mr. Greenspan's term. I can only say that the President believes he has done a good job, has a lot of respect for the job he has done and likes him personally. And when we're ready to announce a decision, we'll announce a decision.

Bill Clinton,"December 31, 1999",Statement on the Resignation of President Boris Yeltsin of Russia,"Today President Yeltsin ends his historic tenure as Russia's first democratically elected President.
Under his leadership, since 1991, the Russian people have faced the unprecedented challenge of creating new institutions and building a new life after decades of corrosive Communist rule. His lasting achievement has been dismantling that Communist system and building new political institutions under democratically elected leaders within a constitutional framework. The fact that Prime Minister Putin assumes responsibility today as Acting President in accordance with the constitution is but the latest example of this achievement.
The relationship between the United States and Russia under President Yeltsin has produced genuine progress for both our people. Five thousand strategic nuclear weapons have been dismantled, and our nuclear weapons no longer are targeted at each other. We have worked together to eliminate nuclear weapons from the other states of the former Soviet Union. Russia has withdrawn its troops from the Baltic nations. Now its troops are serving alongside Americans to maintain the peace in the Balkans, and Russia was instrumental in achieving peace in Kosovo. We have also had our differences, such as on Chechnya. But President Yeltsin and my starting point has always been how Russia and America can work together to advance our common interests. In this spirit, I look forward to working with Acting President Putin as the Russian people begin the process of making the transition from one democratically elected President to another.
To President Yeltsin, let me convey my appreciation for the work we have done together. Hillary and I extend our warmest wishes to you and your family.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-the-resignation-president-boris-yeltsin-russia
Bill Clinton,"January 03, 2000",Press Briefing by Joe Lockhart,"Butcher Athletic Center
Shepherd College
Shepherdstown, West Virginia
5:18 P.M. EST
MR. LOCKHART: Thanks all for waiting. Sorry I'm late. The meetings ran a little bit late. Let me give you a quick rundown of what I know, which is not a lot, and then I'll be glad to take your questions.
The meetings kicked off early this afternoon after the pool watched the three leaders go into the National Conservation Training Center. They were held in the Commons Building. The President met first for about an hour with Prime Minister Barak downstairs in the Commons Building. Again, after about an hour, he went upstairs, met with Foreign Minister al-Shara, again for about an hour.
I think as far as trying to give you some sense of the meetings, the President went into the meetings determined to take advantage of the historic opportunity that these talks present to us to reach peace between Israel and Syria, and believes that these talks here in Shepherdstown are an important next step, building on the process that began just before Christmas.
The President wanted to use and did use these bilateral meetings to help formulate plans for the week to work on how to work through the many items on the large agenda that face both sides on how to begin these discussions. Based on the meetings, the President said that he believes the talks are off to a good start. The President believes that both sides are here to work seriously and constructively.
I expect after another hour, hour and a half or so of down time that the parties will come back together tonight and meet in a trilateral. We'll find some way between Assistant Secretary Rubin and myself to give you a readout of that, either here or to the President's travel pool, or both. But we'll let you know sometime in the next couple of hours.
Q: How much time -- and specifically in days -- is the President prepared to invest in this undertaking?
MR. LOCKHART: I think the President is prepared to invest as many days as appropriate, as many days as will be constructive. The parties are working through how they'll move forward now, so I can't give you a sense of how exactly he will interject himself in the process. But he stands ready. I think the schedule for this week is mostly clear. The schedule is light as we move forward into the next couple weeks. And where we'll need to make changes, wherever these talks go, the President will make them in order to play a constructive role here.
Q: In light of your talks with the Syrian and Israeli delegation, do you think that some progress could be made during this session? And do you think that the problems existing could block such things during this time? Thank you.
MR. LOCKHART: Do I think the problems could block progress?
Q: Yes.
MR. LOCKHART: Well, I think there are certainly difficult issues on the agenda that face both parties. And as with any of these talks, if it was easy it would have been done a long time ago. I don't want to raise specific expectations on any particular meeting, particularly on the first day. But I think the process here is to work through the items, to find a way to narrow differences, and work ultimately toward an agreement. I think it's quite unrealistically optimistic to think that that could be done in this round. But it's important to start the work and start the hard work of narrowing differences in order to ultimately reach an agreement.
Q: When Mr. Barak spoke with Mr. Clinton, was security one of the priorities, if not the main issue, on the agenda? And can you tell us anything specific about what Mr. Barak's concerns are?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, I think he has articulated his concerns -- both sides have articulated their concerns publicly. We certainly know what the concerns of both sides are. Certainly, security is an issue, the timing and nature of the peace orders, water -- these are all issues that are well-known.
I don't think, at this point, it's constructive to try to get into the substance of any of those, beyond saying that these issues are difficult, they need to be worked through, and we are aware of the concerns that both sides bring.
Q: On the issue of security, has anybody floated the idea yet of using U.S. troops in either a peacekeeping or observer's role?
MR. LOCKHART: Not that I'm aware of.
Q: Has the President spoken with President Assad in the last week or so? If so, can you tell us anything about their conversation?
MR. LOCKHART: I am not aware that he has spoken to him in the last week. I know he has spoken to him from time to time leading up to the talks that you all followed in Washington, at Blair House. But I just don't know, recently.
Q: Would it be realistic to expect an announcement on a resumption of talks between Israel and Lebanon as one of the products of this round?
MR. LOCKHART: Again, I think that it wouldn't serve a constructive purpose to handicap or speculate on what might happen or what might not happen, other than saying that we expect all the issues that both parties have brought here to discuss to be discussed.
Q: Joe, can you give us any indication what's happening in the Lebanese track? The Lebanese track? Are there any plans for them to join these talks, or the further talks in the future?
MR. LOCKHART: I think the last answer answers it the best way I can.
Q: Can you give us any insights into the atmospherics today between the President and the two leaders? And also, I know that in Wye the informal parts of the talks were an important component of the overall process. Can you tell us to what extent you expect that to be present here?
MR. LOCKHART: I think there's certainly some history, particularly when you look at Wye, on the informal atmosphere playing a constructive role in the discussions. I think there will be ample time for that. I think today was -- this afternoon's talks were more formal, as a way of trying to kick off these discussions and do it in a productive way.
I think the President came out of his two meetings believing, as I said, that they were off to a good start, and that both sides are serious about being here and looking forward to working in that serious way and that constructive way through all the issues they have to work through.
Q: You said that the President helped formulate plans for the rest of the week. Can you give us some sense of these from a mechanics point of view of what the plans are for the rest of the week?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, I don't mean plans as in a meeting schedule; I think more in a broader sense of the issues that they need to work through. And they did some discussion of how they would do that. And I think -- at least it has not been reported to me that there is any decision or any structure to that now, so I think we'll just have to wait and see on that.
Q: A follow-on to that. Can you tell us on what basis the decision will be made whether the President would either stay overnight here tonight or come back tomorrow, or --
MR. LOCKHART: I think the basis is on what we believe would be constructive and helpful to the discussions. I think I would view it as highly unlikely that he'll stay tonight. I expect him to go back after the meetings; they should start a few hours from now.
As far as when he comes back, that's a decision we'll make on a day-to-day basis, and I would caution you to read too much into the President returning here tomorrow or not returning here tomorrow. There's a lot of work that has to be done. Ultimately, the work has to be done between the parties and the President can play a constructive role, as we've seen in the past. And there's also a number of other people on the team here, led by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and the many fine people she has. So I think our presence will certainly be felt here throughout the week, and we'll make a decision on a day-by-day basis on whether the President should be here.
Q: This is a follow-up to that question. The meeting tonight, is that a dinner meeting and is it going to be a small group, is it going to --
MR. LOCKHART: As I was leaving they were still discussing how that would all come together. So we'll try to get you some more, once the meeting -- either once the meeting starts or once it ends.
Q: -- all three leaders?
MR. LOCKHART: I know the President was just taking some time down. He was, when he left, spoke briefly with the members of our team, was going to take an hour or so off and then get back together with the team before proceeding with the rest of the evening.
Q: When will --
MR. LOCKHART: I don't know.
Q: One dignitary not here is President Assad. Does the President feel any need -- first of all, you have an imbalance. You have the Prime Minister of Israel meeting with the Foreign Minister of Syria, who I'm sure reflects rather dutifully the views of the President. Does the President -- our President -- feel any need at this point to be in touch directly with the President of Syria? Could it be that they will meet if this round doesn't do it, is our President prepared to travel some distance to meet with the President, as he has in the past?
MR. LOCKHART: Let me say that we, I think as your question noted, believe that the Foreign Minister does have all the necessary negotiating authority to work here this week. I think the President, as he has in the past, will communicate with President Assad as he views it appropriate and constructive. As far as the President traveling, we've always said we want to play a constructive role here, but I think it's premature to discuss any future travel on the first day of the second round of these talks.
Q: Despite this opening of peace talks last month in Washington, Hezbollah continues to mount attacks -- suicide bombing a couple of days ago, many people injured, a few dead. Is the United States disappointed with Syria's refusal or inability to control Hezbollah?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, I think as we've said many times, we believe it is in all sides' interests to maintain maximum calm with regards to South Lebanon. The Syrians have assured us that they are doing what they can to control the situation. We believe that they're making an effort on that front, but that's something that obviously must continue.
Q: From the two rounds of talks the President held with Barak and the Foreign Minister al-Shara, is it clear now about the American participation? Are they going to be present in these talks at every meeting, or is it they are going to play it day by day and by ear?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, it is certainly clear that the President won't be present at all meetings. Whether other U.S. representatives will be, I think that's something we'll just have to watch as the week goes by.
Q: Off topic here, Joe -- has the President had an opportunity to talk with President-designate Putin yet?
MR. LOCKHART: The President talked to Acting President Putin on Saturday, I believe. They had about a 10-minute conversation. It was Saturday -- I'm trying to remember this -- I think it was just after the radio address. The President congratulated him on his designation as Acting President, told him it was important to continue to work to strengthen the relationship, noted that there are areas of disagreement in the relationship, particularly Chechnya, but there are also many areas that we do agree on.
I think that the spirit was reflected and reciprocated by Acting President Putin, who made a strong commitment to moving forward on the democratic movement in Russia, noted that there were differences, but said that on the core issues that we work on that there is agreement.
Q: If I could just ask a follow-up on that -- does the President see the next three months and how Putin handles himself in the run-up to the presidential elections as crucial to what the future nature of the U.S.-Russian relationship will be?
MR. LOCKHART: I mean, certainly this is an important time, as they move toward elections. But the Russian people will have to speak. And it's our view that we have articulated many times that we support the process of the ongoing democratization in Russia, the movement to market economy, to an open society. And obviously, as they go through a presidential election is a crucial time for the Russian people.
Q: Back to the Syrian-Israeli talks. If possible, if you can give us any indication to the willing of the Syrians to make some humanitarian steps, especially concerning the issue of information about Ron Arad and the missing in action in Sidon?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, I'm not going to get into the substance of the discussions, only to say that we expect that all issues will be on the table and both sides will address the concerns of the other party.
Q: You haven't heard any theory on willingness to give more than they gave before? Because it was one of the Israeli requests in the last round in Washington.
MR. LOCKHART: I'm not suggesting it's not a good question, I'm just not going to give you a good answer.
Q: -- for the day?
MR. LOCKHART: No, I don't think so. I think the President wanted to concentrate on getting these talks off to a good start and didn't see a real utility in having a back-and-forth on it. I think there's important work that needs to get done here.
I think those of you who suffered through Wye will at least remember, if not understand, our belief, and I think the parties' belief here, that what gets done here can be done more constructively without the daily back-and-forth discussing the substance and doing commentary on every hour and every issue. We have some history that suggests to us that it's the right way to go, and that's how we're going to go this week.
Q: Joe, it seems the Y2K situation went pretty well, pretty smoothly over the weekend. However, it does appear that at the FAA and also at the Pentagon there was either a lack of candor on certain issues, or that there was a slowness in getting out some information about breakdowns. Have you talked to any of those folks about --
MR. LOCKHART: I have not. I never even saw anything on the FAA. I saw the story in Saturday's paper on -- or Sunday's paper -- on the Pentagon. I can just tell you that there were a lot of people working very hard to get a lot of important information out. I think the Y2K success story to date is very much a testament to the government working in partnership with local governments, communities, corporations. I don't think there were -- there were very few pockets of people in this country who were not aware and prepared for the Y2K.
And I also know from the position that I take every day of standing here trying to give you real-time information that sometimes the information doesn't come as quickly as we might like. So I have no reason to believe there was any intent to mislead. And I certainly have volumes of evidence about -- that indicates that those who were involved in Y2K did a very good job of communicating on a timely basis real-time information to the American public.
Q: Do you have any time frame for these -- I mean, the length of these talks, how long we can expect, noting that on the 7th or 8th there will be the end of Ramadan?
MR. LOCKHART: Correct. I think that the parties are committed to working through this week and, as we move to the weekend, taking stock of where they are and formulating where they'll go next. I don't have any way of predicting what decision they'll make as far as how they proceed -- whether there is a break or not a break, or whether they go straight through -- only to say that I expect that we'll be back here for three or four days running and then we'll get a sense of how the next phase may play out.
Q: -- Wye Agreement back in 1998, organized and orchestrated by President Clinton, the Israeli government fell down and new elections took place in Israel, as the direct result of this agreement. Do you take into consideration that if an Israeli referendum will reject an agreement now if it will be reached, because Israelis do not believe that it will bring peace, then how do you react? What's your scenario?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, I think that we're on the first day of the second round of talks and you're asking me to formulate a strategy for failure. And we're concentrating on a strategy of success.
Q: Joe, can you say something about the personal role of the President -- not simply the power of the presidency -- in pushing this thing forward? Obviously, with regard to Prime Minister Barak, there is a certain personal confidence in the President's commitment to Mideast peace. But it's unclear, say, the reaction of Foreign Minister al-Shara or President Assad. Is there this personal rapport, which you feel creates confidence in pushing this thing forward from their point of view?
MR. LOCKHART: Yes, I think we're at a unique time in this process, where both sides -- and in fact, if you look on the comprehensive view of the Middle East peace process, the Palestinians included -- have confidence in the President, have a high level of trust in the President, built over, now, seven years of working on this process.
I know that Prime Minister Barak has talked about this. The President has now met with him many times, talked with him countless times. The President has spoken to President Assad countless times in anticipation of the meetings that were kicked off today. So I think one area that drives this process is the level of trust that exists between the parties and the President.
Q: One party that's essential to this process is not here today, which is the Congress. Has there been any discussion within the administration of how you're going to handle that issue? Are they an important player in this process? And where do they come into it, if someone has to go to them and say, we need you to take part by --
MR. LOCKHART: I think they're an important element in the process. I think if you look at the history of peace agreements, you find that there is often an economic role that the United States can play. I think there already have been some discussions with members of Congress about this. We're not at a point where you can do true consultations because we haven't formulated -- and the parties, I don't believe, have firmly formulated -- their ideas and the things that they would be looking for. But I think Congress will play an important role here, and we have committed to the leaders of Congress to fully consult with them on this, and to keep them informed as the process goes.
Thanks everybody.

Bill Clinton,"January 14, 2000",Press Briefing by Joe Lockhart,"The Briefing Room
12:15 P.M. EST
MR. LOCKHART: Good afternoon. Let's go right to the week ahead. I have no announcements. Questions? For anybody who missed this morning's gaggle, the President will be back at 2:20 p.m. in the Roosevelt Room. He will make an announcement on an advance in safety for America's air travelers, with an agreement between the airline industry, the unions that work in the airline industry, and the FAA, to more accurately report in a timely way safety concerns and safety violations to help build a better record, all of this in response to the Vice President's commission that looked at air safety and set goals for this country, going into this new century.
He will also, at the top of that announcement, remark on the news that was in this morning's paper that the pharmaceutical industry now would no longer spend enormous amounts of money in opposing the President's proposal on prescription drugs within the Medicare program, and would drop that opposition and, hopefully, work with us to enact a program that the public overwhelmingly believes is long overdue and is needed as a real and affordable benefit within the Medicare program.
Q: Joe, on the FAA, would you describe that as a whistle-blower agreement?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, obviously, it depends on how you define that. But I think there's an element of that in it. I think it will allow people who know of safety problems to come forward without risk to themselves if they do it in a timely way and within the system -- without risk to themselves. And I think obviously builds a much broader knowledge base as far as safety concerns.
I think there are some European airlines that have done this. I think American Airlines has done a pilot program here in the United States that's been very successful. And we think working together in this way will provide a much-needed and increased sense of a lot of safety issues. It's sort of -- in very short terms, you don't need to wait for a serious accident to understand safety concerns, you can do things in a preventative way.
Q: Who would they report to?
MR. LOCKHART: The system will be within their own companies, working in conjunction with the unions and the FAA.
Q: Joe, what is the political significance --
MR. LOCKHART: Who has a tape recorder on? It's slightly annoying to hear it back as I speak. I'm not that interesting to hear twice. Okay. Thank you.
Q: What is the political significance of the drug companies change of heart? How will it affect the dynamic of the legislative process this year?
MR. LOCKHART: I think you all remember if you watched last year, there was a very aggressive and costly campaign run against the President's proposal that grossly distorted the facts and sought to generate opposition to the President's program, not on the facts, because the facts tell too good a story, but on playing on people's worst fears. I think with the change -- with where the country is, with the change of mind of the drug companies, with the President aggressively pushing this proposal, it raises the very real possibility that in this legislative session, we can provide a modern Medicare program with a real prescription drug benefit.
Q: Joe, are you concerned that they're just trying to take the heat off as we head into the State of the Union here and might go back to their old ways after the 27th?
MR. LOCKHART: If that's their strategy, doing it in a way like this, in a very public way, I think that would go beyond cynicism, and I don't think any group that did that would be seen as a valid voice in any public policy debate. I think they've made clear what their intentions are. We want to see and talk to them and find out exactly what they can do to promote the President's proposal, but I think even in a town as cynical as this, it would be hard to imagine that an organization like this, that would be their motives.
Q: Do you foresee the need for any sort of price controls as you implement a prescription drug benefit?
MR. LOCKHART: I think the President's proposal that he put forward last year, and he'll talk about more this year, is the right way to go, and that's our proposal.
Q: I'm sorry, I'm left in the dark with that answer. Was there a price control proposal last year?
MR. LOCKHART: No, there wasn't.
Q: Okay, so there will be no price control proposal this year?
MR. LOCKHART: I'm not going to get into the specifics of this year's proposal because there's a time and place for that. But the President put forward a plan last year, and I think you can look at that as some sort of guide of what we'll go for this year. There are a lot of people who called it things that it wasn't and put a lot of money behind it, but that doesn't mean you spent $10 million calling it something that it is that something. And I think he has a solid proposal that the public supports, and it now appears that the drug industry supports.
Q: The representative of the drug industry -- I think the chairman -- are speaking for the drug industry. Have they have a meeting with White House officials in the last month or two getting ideas?
MR. LOCKHART: We have been exchanging ideas non-stop with the drug industry. We meet with them on a fairly regular basis. It is an important industry in this country; we want to know what they think and I think they have an interest in knowing what we think. And I think even in the time when they were running these ads, which we were very forceful in denouncing for the liberty they took with the facts and the truth, we kept the lines of communication open.
Q: Is there a change of venue for the Mideast talks from Shepherdstown? There's some sort of doubt that they're going to be held there?
MR. LOCKHART: I know that they will start next Wednesday, and I expect by the end of the day the State Department to make an announcement on where.
Q: Is there a problem?
Q: Will the President be there at the beginning?
Q: Is there a problem?
MR. LOCKHART: There is not a final decision on some of the logistics, and as soon as they're ready they'll put an announcement out.
Q: Will the President be there on the first day? I know he's due to head to the West Coast.
MR. LOCKHART: Yes, I expect the President to attend these talks in a way that will probably approximate the last weeks. We'll go when we think it's useful, when we think we can help the parties work through issues, and that's a decision that will be made on a day-by-day basis.
Q: If we can just come back to the prescription drugs, the drug companies have made it very clear that they would like to have this administered through a third party, which would compete for Medicare beneficiaries, not negotiate with the federal government. Does that jibe* with what you've been thinking about or is that somewhat at odds?
MR. LOCKHART: I don't know enough about what their position is. I know that we have put forward a proposal on prescription drugs that is in conjunction with some reforms to make the Medicare system more competitive. So we'll be -- I'll be interested, and I think those who are working on the policy here will be interested in hearing their ideas, and certainly much more useful in an environment where we're having civil discussions rather than trading charges, to understand their viewpoint.
Q: Is that something the President would support? It sounds very much like the current Medigap program, only an expanded version.
MR. LOCKHART: I don't know that that was in the President's proposal, so I don't know that it would be something we can support, but we're certainly willing to listen to the concerns and issues they want to bring to us.
Q: Joe, why is it not payola when the government provides television networks millions in remuneration for reviewing the scripts of some of their programs for antidrug messages, and then it's not announced at any point during the program that the government is not identified as an advertiser which, in effect, it could be considered --
MR. LOCKHART: I'm not sure I even know what the definition of payola is or how it applies here, but let me just tell you what I know about the program. First off, this program that General McCaffrey and the Office of National Drug Policy engaged in is something that's been public. He discussed this at a congressional hearing last year.
Secondly, you all know that there was legislation passed that provides for a government paid-for antidrug messages on the television networks, on radio networks, in newspapers, at a preferred rate. Thirdly, there was an arrangement reached between the people who do the drug policy ads on the networks to work through alternative ways to get the message out. This is something that we believe is worthwhile to try to find innovative ways to get the message particularly to young people about the dangers of drugs.
This is something, obviously -- the network people wanted to do it because they participated in this and it was done in a way that did nothing to impinge on the creative process that provides us with the primetime shows that I think have been mentioned in relation to this.
Q: But, Joe, if I could follow that, there was no acknowledgement of the government's involvement, the government's review of scripts in any of the television show.
MR. LOCKHART: Well, Wendell, if this is a serious issue I'd say you put it to your bosses and everybody else's bosses here understand that.
Q: You don't think it's deceptive?
MR. LOCKHART: I don't. I don't think -- I think there is a real benefit to getting the message out. There was no sense here of the government playing a role of what you can say and what you can't say. It was a sense of partnership between the government that wants to get an antidrug message out and I think some businesses that think it's in their interest to get an antidrug message out. And as far as sort of theological questions for the entertainment industry, I suggest you put the questions to the entertainment industry.
Q: Joe, is the White House interested in a similar approach on other matters that the President has put before Hollywood executives, like gun violence or other inappropriate --
MR. LOCKHART: Well, we're interested in working, and we have worked very closely with entertainment officials. This is a particular situation because we do have this pot of appropriated money that goes to antidrug advertisement that Congress and the President have decided is a worthwhile use of taxpayers money.
This particular program I think is the result of looking for other ways to get the message out that allows networks in a robust advertising environment to sell to other people where they can make more money.
Q: Is there any studies that can be cited --
Q: If I could follow, is that yes, is that no, or --
MR. LOCKHART: I think I said that we work with people on a wide variety of issues, but on this particular instance, I don't know of any other program where we're doing issues, but on this particular instance, I don't know of any other program where we're doing this kind of thing as far as buying advertisements with the networks and working closely with them on any other issue.
Q: Is that --
MR. LOCKHART: I'm trying to be clear here. We work with industries on, whether it be teenage violence, we work -- we do things like PSAs. We work with them to encourage them to work with us in a partnership. There's no other issue that I know of where we have a relationship like we have when we're actually buying advertising time like we do on drug policy.
Q: Would you want to do that in the future?
Q: When you buy it, it's labeled.
MR. LOCKHART: I don't know. I mean, I think we want to -- there are important ways and innovative ways to get messages out, but I don't know that that's even been considered.
Q: Joe, even though you may be doing the Lord's work in this and everybody wants to reduce drug use by young people, can you see the precedent that's being set here whereby the government reviews scripts and there is --
MR. LOCKHART: John --
Q: Let me finish -- and there is a financial incentive for the networks to come up with scripts that the government approves, even though it may be for a good cause, and therefore, should it, at the very least -- the church-state thing here, as you can see -- at the very least, should there be some kind of disclaimer at the end of these programs saying something like ""this has been approved by the"" --
MR. LOCKHART: Based on, what I think you're asking in the question, it would probably be just as wrong for us to dictate what kind of disclaimer is going to be on. These are all legitimate questions. I understand the basis of them, but I think you're asking in the wrong place. I think you should go to -- we believe that this is a proper arrangement; otherwise we wouldn't have gone forward with it. And I think the networks who are involved also believe that. But I don't think I can state my views more clearly here, and I think most of these questions should be asked someplace else.
Q: Let me see if I can ask a question that you can answer here. From your side of the bargain, it's obvious what the networks get out of it, from your side of the bargain, are the messages contained within the programs as effective as they are in a PSA? Do you have anything that backs that up?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, we've got teenage drug use down, I think 13 percent.
Q: Do you have any studies that you can cite --
MR. LOCKHART: I think certainly the basics of understanding communications will tell you that the more ways you can get a message across, the more effective it's going to be. And we have overall information that is positive on teenage drug use. We've certainly got a lot more work to do, but I don't have a study here that tells me that this works any better than anything else.
Q: Joe, Russia has issued a new nuclear doctrine on its first strike that would allow it to use a first strike against -- quote -- ""an armed aggression that seems to threaten the very existence of the Russian Federation."" This is a departure from their previous doctrine which only allowed a first strike in case of an attack by another nuclear power. Presumably, this is something that they could use against Chechnya. Do you have a reaction to this?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, I understand from reports that there has been a new national security doctrine released or issued by the Acting President. It is something that we look forward to getting a chance to review, but have not fully reviewed yet, so I'm going to defer comment on it.
Q: But if it were to --
MR. LOCKHART: That's an ""if"" question, and I'm not going to answer on something so important.
Q: Are you aware that the U.S. congressional delegation led by Senator Daschle will visit India, Pakistan and Nepal? Now, if they are carrying any message from the President for any of the countries, or especially for the -- Pakistan?
MR. LOCKHART: I don't expect that they're carrying a specific message from the President. Our messages we deliver in a much more direct way.
Q: Did the Russian government inform us of this change of policy on first strike?
MR. LOCKHART: I don't know the answer to that.
Q: How are we getting the document? Did we ask for it, or did --
MR. LOCKHART: We get it through the appropriate diplomatic channels --
Q: And did we ask for it?
MR. LOCKHART: We're getting the document. I think they probably have it, but they haven't had a chance to review it.
Q: Joe, can I come back to legal drugs one more time here? Even very well-managed health maintenance organizations, private insurance -- experience prescription drug increases in double-digits every year. So are we getting into a potential situation here where the costs are going to start to run out of control, particularly now if the drug companies feel that they have more access to a market that can now afford their drugs and continuing developing drugs for that market, and some drugs that cost $10, $20, even $30 in administration -- the costs could easily start ratcheting up.
MR. LOCKHART: It could, but I think the overall approach that the President has laid out is one that introduces enough competition within the system that we'll be able to save money and guard against escalating prices.
Q: Can you foresee a situation in which you may have to cap certain costs, not allow certain drugs, maybe have some sort of schedule or demand generics in certain cases?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, at this point, I am not going to speculate on what may happen in some hypothetical situation. The President has a solid proposal on the table. It is getting increasing support, which is why we're talking about it here today. And that's the approach the President thinks we should take.
Q: Joe, on the aviation agreement, do you know what kind of previously unavailable information will now be accessible? New sources of data was one of the --
MR. LOCKHART: I think it's more the accumulation of information, sort of -- kind of what many in the industry might consider a minor safety violation that they don't necessarily want to report because a negative impact to themselves -- that if a lot of people are reporting it, it could provide trends and patterns of information that allow those who are charged with airline safety and maintenance and things like that to see a problem before it becomes a disaster.
Q: Joe, can I try once more on this drug control policy program? Are you suggesting that, in effect, compensating the networks for drug messages contained in entertainment programming, not acknowledged at any point, whether proper or not, is a matter for the networks to defend and that the government has no responsibility in this matter?
MR. LOCKHART: No, I think you've got to look at this, if you want to look at it fairly, in the overall context, rather than in a sentence of compensating for -- you know well what the system is, where there is a fixed amount of money that the government has appropriated for these advertisements and that are budgeted, and we go ahead and put these ads on, I think which have proved effective. But there are other ways in order to get that message out, and this is an innovative idea to reach the same message we're trying to get out, reach the same people in a slightly different way. And it is ultimately about the results that we achieve.
And, again, if there are those in the entertainment community or the network community that have qualms with this arrangement, then this is something that we're certainly open to discussing, but it's ultimately an arrangement that we're comfortable with, and that up until this morning's newspapers, the networks were comfortable with.
Q: Would you be comfortable with the networks saying, this message was inspired by the Drug Office of the White House?
MR. LOCKHART: If the networks want to --
Q: It should be labeled, really. Otherwise --
MR. LOCKHART: Let's try to keep this about questions and answers and not opinions. If that's an idea the networks want to bring to us, our door is open and we'll have a discussion about it.
Q: Well, we wonder why. You know, this is real interference with scripts.
MR. LOCKHART: Well, no, I don't think it is. But I think if you want to satisfy the concerns, you should talk to the people who write the scripts, you should talk to the people who put the shows on the air who --
Q: We're talking to the White House, which --
MR. LOCKHART: And I'm giving you the best answers I can here.
Q: Joe, just to make sure I understood your previous answer about how this applies to other programs, so in terms of guns or youth violence or whatever, you don't have anything similar to this where you're reviewing scripts and then some kind of remuneration?
MR. LOCKHART: Take a step back here and try to -- I'll go through it again. We have a particular program out of the Drug Policy Office here which Congress appropriated money for, which provides for antidrug advertisements with the networks. Now, there is an arrangement there because it's done at a rate that is not at the rate that Pepsi Cola advertises at.
Within this arrangement, they have worked out a way where in some cases rather than going and doing the ads, they get credits for antidrug messages that get through in the programs. And again, I think this is an issue that we're comfortable with. It serves the purpose of getting the message out in a number of different ways the networks, as participants and as part of this program, are comfortable with and I assume the entertainment companies that they work with are comfortable with. But if there are those who are uncomfortable, they should talk about it. We can have a debate, and we'll see where it goes.
Q: Why is it not propaganda, Joe?
MR. LOCKHART: Pardon?
Q: Why is it not propaganda?
MR. LOCKHART: I'm not standing here saying that it's not. It's getting a message across that I think the public -- that the government, Congress, the President agrees is important to get out to the public about the dangers of drugs. Now, you've got to go and define your words when you say that, so define the word for me.
Q: The word is, if not surreptitiously, at least pushing forward an idea without acknowledging that that is your goal, to set forth --
MR. LOCKHART: We have acknowledged our goal. We have acknowledged that our goal, as we've sat with industry executives on a number of subjects, and drugs is certainly one of them where we've said we want the industry to stop glamorizing drug use. We want the industry to send a positive message on the dangers --
Q: Why not leave it up to the industry to decide how they're going to do it?
MR. LOCKHART: We do leave it up to industry, and this is one program here. Listen, let's go on to the next thing because we're not getting anywhere here.
Q: How is it consistent with the White House message of discipline to be proposing breaching the spending caps?
MR. LOCKHART: First off, we haven't proposed anything on that. Our budget will come out in February and we'll have more to say about it then.
Q: So the story is not true?
MR. LOCKHART: We'll have more to say about it then. I think if your specific question is to the spending caps, the spending caps were made a mockery by the Republican majority in 1999 as they blew through them with a combination of pork and emergencies that would have the American public believe that we didn't know that the Census that we've been doing since 1790 was coming up in the year 2000.
I can guarantee you that we will produce a budget for 2001 that's fiscally disciplined, that builds on the fiscal discipline of the last seven years, that's turned this country around from an economy mired in deficits to an economy that's prosperous in an era of surpluses.
Q: Would any future caps have any meaning since these have been reached in fact and then will be probably abandoned?
MR. LOCKHART: The spending caps certainly have no meaning to the Republican majority, but we will stay with a philosophy that preaches fiscal discipline, and our budget will meet that test.
Q: Just to follow up one more, didn't the President propose another $5 billion in spending at the very end of the budget talks last year that had to be offset? Wasn't there about $5 billion in spending --
MR. LOCKHART: There was additional spending that we proposed during the budget negotiations, and every dollar that we proposed spending for, we had an offset for.
Q: Joe, two questions. According to an intelligence report, Chinese influence in the Panama Canal Treaty will be a danger to the U.S. national security, number one. Number two, Dr. Henry Kissinger is supposedly a friend to the President and advisor behind the curtains, but now he's saying that most of the President's policy has failed, the foreign policy.
MR. LOCKHART: Let me take the first one, which is I obviously can't get into a particular piece of intelligence, but I can tell you with no uncertainty and no doubt that the United States does not believe that a Hong Kong company controlling -- running the ports, loading and offloading ships at the Panama Canal poses any threat to the United States or to our national security, and that is an unequivocal statement.
On the second question, I didn't realize that Henry Kissinger was a behind-the-curtains supporter of the administration. He is a voice in foreign policy, one of many. And if he believes that the foreign policy has been a failure, I think we've achieved an awful lot in the Middle East, an awful lot in Northern Ireland, an awful lot in the Balkans as far as promoting peace. We have 5,000 less nuclear weapons than when this President took office, through our work with the Russians. That's a record that is certainly one to be envied, and perhaps that's what's at the root of the comments.
Q: Without getting into any specific levels, does the President think that the concepts of caps, of statutorily imposed limits on spending is a good one?
MR. LOCKHART: I think the President believes that fiscal discipline is important. I think the President believes in tough budget rules that Congress takes seriously is important. But I think if you look back on 1999, you'll find that the Republican majority shredded these caps, disregarded them, found every gimmick in the book to get around them. And we're not particularly interested in having a long debate about gimmicks, we're interested in having a real budget with real tough budget rules that produces the kind of fiscal discipline that's part of the foundation of the economic prosperity we enjoy.
Q: Just to follow that up, what do you mean by tough budget rules?
MR. LOCKHART: I mean rules that don't make a joke out of the process, where people stand up and talk about the Census being something that we couldn't have foreseen, and that is an emergency. That's what I mean.
Q: Back to the FAA for a second, and I know we'll learn more about this later. You earlier said there will be a system for reporting within the companies. How does that -- is there some sort of national clearinghouse as well? Is that envisioned in this agreement? Will the companies all pour the information into a common --
MR. LOCKHART: I think that will be the FAA component of this, where they are able to centralize the information so that if there is a trend or if there is some pattern of either violations or things that happen, that on a national level, not just within one airline, you can spot the problems. I'd go to FAA for the actual -- the mechanics of that, but that's at the root of the potential solution.
Q: Joe, just because the Republicans shredded the budget cap last fall, why did that give you license to say, well, the bar is open, everyone is going to show up on the budget data this year. Why not just say this is an isolated incident, we're going to go back under the caps again.
MR. LOCKHART: What I'm telling you is, the budget is due in February, and we'll talk about where everything shakes out on the budget just before then as we always do. But I do need to make the point when you ask about it that they, with the Republican majority this year, they were not adhered to from day one and openly. I mean, the Senate Majority Leader said very clearly that they were going to bust through the caps because they were meaningless to them.
Q: The reason we keep hammering at it is because we haven't heard a clear statement saying that we're going to abide by the caps in Fiscal Year 2000 --
MR. LOCKHART: And I'm telling you, it's Fiscal Year 2001 budget's due in February and we'll talk about it then.
Q: Joe, how is the President doing with the new chief in Moscow on global issues of peace --
MR. LOCKHART: Well, I mean, the Acting President Putin is someone who the President has met with on a number of occasions, and we obviously have areas where we work very well together, areas of partnership. We have some areas of disagreement, and we look forward to continuing the dialogue that's ongoing as we lead up to however the Russian people decide what their political future is going to be and who is going to be at the helm.
Week ahead?
Q: One more. Does the White House have any particular view on Michael Jordan coming back to Washington? (Laughter.)
MR. LOCKHART: If there was a tax break to propose to ensure that happened I'm sure we'd find it. No, obviously, that's an exciting prospect for the Capitol City to have the preeminent figure in basketball thinking about coming here and working.
I think it also says something, on a more serious note, about the kind of commitment the people like Abe Pollin have made to this city. I mean, I think it's no secret that -- and this is something the President believes very strongly and we've talked about -- there's no secret that he could have taken this team out of downtown and had it been an immediately much more profitable enterprise. But people like Abe Pollin, people like Lew Katz in New Jersey, who have committed to cities and helping to revitalize cities should be applauded for their work. And the prospect of someone of his stature becoming part of that effort I think is exciting for Washington.
Q: One more on the drug issue. The President has been pretty tough on the pharmaceutical companies for the last number of months, if not year. What kind of tone will he adopt now in public statements about this, now that they seem to --
MR. LOCKHART: I think, obviously, you'll see it today. This is an encouraging move, but we'll want to see how strongly they will get behind this. But, obviously, we're in a much better environment when the drug companies recognize where the American public is and are out of the mode of spending a lot of money to try to distort a proposal because they don't think it's in their interest.
Q: Week ahead.
MR. LOCKHART: Week ahead. Saturday, January 15, the President's weekly radio address will be broadcast live at 10:06 a.m. The President's subject will be civil rights, and some of the things we'll be doing on enforcement as we move into the budget season.
As a special note, the President has a special guest, Ms. Charlotte Filmore will be attending the radio address. Charlotte is 100 years old, and made two wishes at the end of last year. One was to meet President Clinton in person to thank him for all the good work he's done, and to make it to the year 2000 so she could say she lived in three centuries. Tomorrow her two wishes will fulfilled.
That's it for Saturday. There's nothing on Sunday. Monday we will continue our tradition of Martin Luther King holiday as a day on, not a day off -- a day the President will participate in the Martin Luther King, Jr. holiday of volunteering community service event at the Boys and Girls Club of Washington. That will be at 10:30 a.m. He'll do some service work and then make some remarks, which will be open.
Q: Painting, whatever?
MR. LOCKHART: Something like that.
On Tuesday, January 18th, the President will travel midday to Boston, Massachusetts, and address a local community group about his anticrime agenda. That's 1:40 p.m. to 2:40 p.m. Later that evening, the President will attend a fundraising dinner for the DNC at a private residence, print reporter coverage; will return that evening.
Wednesday, as I think I mentioned earlier, we anticipate the Middle East talks, Israel and Syria will resume. We'll let you know closer to the date the President's participation in that. He will also that evening have a meeting with the Crown Prince of Bahrain and will attend a fundraising dinner at the Corcoran Gallery of Art for the DNC.
Q: What's the location of the talks?
MR. LOCKHART: Trick question. It's not written down here, I don't know.
Thursday, no public schedule. Friday afternoon the President will travel to Los Angeles, California, to attend a DNC dinner; will overnight in Los Angeles and return to Washington on Saturday afternoon, following a brunch Saturday morning.
Saturday, the President will again do his radio address live at 10:06 a.m. And that's it.
Q: No Chappaqua next week?
MR. LOCKHART: No, not now.
Q: One last question. There was a news story that came up that Holbrooke has warned the Indonesian generals against staging a coup. Why is he doing that?
MR. LOCKHART: Because we believe in democracy and not coups.
Thank you. END 12:53 P.M. EST",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/press-briefing-joe-lockhart-67
Bill Clinton,"January 27, 2000","Press Briefing by Chief of Staff John Podesta, Deputy Chief of Staff Maria Echaveste, National Economic Advisor Gene Sperling, National Domestic Policy Advisor Bruce Reed, and National Security Advisor Sandy Berger on the President's State of the Union Address","The Roosevelt Room
10:13 A.M. EST
MR. PODESTA: Maria Echaveste, who has been running the process to build the State of the Union, putting together the policy consults and to really work with the process of getting the drafts and working with the speech writers and getting the prep done, will be in. Obviously, Gene is here -- Gene Sperling and Bruce Reed are here. And Sandy Berger will join us at the end and talk about the foreign policy sections of the speech.
I think that the President will begin by talking about this great moment of prosperity and great moment of promise for the country. He's going to spend some time talking about the strategy that he and the Vice President brought to town in 1993, a strategy that has had proven results. We'll review that very briefly. He will challenge the Congress to get on with the unfinished business, to pass the patients' bill of rights, to pass the minimum wage, and to deal with critical issues that were left behind from last year's unfinished business.
But he's going to spend the bulk of his time challenging the country to take the long look ahead, to think about the big challenges facing the country, and then lay down a specific program of what we can do this year to go down the path that he will lay out. It will be consistent with his themes that he has talked so much about, of opportunity, responsibility and community. You can expect to hear those words.
Q: I'm sorry, say those words again. (Laughter.)
MR. PODESTA: We're going to -- he'll talk about continuing on the path of fiscal discipline, continuing to pay down the debt. Obviously yesterday -- or a few days ago -- I can't remember any more --
Q: The day before.
MR. PODESTA: -- discuss the fact that our budget will retire the entire federal publicly-held debt by 2013; challenge the Congress to extend the solvency of Medicare to 2050; challenge the Congress to modernize Medicare, to extend its solvency, and to add a much needed prescription drug benefit.
I think that -- there are strong sections on the environment. There is as strong section on science and technology. The President spoke at Cal Tech here last Friday, and I think he will talk about how investments in science and technology can power the economy forward and also do things like come up with new cures for diseases like cancer and diabetes, Alzheimer's and AIDS.
And then I think he'll spend some time this year talking about some new issues that have come up because of the wiring of the global economy and the growth of the Internet, how do we close the digital divide. He'll talk about the challenge to privacy in medical records and financial records, and the new threats that come, the new national security threats, which Sandy will talk a little bit more about later, that are the result of this new interconnected world, and networked world.
But that's kind of the structure of what he will be doing tonight. Maria, if you want to take a second, just talk a little bit about --
MS. ECHAVESTE: Sure, just the process of how we got here. And the first thing is that all those policy ideas, even those that are a sentence long, represents a lot hard work by a lot of people. With Gene and Bruce, and George Frampton at the Council on Environmental Quality, and Neal Lane at the OSTP, Office of Science Technology and Policy.
We did get a little late start this year, because we didn't finish the budget until November. But people had been working, and after the budget was done, put together some policy memos for the President, ideas to get some feedback, see what the President is interested in doing. And then we had a couple meetings with him in which he, as they -- the budget process and the State of the Union process sort of have to dovetail together and work, coordinated.
And then we sent an outline. Terry Edmonds, who, as you know, is our chief speechwriter, and he got his team together to send a draft that, yes, was very, very long. But we wanted to make sure everything was in there. And then we began the very important process of tightening, editing. And he has been working on it. And we keep getting back marked-up copies, and we've had several run-throughs, of which our -- it's not just simply reading the speech, it's thinking through, is this what we want to emphasize? Is this what we want to stress? And so I think we've had several really good sessions. We'll start again this afternoon and be ready for tonight.
The only other thing is, the other thing that -- we're the repository for innumerable requests for, special requests for mentions -- I've got eight pages, single-spaced, of everybody who's said, please have him say this.
MR. PODESTA: We may be making a lot of enemies tonight. (Laughter.)
MS. ECHAVESTE: Yes, exactly, and they all know my name. (Laughter.)
Q: You mean people in the public or people in the government context?
MS. ECHAVESTE: Actually, across the board. It's really quite interesting how many people --
MR. PODESTA: A few members of Congress.
MS. ECHAVESTE: So I'll just stop there and hand it over to Bruce.
MR. REED: As John said, tonight the President will propose an ambition Third Way agenda. And we are confident we can get it done this year. Tonight's speech follows a familiar formula restoring the vital center by promoting opportunity and responsibility. Let me go over some of the major sections of the speech.
First, the President will call for a 21st century revolution in education and lay out a sweeping education plan. He demands more from our schools and invests more in them. And he is proposing an unprecedented increase in education spending, $4.5 billion in new spending, as well as a new $30-billion college opportunity tax cut that he announced last week.
He's also calling for an unprecedented level of accountability. The major education initiatives are, first, doubling funding for after-school to $1 billion, which will allow us to provide after-school and summer school to 2.5 million kids, including every child in every failing school in America. The largest increase in Head Start funding in history, $1 billion. That will take the program from $5.3 billion to $6.3 billion. We've already nearly doubled money for Head Start since we took office in '93. These new investments will build a foundation for our long-term goal of universal pre-school for every child.
He's going to propose doubling funding to turn around failing schools. Last year he called on Congress to pass his fund to turn around failing schools or shut them down. Congress gave us $134 million in the last budget to do that. We're doubling that to $250 million this year.
He has a new proposal to reward states for making progress on standard achievement; a $1-billion teacher quality initiative, including new proposals on higher pay for teachers in return for higher pay for teachers in return for higher standards.
He's going to propose a $450-million increase in class size funding, which will allow us to get halfway to our goal of 100,000 teachers to lower class size in the early grades. He'll talk about his school construction initiative, to provide urgent repairs to 5,000 schools a year, and his tax credit to build or modernize 6,000 schools. He'll talk about charter schools. And again, he'll talk about the steps we've taken to expand access to college, and finally open the doors of four years of college to all.
And we believe we can get this education plan done. We have doubled spending on education and training over the last seven years. Five years ago, Republicans were talking about dismantling the Department of Education. They don't talk that way anymore. Last year, they joined with us in enacting a record education budget, and we think that we'll be able to work together to enact these proposals this year.
The second big part of the speech is on rewarding work and family, with the goal of helping parents succeed at work and at home. He has already proposed a major expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit. In tonight's speech, he'll have a new proposal to make the dependent care tax credit refundable. This helps cover child care costs, and it will enable the typical family of four with $25,000 in income to receive up to $2,400 to pay for child care.
He'll talk about the health care plan that he unveiled earlier this month to expand -- the CHIP program to cover parents, together with CHIP for kids. This new plan will allow us to cover nearly one-quarter of the uninsured in America. He will again call on Congress to join with him to strengthen and modernize Medicare, and make an impassioned plea for affordable prescription drugs for all seniors, and passing it this year.
He'll add a fatherhood agenda, including tough new child support measures, but also helping put fathers who have child support to work to pay it off.
The third big section of the speech is on crime and guns, with the goal of making America the safest big country on Earth; calling on Congress to finish the job of putting 50,000 more police on the street; passing the common-sense gun measure that has been tied up in conference for the past six months. And Tom Mauser (spelling), whose son Daniel was killed in Columbine, will be in the First Lady's box, and so that's a section of the speech to watch out for.
He'll talk about support for smart guns and increased gun prosecutions and some other measures. And then, in a moment Gene will want to talk about the New Markets section of the speech, which is also quite expansive.
John already talked about the environment, science and technology. The speech closes with a section on community, laying out a number of steps to build one America. He's proposes a new tax credit for charities, which Gene can talk about in a minute; calls on Congress to finally pass the hate crimes bill. And elsewhere in the speech, there is a strong plea to Congress to finish the unfinished business of the last century, passing campaign finance reform; passing a real patients' bill of rights; finally raising the minimum wage.
It's a big agenda, but we think we can get it done this year. Four years ago, everybody said we wouldn't be able to get anything done because it was an election year, but we went on to pass Kennedy-Kassebaum, raise the minimum wage, enact welfare reform. And the President will signal tonight that with or without help from Congress, he is determined to use his executive authority and the force of his agenda to get as much done as he can until the day we leave.
MR. SPERLING: Clearly the President will stress that much of what is good in the American economy and much of what is good in our budget estimates and budget surplus emanates from the fiscal discipline the country has exhibited over the last seven, years, and that certainly that has been an integral piece in what will soon be the longest expansion in our country's history.
He will certainly remind people that he stood before Congress two years ago and asked them to maintain their fiscal discipline in saving the surplus, and that because we have done so, and often with the President's veto pen, America has experienced back-to-back surpluses, and that if we stay on that path -- he will challenge Congress to stay on that path so that we can pay off the external national debt entirely by 2013, the first time since 1835.
He will, as he has been, stress that we should get a bipartisan down payment this year on Social Security reform by simply taking what has been an almost uniform commitment now to use the Social Security surpluses for debt reduction, and by simply doing the next logical step, which is ensuring that the interest savings from that debt reduction go not to other spending or tax cut measures, but to this purpose, to protecting Social Security.
He will also stress the importance of us reserving a substantial amount of the surplus and having new reforms, most dramatically prescription drugs, and both extending the solvency of Medicare to 2025 and, as I said, in offering the voluntary universal prescription drug proposal. He will make clear that he is allocating nearly $400 billion of the on-budget surplus for the purpose of extending the solvency of Medicare and for prescription drugs.
And finally, on the fiscal discipline side, he will, as he has in the past, stress that while there are many strong, bold and important initiatives, that all of this must be done in the context of the fiscal discipline and path of debt reduction that has brought us to the point we're at.
As Bruce mentioned, he will make a special effort, as he has so often, to stress that now is the time to make sure we are including all communities in our country in our prosperity. He'll stress his New Markets Initiative, how he's doubled the proposal. He will make clear his appreciation to Speaker Hastert for joining him in Chicago and pledging to work together on bipartisan legislation. And he will mention his new New Markets tour designed to close the digital divide this spring.
He will also make very clear that on open markets, that America must go forward, that we must have a new consensus on open trade; and that he will vigorously seek to achieve passage of China permanent NTR, as well as the CBI and Africa Trade Initiatives.
I have -- we are also putting out today more of our tax cut initiative. And I'll do that briefly, but I could go on as long as the President's State of the Union if I went into all the details. So I'll save some for your questions and I can be available later.
I think the overall context that the President has is that his overall tax cut will be approximately the same size as last year. We feel that there can and should be targeted tax cuts to address needs, savings, health care, education, of rewarding work, but they need to be done in a way that stays on the path of fiscal prudence and paying off the national debt.
He will propose today, as part of that package, a new RSA, retirement savings account. And this builds off what the President called upon in the '92 election, the IDAs, individual development accounts. It's also, in a sense, a form of the USA account. They are all geared at the same basic goal, which is that we do far too little to encourage lower and moderate-income families in our country to save, to accumulate wealth, and save for a first home and a dignified retirement.
Of the nearly $100 billion that we offer in tax expenditures every single year for retirement and savings initiatives, only $2 billion goes to families in the bottom 40 percent of the tax bracket. The families that struggle to go paycheck to paycheck, that need the most incentives to save, get the least incentives in our current system. And this President has made this a priority.
There was a lot of support last year in the USA account, but a lot of feeling that at a more manageable -- that people wanted more diversity in the package. This would be a $70 billion initiative, and what it would essentially do is for lower and moderate income families, when they started a new account at $100, they would be matched up to $1,000 for their contributions. So a family could contribute $1,000 and be matched $1,000. And the first $100 they put in, they would get an extra $100 match as an incentive to start these accounts.
These tax credits would go to the financial institution or the employer, so the match would go to the employer who would provide these funds. A family -- an individual who did this for his full life would accumulate $266,000 in savings if they utilized it to its full extent.
There is also, in an effort to do something about the fact that only 18 percent of people who work for small businesses have employer-provided pensions, we have a 50-percent tax credit for small businesses who provide automatic pensions to their non-highly-compensated employees. Together those two parts cost about $71 billion.
In addition, the President will propose a targeted marriage penalty tax relief. This provision, when phased in, will mean that the standard deduction for a married couple where both parents are working would be double the standard deduction of a single individual deduction. So, in other words, a married couple who both are working would have the same size standard deduction as if they were each working and filing individually.
In addition, in 2005 we would expand for all couples, whether or not they were facing a marriage penalty or not, a $500 increase in the standard deduction. This would cost $45 billion over 10 years and help 42 million families.
As Bruce mentioned, we are also expanding the child care dependent tax credit, expanding and making it refundable. And as Bruce said, what so many people have stressed is that however well-intentioned the dependant child care tax credit is for the families particularly making under $30,000, offering the tax credit when many of them have no tax liability does little to deal with what is an enormous burden and disincentive to work for many families, which is the high cost of child care. By both expanding the child care dependent tax credit and making it refundable, it will be a major piece of the President's overall agenda to take away the barriers to work for families who are trying to get into the middle class.
Finally, as Bruce mentioned, building off the Philanthropy Conference that the First Lady and the President did at the White House, we'll have three provisions that will encourage charitable giving. One that Bruce Reed and the First Lady's Office have worked on would say that for people who don't itemize, that 50 percent of their contributions over $500 they'd get a credit for. So this would allow the majority of Americans who do not itemize to also share the notion of getting deductions for charitable contributions. In addition, we would make things easier for foundations. And the third provision would allow for larger amounts of stock to be donated by individuals without hitting their income cap.
So those are the provisions we're putting out that we have not put out so far.
Q: Gene, how does the stock conversion work for charities?
MR. PODESTA: There's a 30 percent limit right now.
Q: Would you raise that?
MR. SPERLING: We are raising that to 50 percent. And this is something the people in the philanthropy community feel is very important to them, that there are many people who have accumulated significant wealth, stock wealth, but are discouraged from giving because they would come up against the 30 percent cap. Many of the foundations and philanthropy advocates believe this would get them greater access to some of the new wealth that's been created in the last five years.
Q: And that's parity with cash now?
MR. SPERLING: Yes.
Q: Gene, could you tell us -- you've got a $70 billion here, a $45 billion there -- if you add up all these things, all the President's proposals, the different education and tax initiatives, what does it all come up to?
MR. SPERLING: It will be approximately the same as last year, which would be that there would be a net tax cut of in the range of $250 billion. So in other words, it would be --
Q: For 2001?
MR. SPERLING: For the next 10 years.
Q: You said it's a net?
MR. SPERLING: That's net, that's right.
Q: Does that mean that he still has some tax increases in loophole closures?
MR. SPERLING: We have a significant package addressing the unfair use of tax havens, shelters, loopholes that Treasury has worked on, and that will be in this package. When you net that out, the net tax cut, or the amount coming out of the on-budget surplus would be around $250 billion.
Q: And the cost of the new initiatives in education and training and across the board, what would they be?
MR. SPERLING: I would say that -- we'll obviously have all the details out on February 7th, but you will see a gross tax cut in the range of $350 billion, and a net tax cut in a range of $250 billion. But if you're asking how much money are we dedicating from the over-budget surplus to tax cuts, it will be in the range of $250 billion.
Q: Is there a tobacco tax increase in there?
MR. REED: We'll put out the details on the tobacco plan with the budget. Our proposal this year focuses primarily on holding tobacco companies accountable for reducing youth smoking.
Q: A modified look back?
MR. REED: There may be something like that in there.
Q: But there is no 55 cent per pack tax increase?
MR. REED: As I said, we'll put out the details. It will be available February 7th.
MR. PODESTA: I want to add one thing to Gene's -- I don't think anybody mentioned this, but the other three things, since everybody is interested in tax cuts, that we're talking about doing is, a $3,000 long-term care tax cut; a tax cut to help people buy into Medicare. The President has proposed that people 55 to 64 be able to buy into Medicare, and we'll provide a 25-percent tax credit to make that more manageable, and a tax credit who are in COBRA to keep their insurance when they're in between jobs.
MR. SPERLING: Another one that maybe some people might not have noticed was that we also put out something to deal with the relief from the alternative minimum tax. And I know many of you have written that. And the problem that is basically happening is that families with a large number of children, who are taking a large number of deductions, are starting to hit up against an alternative minimum tax that was designed to address wealthy taxpayers and corporations, not families which simply have lots of deductions because they have several children. And so this initiative gradually takes out -- exempts the child dependent exemptions from counting against the alternative minimum tax credit.
Q: Gene, two things. Can you give us a ballpark figure on the tax -- shelter loophole closings? And a few minutes ago, you said that there would be an on-budget surplus for extending the life of Medicare and prescription drugs. Can you give us a breakdown there, in figures?
MR. SPERLING: About three-quarters would address solvency.
Q: Okay, so roughly $100 billion for prescription drugs?
MR. SPERLING: Again, we'll give out all the details. But again, those are net numbers, so they don't -- so you have to remember that there are some offsets in savings. So what we're giving out is, we'll give you a sense of what is the take from the on-budget surplus.
Q: And the loopholes, the shelters --
MR. SPERLING: I think you'll find it in the range of eight to ten a year.
Q: Gene, is there any kind of threshold on the marriage penalty deduction?
MR. SPERLING: Let's see. I don't think so.
Q: So, in essence, you're wiping out the marriage penalty?
MR. SPERLING: I don't think -- people have different descriptions of the marriage penalty. There are about 45 million couples who are affected by the differential treatment for a family versus an individual. Of those, about 25 million get a marriage bonus; they do better. And about 20 million do worse.
The system was essentially set up at a time when there was a single earner. So basically, if you have a single earner, the different rates are a winner for you. The people who actually face a penalty tend to be the reason -- two people working who are making near the same amount of money. And there's about 20 million of them. One of the ways to address that is by making sure that their standard deduction is no worse because they're filing jointly than it would be if they were filing individually.
There's another issue, which is, where the thresholds hit, 15 percent, 28 percent, et cetera. So there are very different variations of what people consider the marriage penalty. We feel ours is a more targeted one, because it tries to address those families that actually are experiencing a marriage penalty , as opposed to some which just go across the board, and actually spend tens of billions giving more to families that are already -- the 25 million who are already getting the marriage bonus.
Q: Gene, I don't quite understand the numbers you're giving on the gross increase in the President's spending proposal. What is the total on the President's spending proposal?
MR. SPERLING: Again, the net tax cut is $250 billion. The gross would be between $80 billion and $100 billion higher than that. But we'll give out all the details when we put out our budget.
Q: And that's for all of his new spending initiatives?
MR. SPERLING: I'm sorry, that's for the tax cut.
Q: I'm talking about the initiatives.
MR. SPERLING: Let me say this. Last year, the President had a gross tax cut of about $322 billion and a net tax cut of $250 billion. This will be in the same range. The gross tax cut will be slightly higher because there are more loophole closures.
Q: We were asking about appropriated funds. The cost of new initiatives and the figure that's out that's been in the press anyway is about $150 billion. Do you have a figure, or is that the figure -- about the new initiatives, the cost of the new initiatives?
MR. SPERLING: I don't know what people are adding up, but you can think of it in the following way. You're taking the entire Social Security surplus and putting that off limits to pay down the debt. Then there's an on-budget surplus which is in the ballpark of what I think most budget experts thought was the realistic CBO estimate that came out. A large chunk of that also goes to additional debt reduction to deal with Medicare. Anything else we're doing kind of new and above would have to fit in the remaining on-budget surplus.
We've described a lot of that so far -- $250-billion, approximately, net tax cut, and you've seen some of our health care initiatives. So I don't think there's any great mystery. I think we've talked about discretionary initiatives, it's a little difficult because sometimes one discretionary count's up and one's down, so it's not necessarily new additional spending.
Q: Give us the gross and then give us the net, after offsets.
MR. SPERLING: On discretionary.
Q: Just tell us how much you're going to spend overall and how many offsets --
MR. SPERLING: I just want to make one thing clear. This is not a budget briefing. We're getting done February 7th. What we're doing is, we've rolled out different levels of our initiatives and we're putting out another chunk of them today, and I think that most of the major initiatives have been put out. I don't think it's hard to figure out what the overall parameters are, because it has to fit within the on-budget surplus.
Q: Let me ask you on Social Security, Gene, how much of the interest savings will be dedicated to shoring up Social Security?
MR. SPERLING: The way that our plan works is that we take the entire Social Security surplus and pay down the debt during this 10-year period. That creates significant dramatic interest savings for the government for years. What we do is say that those interest savings, having been created by debt reduction from the Social Security surplus, should be committed back to Social Security. That would allow us to extend the solvency of Social Security to 2050.
The point that the President has made repeatedly is that Republicans continue to use the phrase Social Security lockbox, which might give somebody the impression that somehow this was actually specifically benefitting Social Security. This may be committing Social Security surplus for debt reduction, but the benefits of that debt reduction remain completely unallocated under Republican initiatives. Not a single penny is committed to extending the life of Social Security by a single day.
When the President talks about a Social Security lockbox, or paying down the debt for Social Security, he's taking the interest savings after 10 years and ensuring that that's extending the solvency of Social Security until at least 2050.
And what the President said is that while we still need to have bipartisan process to go beyond, this is a bipartisan down payment we can do so we can at least extend the life of Social Security to 2050. We have never gotten a good response as to why Republicans would not support this reasonable provision.
Q: John, can you talk about, first of all, what the President will say about the Vice President in the State of the Union, and secondly, is the State of the Union that the President gives this year different in some fundamental way since it's his last year from the ones he's given the previous seven years?
MR. PODESTA: Well, I think that you will hear him talk about the Vice President in much the same way he has in the past seven years. He's been his partner in this from the very beginning. He's led on certain issues. But I think you will see that it will be about the same as you've heard him speak about the Vice President in the past seven years on the critical issues I think he's played a leadership role on. Obviously, the Vice President has been the President's partner on virtually everything, but there are certain key questions where he's up front and has played a leadership role.
With regard to whether this is a different State of the Union, obviously it's the first State of the Union of the new millennium, as well as the President's last State of the Union. And I think that he will try to present to the American public a vision about where the country can go, what the big challenges are, taking, as Teddy Roosevelt said, that long look ahead, and then use that framework to lay down some concrete steps we can take right now, this year, to move down the path of greater prosperity and greater opportunity.
Q: How much closer to the next millennium is this speech going to take us? (Laughter.)
MR. PODESTA: I think his horizons are large, but they're kind of consistent with human thought. No, he'll be talking about the challenges that we face from -- Sandy just came in -- from both the national security perspective and the economic perspective, from the education and health care, over the course of the next four or five years.
Q: One thing on the numbers. I heard at one point that to extend the solvency of Medicare to 2050?
MR. SPERLING: At least 2050, yes. Oh, I'm sorry. Did you say Medicare or Social Security?
MR. PODESTA: Social Security to at least 2050; Medicare to at least 2025.
Q: You mentioned that the President plans to use his executive authority as much as possible to get things done, with or without Congress in the coming year. Can you elaborate on that a little bit?
MR. REED: Sure. Well, in a host of areas over the last seven years, the President has used his executive authority to get things done for the American people with executive orders on privacy, on child support, on welfare reform, on medical errors and so on. We intend to continue doing that, for two reasons -- first, to get things done, to break the logjam in Washington, to not wait for the legislative process; but also our experience has been that every step we take through executive action also helps to build pressure for Congress to take action as well.
Q: Can I just refine my question? Is this an attempt to expand the authority of the presidency itself?
MR. REED: It's an attempt to get things done for the American people.
MR. PODESTA: Let me give you another example. In 1996, when the Congress passed the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill, also an election year, they gave themselves a three-year deadline to put in place comprehensive medical privacy bills. They spent three years, they couldn't get the job done, they were gridlocked by various interests on Capitol Hill. The President made a proposal. That triggered presidential authority under the statute to provide real protection for mental records in this new electronic era. The President seized that authority, proposed regulations, and will finish the job this year and provide real privacy for medical records in this electronic world this year.
MR. BERGER: The second half of the speech is on national security. (Laughter.) What the President will do this evening is set forth the broad challenges that we face in an increasingly globalized world, at a time when we are at the zenith of our power and influence, to promote peace and democracy and a more widely-shared well-being. He'll talk about four or five of those broad challenges. One is to encourage the long-term transition of our former adversaries, Russia and China, into stable, prosperous democratic nations.
We have a great stake in supporting democracy and economic reform in Russia, even as it struggles with the legacy of communism, with a self-defeating war in Chechnya. The President will call for greater efforts with Russia on reducing the nuclear threat, as well as working cooperatively with Russia on threat reduction programs in Russia that will safeguard nuclear weapons and nuclear materials.
As for China, the best thing we can do to counter the government of China's illusion that it can foster stability at the expense of freedom is to bring China into the WTO and expose it to the kinds of forces of change that will occur. And, of course, that would be a big issue for this Congress, hopefully earlier rather than later in the year.
The second challenge is to protect our security from conflicts in a world that threaten our interests and our values. The President's obviously made enormous progress over the years in helping to bring peace to the Middle East and stopping two brutal wars in the Balkans, and advancing the peace process in Northern Ireland this year, and getting talks going on Cyprus.
Next year -- or this year is one of enormous challenge, particularly in trying to achieve a comprehensive Middle East peace and building the institutions of autonomy in Kosovo, and hopefully moving the process forward on Cyprus.
The third challenge the President will talk about is keeping the inexorable march of destructive technology from giving terrorists and hostile nations the means to undermine our defense. That means restraining threats from North Korea, from Iraq and Iran. It means spending more on preparing for biological and chemical threats to the United States. It means spending more and doing more on protecting our cyber-systems from hostile attack.
And finally, the President will speak about the challenge of narrowing the huge gap between rich and poor in the world, which is actually in some respects getting larger -- 1.3 billion people now live on one dollar a day or less. The President will talk about a number of initiatives.
Last year, he joined with Congress to do a very major debt reduction program, with our allies doing the same. We need to move that forward. We need to help countries build their democracies, fight drugs. The President will be submitting a $1.6 billion, two-year program to help Colombia fight the narco-traffickers.
There is in this budget an initiative for helping fight AIDS in the developing world, particularly in Africa, $150 million, and a new initiative the President will announce tonight which will provide tax incentives for private industry to develop vaccines for malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS, that are particularly directed towards poorer countries where there is not the wealth and income to sustain the research on this kind of medical advance.
In general, the President will make a strong plea for leadership, American engagement, bipartisan, in the year ahead in foreign policy.
Q: How much tax break on the vaccination?
MR. BERGER: It will be $1 billion over the decade, which will be essentially a dollar of tax credit for every dollar that is purchased by certified organizations that are distributing this in the developing world, for particularly new vaccines that are developed as a result of this initiative, in those three areas of malaria, TB and HIV/AIDS.
Q: So it's actually -- the tax break goes after the vaccine has been developed to purchase it, as opposed to R&D for the pharmaceutical company?
MR. BERGER: The tax break -- it will be in some ways iterative. The tax credit will create a market for developing new vaccines on malaria, because they will be -- whatever the purchasing power that exists now essentially will be doubled.
Q: How much will that help HIV, because it's much more expensive?
MR. BERGER: Well, it is -- there's a wide range of initiatives in the budget on AIDS and HIV. This is particularly directed towards the problem in the developing world, and particularly, for example, in Africa, where this has become a problem of such magnitude that it is affecting the stability of countries, the ability for them to maintain economic viability. And both the assistance for treatment of AIDS in the Third World, the $150 million this year, and the vaccine program are simply part -- in a sense the international part. I don't know whether Bruce or somebody wants to talk about that.
Q: Sandy or Bruce, is this as much about distributing these drugs in countries that need them and really can't afford to buy them? Or is it really about R&D to come up with new vaccines, new treatments, new medications?
MR. BERGER: It's about the latter -- I mean, it's about both. This credit will only be available for new vaccines that are developed as a result of the initiative. But in assessing whether or not to invest X million dollars in developing a new malaria vaccine, companies will know that there is not only whatever market they think is out there by virtue of the countries themselves, but essentially times two.
Q: Will he announce anything new about how the U.S. approaches Iraq? I mean, we're nine years after the war and Saddam Hussein is still in power. We don't have weapons inspectors on the ground.
MR. BERGER: The four pages I had on Iraq -- (laughter) -- Podesta cut, so we're probably not going to unfold a new Iraq policy. But essentially, our policy remains the same. That is, we're going to continue to contain the threat that Saddam poses to his neighbors, poses to the region, while at the same time working with others to bring about a regime change in Iraq.
Q: What about the ABM or Comprehensive Test Ban treaties?
MR. BERGER: He will mention the development -- we continue to develop a national missile defense system, that he will decide on later this year. At the same time, we negotiate with the Russians in an effort to accommodate the ABM treaty to these changes. He will mention the Comprehensive Test Ban treaty, hoping that we can have, this year, a bipartisan dialogue on the treaty that will create a greater degree of common ground and understanding about what the treaty does and addresses some of the criticisms from last year.
Q: They won't specifically ask for another vote?
MR. BERGER: Not in the State of the Union speech itself, no.
Q: Is he going to talk anymore about the Clinton Doctrine, the notion of intervening in sovereign countries to prevent genocide or other chaos?
MR. BERGER: Well, I wouldn't describe it exactly that way. I mean, what has been called a doctrine is -- I think the President has said that where our interest and our values are threatened -- as they were in Kosovo, as they were in Bosnia, as they were Haiti, as they were in Iraq -- and where we have the capacity to act, particularly with others, we should be prepared to do so. But that doesn't mean that we can -- the United States can intervene everyplace in the world where there are wars or conflicts or turmoil.
Q: Anything new on the Middle East that he might say tonight on the peace talks?
MR. BERGER: I think he will keep very much within the spirit of his admonition that less said and more done.
Q: Is he going to meet with Barak in Davos?
MR. BERGER: I don't believe that Prime Minister Barak will be in Davos. Chairman Arafat will be in Davos and I think we'll meet with Chairman Arafat.
Q: You will see Arafat, Sandy?
MR. BERGER: That's our expectation. People coming and going in Davos --
Q: Anyone else, like the King of Jordan, who will be there, too?
MR. BERGER: I think the plan now is to have -- because the President is not going to be in Davos for a long period of time, and there are a lot of leaders there, and a lot of private sector people of real interest -- will be to have some sort of a larger reception in which the President has an opportunity to talk to a number of people, including certainly the King of Jordan.
MR. PODESTA: All right, thanks.
END 11:08 A.M. EST",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/press-briefing-chief-staff-john-podesta-deputy-chief-staff-maria-echaveste-national
Bill Clinton,"January 27, 2000",Address Before a Joint Session of the Congress on the State of the Union,"Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, honored guests, my fellow Americans:
We are fortunate to be alive at this moment in history. Never before has our Nation enjoyed, at once, so much prosperity and social progress with so little internal crisis and so few external threats. Never before have we had such a blessed opportunity and, therefore, such a profound obligation to build the more perfect Union of our Founders' dreams.
We begin the new century with over 20 million new jobs; the fastest economic growth in more than 30 years; the lowest unemployment rates in 30 years; the lowest poverty rates in 20 years; the lowest African-American and Hispanic unemployment rates on record; the first back-to-back surpluses in 42 years; and next month, America will achieve the longest period of economic growth in our entire history. We have built a new economy.
And our economic revolution has been matched by a revival of the American spirit: crime down by 20 percent, to its lowest level in 25 years; teen births down 7 years in a row; adoptions up by 30 percent; welfare rolls cut in half, to their lowest levels in 30 years.
My fellow Americans, the state of our Union is the strongest it has ever been.
As always, the real credit belongs to the American people. My gratitude also goes to those of you in this Chamber who have worked with us to put progress over partisanship.
Eight years ago, it was not so clear to most Americans there would be much to celebrate in the year 2000. Then our Nation was gripped by economic distress, social decline, political gridlock. The title of a best-selling book asked: ""America: What Went Wrong?""
In the best traditions of our Nation, Americans determined to set things right. We restored the vital center, replacing outmoded ideologies with a new vision anchored in basic, enduring values: opportunity for all, responsibility from all, a community of all Americans. We reinvented Government, transforming it into a catalyst for new ideas that stress both opportunity and responsibility and give our people the tools they need to solve their own problems.
With the smallest Federal work force in 40 years, we turned record deficits into record surpluses and doubled our investment in education. We cut crime with 100,000 community police and the Brady law, which has kept guns out of the hands of half a million criminals.
We ended welfare as we knew it, requiring work while protecting health care and nutrition for children and investing more in child care, transportation, and housing to help their parents go to work. We've helped parents to succeed at home and at work with family leave, which 20 million Americans have now used to care for a newborn child or a sick loved one. We've engaged 150,000 young Americans in citizen service through AmeriCorps, while helping them earn money for college.
In 1992, we just had a roadmap. Today, we have results.
Even more important, America again has the confidence to dream big dreams. But we must not let this confidence drift into complacency. For we, all of us, will be judged by the dreams and deeds we pass on to our children. And on that score, we will be held to a high standard, indeed, because our chance to do good is so great.
My fellow Americans, we have crossed the bridge we built to the 21st century. Now, we must shape a 21st century American revolution of opportunity, responsibility, and community. We must be now, as we were in the beginning, a new nation.
At the dawn of the last century, Theodore Roosevelt said, ""The one characteristic more essential than any other is foresight . . . it should be the growing Nation with a future that takes the long look ahead."" So tonight let us take our long look ahead and set great goals for our Nation.
To 21st century America, let us pledge these things: Every child will begin school ready to learn and graduate ready to succeed. Every family will be able to succeed at home and at work, and no child will be raised in poverty. We will meet the challenge of the aging of America. We will assure quality, affordable health care, at last, for all Americans. We will make America the safest big country on Earth. We will pay off our national debt for the first time since 1835.* We will bring prosperity to every American community. We will reverse the course of climate change and leave a safer, cleaner planet. America will lead the world toward shared peace and prosperity and the far frontiers of science and technology. And we will become at last what our Founders pledged us to be so long ago: One Nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
These are great goals, worthy of a great nation. We will not reach them all this year, not even in this decade. But we will reach them. Let us remember that the first American Revolution was not won with a single shot; the continent was not settled in a single year. The lesson of our history and the lesson of the last 7 years is that great goals are reached step by step, always building on our progress, always gaining ground.
Of course, you can't gain ground if you're standing still. And for too long this Congress has been standing still on some of our most pressing national priorities. So let's begin tonight with them.
Again, I ask you to pass a real Patients' Bill of Rights. I ask you to pass commonsense gun safety legislation. I ask you to pass campaign finance reform. I ask you to vote up or down on judicial nominations and other important appointees. And again, I ask you—I implore you to raise the minimum wage.
Now, 2 years ago—let me try to balance the seesaw here—[laughter]—2 years ago, as we reached across party lines to reach our first balanced budget, I asked that we meet our responsibility to the next generation by maintaining our fiscal discipline. Because we refused to stray from that path, we are doing something that would have seemed unimaginable 7 years ago. We are actually paying down the national debt. Now, if we stay on this path, we can pay down the debt entirely in just 13 years now and make America debt-free for the first time since Andrew Jackson was President in 1835.
In 1993 we began to put our fiscal house in order with the Deficit Reduction Act, which you'll all remember won passages in both Houses by just a single vote. Your former colleague, my first Secretary of the Treasury, led that effort and sparked our long boom. He's here with us tonight. Lloyd Bentsen, you have served America well, and we thank you.
Beyond paying off the debt, we must ensure that the benefits of debt reduction go to preserving two of the most important guarantees we make to every American, Social Security and Medicare. Tonight I ask you to work with me to make a bipartisan downpayment on Social Security reform by crediting the interest savings from debt reduction to the Social Security Trust Fund so that it will be strong and sound for the next 50 years.
But this is just the start of our journey. We must also take the right steps toward reaching our great goals. First and foremost, we need a 21st century revolution in education, guided by our faith that every single child can learn. Because education is more important than ever, more than ever the key to our children's future, we must make sure all our children have that key. That means quality preschool and afterschool, the best trained teachers in the classroom, and college opportunities for all our children.
For 7 years now, we've worked hard to improve our schools, with opportunity and responsibility, investing more but demanding more in turn. Reading, math, college entrance scores are up. Some of the most impressive gains are in schools in very poor neighborhoods.
But all successful schools have followed the same proven formula: higher standards, more accountability, and extra help so children who need it can get it to reach those standards. I have sent Congress a reform plan based on that formula. It holds States and school districts accountable for progress and rewards them for results. Each year, our National Government invests more than $15 billion in our schools. It is time to support what works and stop supporting what doesn't.
Now, as we demand more from our schools, we should also invest more in our schools. Let's double our investment to help States and districts turn around their worst performing schools or shut them down. Let's double our investments in after-school and summer school programs, which boost achievement and keep people off the streets and out of trouble. If we do this, we can give every single child in every failing school in America—everyone—the chance to meet high standards.
Since 1993, we've nearly doubled our investment in Head Start and improved its quality. Tonight I ask you for another $1 billion for Head Start, the largest increase in the history of the program.
We know that children learn best in smaller classes with good teachers. For 2 years in a row, Congress has supported my plan to hire 100,000 new qualified teachers to lower class size in the early grades. I thank you for that, and I ask you to make it 3 in a row. And to make sure all teachers know the subjects they teach, tonight I propose a new teacher quality initiative, to recruit more talented people into the classroom, reward good teachers for staying there, and give all teachers the training they need.
We know charter schools provide real public school choice. When I became President, there was just one independent public charter school in all America. Today, thanks to you, there are 1,700. I ask you now to help us meet our goal of 3,000 charter schools by next year.
We know we must connect all our classrooms to the Internet, and we're getting there. In 1994, only 3 percent of our classrooms were connected. Today, with the help of the Vice President's E-rate program, more than half of them are, and 90 percent of our schools have at least one Internet connection. But we cannot finish the job when a third of all our schools are in serious disrepair. Many of them have walls and wires so old, they're too old for the Internet. So tonight I propose to help 5,000 schools a year make immediate and urgent repairs and, again, to help build or modernize 6,000 more, to get students out of trailers and into high-tech classrooms.
I ask all of you to help me double our bipartisan GEAR UP program, which provides mentors for disadvantaged young people. If we double it, we can provide mentors for 1.4 million of them. Let's also offer these kids from disadvantaged backgrounds the same chance to take the same college test-prep courses wealthier students use to boost their test scores.
To make the American dream achievable for all, we must make college affordable for all. For 7 years, on a bipartisan basis, we have taken action toward that goal: larger Pell grants, more affordable student loans, education IRA's, and our HOPE scholarships, which have already benefited 5 million young people.
Now, 67 percent of high school graduates are going on to college. That's up 10 percent since 1993. Yet millions of families still strain to pay college tuition. They need help. So I propose a landmark $30 billion college opportunity tax cut, a middle class tax deduction for up to $10,000 in college tuition costs. The previous actions of this Congress have already made 2 years of college affordable for all. It's time make 4 years of college affordable for all. If we take all these steps, we'll move a long way toward making sure every child starts school ready to learn and graduates ready to succeed.
We also need a 21st century revolution to reward work and strengthen families by giving every parent the tools to succeed at work and at the most important work of all, raising children. That means making sure every family has health care and the support to care for aging parents, the tools to bring their children up right, and that no child grows up in poverty.
From my first days as President, we've worked to give families better access to better health care. In 1997, we passed the Children's Health Insurance Program—CHIP—so that workers who don't have coverage through their employers at least can get it for their children. So far, we've enrolled 2 million children. We're well on our way to our goal of 5 million.
But there are still more than 40 million of our fellow Americans without health insurance, more than there were in 1993. Tonight I propose that we follow Vice President Gore's suggestion to make low income parents eligible for the insurance that covers their children. Together with our children's initiative—think of this—together with our children's initiative, this action would enable us to cover nearly a quarter of all the uninsured people in America.
Again, I want to ask you to let people between the ages of 55 and 65, the fastest growing group of uninsured, buy into Medicare. And this year I propose to give them a tax credit to make that choice an affordable one. I hope you will support that, as well.
When the baby boomers retire, Medicare will be faced with caring for twice as many of our citizens; yet, it is far from ready to do so. My generation must not ask our children's generation to shoulder our burden. We simply must act now to strengthen and modernize Medicare.
My budget includes a comprehensive plan to reform Medicare, to make it more efficient and more competitive. And it dedicates nearly $400 billion of our budget surplus to keep Medicare solvent past 2025. And at long last, it also provides funds to give every senior a voluntary choice of affordable coverage for prescription drugs.
Lifesaving drugs are an indispensable part of modern medicine. No one creating a Medicare program today would even think of excluding coverage for prescription drugs. Yet more than three in five of our seniors now lack dependable drug coverage which can lengthen and enrich their lives. Millions of older Americans, who need prescription drugs the most, pay the highest prices for them. In good conscience, we cannot let another year pass without extending to all our seniors this lifeline of affordable prescription drugs.
Record numbers of Americans are providing for aging or ailing loved ones at home. It's a loving but a difficult and often very expensive choice. Last year, I proposed a $1,000 tax credit for long-term care. Frankly, it wasn't enough. This year, let's triple it to $3,000. But this year, let's pass it.
We also have to make needed investments to expand access to mental health care. I want to take a moment to thank the person who led our first White House Conference on Mental Health last year and who for 7 years has led all our efforts to break down the barriers to decent treatment of people with mental illness. Thank you, Tipper Gore.
Taken together, these proposals would mark the largest investment in health care in the 35 years since Medicare was created—the largest investment in 35 years. That would be a big step toward assuring quality health care for all Americans, young and old. And I ask you to embrace them and pass them.
We must also make investments that reward work and support families. Nothing does that better than the earned-income tax credit, the EITC. The ""E"" in the EITC is about earning, working, taking responsibility, and being rewarded for it. In my very first address to you, I asked Congress to greatly expand this credit, and you did. As a result, in 1998 alone, the EITC helped more than 4.3 million Americans work their way out of poverty toward the middle class. That's double the number in 1993.
Tonight I propose another major expansion of the EITC: to reduce the marriage penalty, to make sure it rewards marriage as it rewards work, and also to expand the tax credit for families that have more than two children. It punishes people with more than two children today. Our proposal would allow families with three or more children to get up to $1,100 more in tax relief. These are working families; their children should not be in poverty.
We also can't reward work and family unless men and women get equal pay for equal work. Today the female unemployment rate is the lowest it has been in 46 years. Yet, women still only earn about 75 cents for every dollar men earn. We must do better, by providing the resources to enforce present equal pay laws, training more women for high-paying, high-tech jobs, and passing the ""Paycheck Fairness Act.""
Many working parents spend up to a quarter—a quarter—of their income on child care. Last year, we helped parents provide child care for about 2 million children. My child care initiative before you now, along with funds already secured in welfare reform, would make child care better, safer, and more affordable for another 400,000 children. I ask you to pass that. They need it out there.
For hard-pressed middle income families, we should also expand the child care tax credit. And I believe strongly we should take the next big step and make that tax credit refundable for low income families. For people making under $30,000 a year, that could mean up to $2,400 for child care costs. You know, we all say we're pro-work and pro-family. Passing this proposal would prove it.
Ten of millions of Americans live from paycheck to paycheck. As hard as they work, they still don't have the opportunity to save. Too few can make use of IRA's and 401k plans. We should do more to help all working families save and accumulate wealth. That's the idea behind the Individual Development Accounts, the IDA's. I ask you to take that idea to a new level, with new retirement savings accounts that enable every low and moderate income family in America to save for retirement, a first home, a medical emergency, or a college education. I propose to match their contributions, however small, dollar for dollar, every year they save. And I propose to give a major new tax credit to any small business that will provide a meaningful pension to its workers. Those people ought to have retirement as well as the rest of us.
Nearly one in three American children grows up without a father. These children are 5 times more likely to live in poverty than children with both parents at home. Clearly, demanding and supporting responsible fatherhood is critical to lifting all our children out of poverty. We've doubled child support collections since 1992. And I'm proposing to you tough new measures to hold still more fathers responsible.
But we should recognize that a lot of fathers want to do right by their children but need help to do it. Carlos Rosas of St. Paul, Minnesota, wanted to do right by his son, and he got the help to do it. Now he's got a good job, and he supports his little boy. My budget will help 40,000 more fathers make the same choices Carlos Rosas did. I thank him for being here tonight. Stand up, Carlos. [Applause] Thank you.
If there is any single issue on which we should be able to reach across party lines, it is in our common commitment to reward work and strengthen families. Just remember what we did last year. We came together to help people with disabilities keep their health insurance when they go to work. And I thank you for that. Thanks to overwhelming bipartisan support from this Congress, we have improved foster care. We've helped those young people who leave it when they turn 18, and we have dramatically increased the number of foster care children going into adoptive homes. I thank all of you for all of that.
Of course, I am forever grateful to the person who has led our efforts from the beginning and who's worked so tirelessly for children and families for 30 years now, my wife, Hillary, and I thank her.
If we take the steps just discussed, we can go a long, long way toward empowering parents to succeed at home and at work and ensuring that no child is raised in poverty. We can make these vital investments in health care, education, support for working families, and still offer tax cuts to help pay for college, for retirement, to care for aging parents, to reduce the marriage penalty. We can do these things without forsaking the path of fiscal discipline that got us to this point here tonight. Indeed, we must make these investments and these tax cuts in the context of a balanced budget that strengthens and extends the life of Social Security and Medicare and pays down the national debt.
Crime in America has dropped for the past 7 years—that's the longest decline on record— thanks to a national consensus we helped to forge on community police, sensible gun safety laws, and effective prevention. But nobody, nobody here, nobody in America believes we're safe enough. So again, I ask you to set a higher goal. Let's make this country the safest big country in the world.
Last fall, Congress supported my plan to hire, in addition to the 100,000 community police we've already funded, 50,000 more, concentrated in high-crime neighborhoods. I ask your continued support for that.
Soon after the Columbine tragedy, Congress considered commonsense gun legislation, to require Brady background checks at the gun shows, child safety locks for new handguns, and a ban on the importation of large capacity ammunition clips. With courage and a tie-breaking vote by the Vice President—[laughter]—the Senate faced down the gun lobby, stood up for the American people, and passed this legislation. But the House failed to follow suit.
Now, we have all seen what happens when guns fall into the wrong hands. Daniel Mauser was only 15 years old when he was gunned down at Columbine. He was an amazing kid, a straight-A student, a good skier. Like all parents who lose their children, his father, Tom, has borne unimaginable grief. Somehow he has found the strength to honor his son by transforming his grief into action. Earlier this month, he took a leave of absence from his job to fight for tougher gun safety laws. I pray that his courage and wisdom will at long last move this Congress to make commonsense gun legislation the very next order of business. Tom Mauser, stand up. We thank you for being here tonight. Tom. Thank you, Tom. [Applause]
We must strengthen our gun laws and enforce those already on the books better. Federal gun crime prosecutions are up 16 percent since I took office. But we must do more. I propose to hire more Federal and local gun prosecutors and more ATF agents to crack down on illegal gun traffickers and bad-apple dealers. And we must give them the enforcement tools that they need, tools to trace every gun and every bullet used in every gun crime in the United States. I ask you to help us do that.
Every State in this country already requires hunters and automobile drivers to have a license. I think they ought to do the same thing for handgun purchases. Now, specifically, I propose a plan to ensure that all new handgun buyers must first have a photo license from their State showing they passed the Brady background check and a gun safety course, before they get the gun. I hope you'll help me pass that in this Congress.
Listen to this—listen to this. The accidental gun rate—the accidental gun death rate of children under 15 in the United States is 9 times higher than in the other 25 industrialized countries combined. Now, technologies now exist that could lead to guns that can only be fired by the adults who own them. I ask Congress to fund research into smart gun technology to save these children's lives. I ask responsible leaders in the gun industry to work with us on smart guns and other steps to keep guns out of the wrong hands, to keep our children safe.
You know, every parent I know worries about the impact of violence in the media on their children. I want to begin by thanking the entertainment industry for accepting my challenge to put voluntary ratings on TV programs and video and Internet games. But frankly, the ratings are too numerous, diverse, and confusing to be really useful to parents. So tonight I ask the industry to accept the First Lady's challenge to develop a single voluntary rating system for all children's entertainment that is easier for parents to understand and enforce.
The steps I outline will take us well on our way to making America the safest big country in the world.
Now, to keep our historic economic expansion going, the subject of a lot of discussion in this community and others, I believe we need a 21st century revolution to open new markets, start new businesses, hire new workers right here in America, in our inner cities, poor rural areas, and Native American reservations.
Our Nation's prosperity hasn't yet reached these places. Over the last 6 months, I've traveled to a lot of them, joined by many of you and many far-sighted business people, to shine a spotlight on the enormous potential in communities from Appalachia to the Mississippi Delta, from Watts to the Pine Ridge Reservation. Everywhere I go, I meet talented people eager for opportunity and able to work. Tonight I ask you, let's put them to work. For business, it's the smart thing to do. For America, it's the right thing to do. And let me ask you something: If we don't do this now, when in the wide world will we ever get around to it?
So I ask Congress to give businesses the same incentives to invest in America's new markets they now have to invest in markets overseas. Tonight I propose a large new markets tax credit and other incentives to spur $22 billion in private-sector capital to create new businesses and new investments in our inner cities and rural areas. Because empowerment zones have been creating these opportunities for 5 years now, I also ask you to increase incentives to invest in them and to create more of them.
And let me say to all of you again what I have tried to say at every turn: This is not a Democratic or a Republican issue. Giving people a chance to live their dreams is an American issue.
Mr. Speaker, it was a powerful moment last November when you joined Reverend Jesse Jackson and me in your home State of Illinois and committed to working toward our common goal by combining the best ideas from both sides of the aisle. I want to thank you again and to tell you, Mr. Speaker, I look forward to working with you. This is a worthy joint endeavor. Thank you.
I also ask you to make special efforts to address the areas of our Nation with the highest rates of poverty, our Native American reservations and the Mississippi Delta. My budget includes a $110 million initiative to promote economic development in the Delta and a billion dollars to increase economic opportunity, health care, education, and law enforcement for our Native American communities. We should begin this new century by honoring our historic responsibility to empower the first Americans. And I want to thank tonight the leaders and the members from both parties who've expressed to me an interest in working with us on these efforts. They are profoundly important.
There's another part of our American community in trouble tonight, our family farmers. When I signed the farm bill in 1996, I said there was great danger it would work well in good times but not in bad. Well, droughts, floods, and historically low prices have made these times very bad for the farmers. We must work together to strengthen the farm safety net, invest in land conservation, and create some new markets for them by expanding our programs for bio-based fuels and products. Please, they need help. Let's do it together.
Opportunity for all requires something else today, having access to a computer and knowing how to use it. That means we must close the digital divide between those who've got the tools and those who don't. Connecting classrooms and libraries to the Internet is crucial, but it's just a start. My budget ensures that all new teachers are trained to teach 21st century skills, and it creates technology centers in 1,000 communities to serve adults. This spring, I'll invite high-tech leaders to join me on another new markets tour, to close the digital divide and open opportunity for our people. I want to thank the high-tech companies that already are doing so much in this area. I hope the new tax incentives I have proposed will get all the rest of them to join us. This is a national crusade. We have got to do this and do it quickly.
Now, again I say to you, these are steps, but step by step, we can go a long way toward our goal of bringing opportunity to every community.
To realize the full possibilities of this economy, we must reach beyond our own borders to shape the revolution that is tearing down barriers and building new networks among nations and individuals and economies and cultures: globalization. It's the central reality of our time.
Of course, change this profound is both liberating and threatening to people. But there's no turning back. And our open, creative society stands to benefit more than any other if we understand and act on the realities of interdependence. We have to be at the center of every vital global network, as a good neighbor and a good partner. We have to recognize that we cannot build our future without helping others to build theirs.
The first thing we have got to do is to forge a new consensus on trade. Now, those of us who believe passionately in the power of open trade, we have to ensure that it lifts both our living standards and our values, never tolerating abusive child labor or a race to the bottom in the environment and worker protection. But others must recognize that open markets and rule-based trade are the best engines we know of for raising living standards, reducing global poverty and environmental destruction, and assuring the free flow of ideas.
I believe, as strongly tonight as I did the first day I got here, the only direction forward for America on trade—the only direction for America on trade is to keep going forward. I ask you to help me forge that consensus. We have to make developing economies our partners in prosperity. That's why I would like to ask you again to finalize our groundbreaking African and Caribbean Basin trade initiatives.
But globalization is about more than economics. Our purpose must be to bring together the world around freedom and democracy and peace and to oppose those who would tear it apart. Here are the fundamental challenges I believe America must meet to shape the 21st century world.
First, we must continue to encourage our former adversaries, Russia and China, to emerge as stable, prosperous, democratic nations. Both are being held back today from reaching their full potential: Russia by the legacy of communism, an economy in turmoil, a cruel and self-defeating war in Chechnya; China by the illusion that it can buy stability at the expense of freedom.
But think how much has changed in the past decade: 5,000 former Soviet nuclear weapons taken out of commission; Russian soldiers actually serving with ours in the Balkans; Russian people electing their leaders for the first time in 1,000 years; and in China, an economy more open to the world than ever before.
Of course, no one, not a single person in this Chamber tonight can know for sure what direction these great nations will take. But we do know for sure that we can choose what we do. And we should do everything in our power to increase the chance that they will choose wisely, to be constructive members of our global community.
That's why we should support those Russians who are struggling for a democratic, prosperous future; continue to reduce both our nuclear arsenals; and help Russia to safeguard weapons and materials that remain.
And that's why I believe Congress should support the agreement we negotiated to bring China into the WTO, by passing permanent normal trade relations with China as soon as possible this year. I think you ought to do it for two reasons: First of all, our markets are already open to China; this agreement will open China's markets to us. And second, it will plainly advance the cause of peace in Asia and promote the cause of change in China. No, we don't know where it's going. All we can do is decide what we're going to do. But when all is said and done, we need to know we did everything we possibly could to maximize the chance that China will choose the right future.
A second challenge we've got is to protect our own security from conflicts that pose the risk of wider war and threaten our common humanity. We can't prevent every conflict or stop every outrage. But where our interests are at stake and we can make a difference, we should be, and we must be, peacemakers.
We should be proud of our role in bringing the Middle East closer to a lasting peace, building peace in Northern Ireland, working for peace in East Timor and Africa, promoting reconciliation between Greece and Turkey and in Cyprus, working to defuse these crises between India and Pakistan, in defending human rights and religious freedom. And we should be proud of the men and women of our Armed Forces and those of our allies who stopped the ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, enabling a million people to return to their homes.
When Slobodan Milosevic unleashed his terror on Kosovo, Captain John Cherrey was one of the brave airmen who turned the tide. And when another American plane was shot down over Serbia, he flew into the teeth of enemy air defenses to bring his fellow pilot home. Thanks to our Armed Forces' skill and bravery, we prevailed in Kosovo without losing a single American in combat. I want to introduce Captain Cherrey to you. We honor Captain Cherrey, and we promise you, Captain, we'll finish the job you began. Stand up so we can see you. [Applause]
A third challenge we have is to keep this inexorable march of technology from giving terrorists and potentially hostile nations the means to undermine our defenses. Keep in mind, the same technological advances that have shrunk cell phones to fit in the palms of our hands can also make weapons of terror easier to conceal and easier to use.
We must meet this threat by making effective agreements to restrain nuclear and missile programs in North Korea, curbing the flow of lethal technology to Iran, preventing Iraq from threatening its neighbors, increasing our preparedness against chemical and biological attack, protecting our vital computer systems from hackers and criminals, and developing a system to defend against new missile threats, while working to preserve our ABM missile treaty with Russia. We must do all these things.
I predict to you, when most of us are long gone but some time in the next 10 to 20 years, the major security threat this country will face will come from the enemies of the nation-state, the narcotraffickers and the terrorists and the organized criminals who will be organized together, working together, with increasing access to ever more sophisticated chemical and biological weapons. And I want to thank the Pentagon and others for doing what they're doing right now to try to help protect us and plan for that, so that our defenses will be strong. I ask for your support to ensure they can succeed.
I also want to ask you for a constructive bipartisan dialog this year to work to build a consensus which I hope will eventually lead to the ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.
I hope we can also have a constructive effort to meet the challenge that is presented to our planet by the huge gulf between rich and poor. We cannot accept a world in which part of humanity lives on the cutting edge of a new economy and the rest live on the bare edge of survival. I think we have to do our part to change that with expanded trade, expanded aid, and the expansion of freedom.
This is interesting: From Nigeria to Indonesia, more people got the right to choose their leaders in 1999 than in 1989, when the Berlin Wall fell. We've got to stand by these democracies, including and especially tonight Colombia, which is fighting narcotraffickers, for its own people's lives and our children's lives. I have proposed a strong 2-year package to help Colombia win this fight. I want to thank the leaders in both parties in both Houses for listening to me and the President of Colombia about it. We have got to pass this. I want to ask your help. A lot is riding on it. And it's so important for the long-term stability of our country and for what happens in Latin America.
I also want you to know I'm going to send you new legislation to go after what these drug barons value the most, their money. And I hope you'll pass that as well.
In a world where over a billion people live on less than a dollar a day, we also have got to do our part in the global endeavor to reduce the debts of the poorest countries, so they can invest in education, health care, and economic growth. That's what the Pope and other religious leaders have urged us to do. And last year, Congress made a downpayment on America's share. I ask you to continue that. I thank you for what you did and ask you to stay the course.
I also want to say that America must help more nations to break the bonds of disease. Last year in Africa, 10 times as many people died from AIDS as were killed in wars—10 times. The budget I give you invests $150 million more in the fight against this and other infectious killers. And today I propose a tax credit to speed the development of vaccines for diseases like malaria, TB, and AIDS. I ask the private sector and our partners around the world to join us in embracing this cause. We can save millions of lives together, and we ought to do it.
I also want to mention our final challenge, which, as always, is the most important. I ask you to pass a national security budget that keeps our military the best trained and best equipped in the world, with heightened readiness and 21st century weapons, which raises salaries for our service men and women, which protects our veterans, which fully funds the diplomacy that keeps our soldiers out of war, which makes good on our commitment to our U.N. dues and arrears. I ask you to pass this budget.
I also want to say something, if I might, very personal tonight. The American people watching us at home, with the help of all the commentators, can tell, from who stands and who sits and who claps and who doesn't, that there's still modest differences of opinion in this room. [Laughter] But I want to thank you for something, every one of you. I want to thank you for the extraordinary support you have given, Republicans and Democrats alike, to our men and women in uniform. I thank you for that.
I also want to thank, especially, two people. First, I want to thank our Secretary of Defense, Bill Cohen, for symbolizing our bipartisan commitment to national security. Thank you, sir. Even more, I want to thank his wife, Janet, who, more than any other American citizen, has tirelessly traveled this world to show the support we all feel for our troops. Thank you, Janet Cohen. I appreciate that. Thank you.
These are the challenges we have to meet so that we can lead the world toward peace and freedom in an era of globalization.
I want to tell you that I am very grateful for many things as President. But one of the things I'm grateful for is the opportunity that the Vice President and I have had to finally put to rest the bogus idea that you cannot grow the economy and protect the environment at the same time.
As our economy has grown, we've rid more than 500 neighborhoods of toxic waste, ensured cleaner air and water for millions of people. In the past 3 months alone, we've helped preserve 40 million acres of roadless lands in the national forests, created three new national monuments.
But as our communities grow, our commitment to conservation must continue to grow. Tonight I propose creating a permanent conservation fund, to restore wildlife, protect coastlines, save natural treasures, from the California redwoods to the Florida Everglades. This lands legacy endowment would represent by far the most enduring investment in land preservation ever proposed in this House. I hope we can get together with all the people with different ideas and do this. This is a gift we should give to our children and our grandchildren for all time, across party lines. We can make an agreement to do this.
Last year the Vice President launched a new effort to make communities more liberal—livable—[laughter]—liberal, I know. [Laughter] Wait a minute, I've got a punchline now. That's this year's agenda; last year was livable, right? [Laughter] That's what Senator Lott is going to say in the commentary afterwards—[laughter]—to make our communities more livable. This is big business. This is a big issue. What does that mean? You ask anybody that lives in an unlivable community, and they'll tell you. They want their kids to grow up next to parks, not parking lots; the parents don't have to spend all their time stalled in traffic when they could be home with their children.
Tonight I ask you to support new funding for the following things, to make American communities more liberal—livable. [Laughter] I've done pretty well with this speech, but I can't say that.
One, I want you to help us to do three things. We need more funding for advanced transit systems. We need more funding for saving open spaces in places of heavy development. And we need more funding—this ought to have bipartisan appeal—we need more funding for helping major cities around the Great Lakes protect their waterways and enhance their quality of life. We need these things, and I want you to help us.
The greatest environmental challenge of the new century is global warming. The scientists tell us the 1990's were the hottest decade of the entire millennium. If we fail to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases, deadly heat waves and droughts will become more frequent, coastal areas will flood, and economies will be disrupted. That is going to happen, unless we act.
Many people in the United States, some people in this Chamber, and lots of folks around the world still believe you cannot cut greenhouse gas emissions without slowing economic growth. In the industrial age, that may well have been true. But in this digital economy, it is not true anymore. New technologies make it possible to cut harmful emissions and provide even more growth.
For example, just last week, automakers unveiled cars that get 70 to 80 miles a gallon, the fruits of a unique research partnership between Government and industry. And before you know it, efficient production of bio-fuels will give us the equivalent of hundreds of miles from a gallon of gasoline.
To speed innovation in these kind of technologies, I think we should give a major tax incentive to business for the production of clean energy and to families for buying energy-saving homes and appliances and the next generation of superefficient cars when they hit the showroom floor. I also ask the auto industry to use the available technologies to make all new cars more fuel-efficient right away.
And I ask this Congress to do something else. Please help us make more of our clean energy technology available to the developing world. That will create cleaner growth abroad and a lot more new jobs here in the United States of America.
In the new century, innovations in science and technology will be key not only to the health of the environment but to miraculous improvements in the quality of our lives and advances in the economy. Later this year, researchers will complete the first draft of the entire human genome, the very blueprint of life. It is important for all our fellow Americans to recognize that Federal tax dollars have funded much of this research and that this and other wise investments in science are leading to a revolution in our ability to detect, treat, and prevent disease.
For example, researchers have identified genes that cause Parkinson's, diabetes, and certain kinds of cancer. They are designing precision therapies that will block the harmful effect of these genes for good. Researchers already are using this new technique to target and destroy cells that cause breast cancer. Soon, we may be able to use it to prevent the onset of Alzheimer's. Scientists are also working on an artificial retina to help many blind people to see and—listen to this—microchips that would actually directly stimulate damaged spinal cords in a way that could allow people now paralyzed to stand up and walk.
These kinds of innovations are also propelling our remarkable prosperity. Information technology only includes 8 percent of our employment but now accounts for a third of our economic growth along with jobs that pay, by the way, about 80 percent above the private sector average. Again, we ought to keep in mind, Government-funded research brought supercomputers, the Internet, and communications satellites into being. Soon researchers will bring us devices that can translate foreign languages as fast as you can talk, materials 10 times stronger than steel at a fraction of the weight, and— this is unbelievable to me—molecular computers the size of a teardrop with the power of today's fastest supercomputers.
To accelerate the march of discovery across all these disciplines in science and technology, I ask you to support my recommendation of an unprecedented $3 billion in the 21st century research fund, the largest increase in civilian research in a generation. We owe it to our future.
Now, these new breakthroughs have to be used in ways that reflect our values. First and foremost, we have to safeguard our citizens' privacy. Last year we proposed to protect every citizen's medical record. This year we will finalize those rules. We've also taken the first steps to protect the privacy of bank and credit card records and other financial statements. Soon I will send legislation to you to finish that job. We must also act to prevent any genetic discrimination whatever by employers or insurers. I hope you will support that.
These steps will allow us to lead toward the far frontiers of science and technology. They will enhance our health, the environment, the economy in ways we can't even imagine today. But we all know that at a time when science, technology, and the forces of globalization are bringing so many changes into all our lives, it's more important than ever that we strengthen the bonds that root us in our local communities and in our national community.
No tie binds different people together like citizen service. There's a new spirit of service in America, a movement we've tried to support with AmeriCorps, expanded Peace Corps, unprecedented new partnerships with businesses, foundations, community groups; partnerships, for example, like the one that enlisted 12,000 companies which have now moved 650,000 of our fellow citizens from welfare to work; partnerships to battle drug abuse, AIDS, teach young people to read, save America's treasures, strengthen the arts, fight teen pregnancy, prevent violence among young people, promote racial healing. The American people are working together.
But we should do more to help Americans help each other. First, we should help faithbased organizations to do more to fight poverty and drug abuse and help people get back on the right track, with initiatives like Second Chance Homes that do so much to help unwed teen mothers. Second, we should support Americans who tithe and contribute to charities but don't earn enough to claim a tax deduction for it. Tonight I propose new tax incentives that would allow low and middle income citizens who don't itemize to get that deduction. It's nothing but fair, and it will get more people to give.
We should do more to help new immigrants to fully participate in our community. That's why I recommend spending more to teach them civics and English. And since everybody in our community counts, we've got to make sure everyone is counted in this year's census.
Within 10 years—just 10 years—there will be no majority race in our largest State of California. In a little more than 50 years, there will be no majority race in America. In a more interconnected world, this diversity can be our greatest strength. Just look around this Chamber. Look around. We have Members in this Congress from virtually every racial, ethnic, and religious background. And I think you would agree that America is stronger because of it. [Applause]
You also have to agree that all those differences you just clapped for all too often spark hatred and division even here at home. Just in the last couple of years, we've seen a man dragged to death in Texas just because he was black. We saw a young man murdered in Wyoming just because he was gay. Last year we saw the shootings of African-Americans, Asian-Americans, and Jewish children just because of who they were. This is not the American way, and we must draw the line.
I ask you to draw that line by passing without delay the ""Hate Crimes Prevention Act"" and the ""Employment Non-Discrimination Act."" And I ask you to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act.
Finally tonight, I propose the largest ever investment in our civil rights laws for enforcement, because no American should be subjected to discrimination in finding a home, getting a job, going to school, or securing a loan. Protections in law should be protections in fact.
Last February, because I thought this was so important, I created the White House Office of One America to promote racial reconciliation. That's what one of my personal heroes, Hank Aaron, has done all his life. From his days as our all-time home run king to his recent acts of healing, he has always brought people together. We should follow his example, and we're honored to have him with us tonight. Stand up, Hank Aaron. [Applause]
I just want to say one more thing about this, and I want every one of you to think about this the next time you get mad at one of your colleagues on the other side of the aisle. This fall, at the White House, Hillary had one of her millennium dinners, and we had this very distinguished scientist there, who is an expert in this whole work in the human genome. And he said that we are all, regardless of race, genetically 99.9 percent the same.
Now, you may find that uncomfortable when you look around here. [Laughter] But it is worth remembering. We can laugh about this, but you think about it. Modern science has confirmed what ancient faiths have always taught: the most important fact of life is our common humanity. Therefore, we should do more than just tolerate our diversity; we should honor it and celebrate it.
My fellow Americans, every time I prepare for the State of the Union, I approach it with hope and expectation and excitement for our Nation. But tonight is very special, because we stand on the mountaintop of a new millennium. Behind us we can look back and see the great expanse of American achievement, and before us we can see even greater, grander frontiers of possibility. We should, all of us, be filled with gratitude and humility for our present progress and prosperity. We should be filled with awe and joy at what lies over the horizon. And we should be filled with absolute determination to make the most of it.
You know, when the Framers finished crafting our Constitution in Philadelphia, Benjamin Franklin stood in Independence Hall, and he reflected on the carving of the Sun that was on the back of a chair he saw. The Sun was low on the horizon. So he said this—he said, ""I've often wondered whether that Sun was rising or setting. Today,"" Franklin said, ""I have the happiness to know it's a rising Sun."" Today, because each succeeding generation of Americans has kept the fire of freedom burning brightly, lighting those frontiers of possibility, we all still bask in the glow and the warmth of Mr. Franklin's rising Sun.
After 224 years, the American revolution continues. We remain a new nation. And as long as our dreams outweigh our memories, America will be forever young. That is our destiny. And this is our moment.
Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-before-joint-session-the-congress-the-state-the-union-7
Bill Clinton,"January 29, 2000","Remarks to the World Economic Forum and a Question-and-Answer Session in Davos, Switzerland","President Clinton. Thank you very much. President Schwab, I think that it is an indication of the importance of the topic and the importance of the World Economic Forum that you have so many leaders from around the world here today. I see, just scanning the audience, the President of Colombia, the President of South Africa, Chairman Arafat, the Prime Ministers of Spain and Turkey, and a number of other leaders.
We have here with me today the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Energy, and our Trade Ambassador. There's no one home in Washington to take care of things. [Laughter] We have a large delegation from the United States Congress here; leaders from all over the world in business, public life; the leader of the American union movement, John Sweeney, whom I know has spoken to you.
So I think that maybe the presence of all these distinguished people in the crowd is evidence of the importance of our being here and shows, in my mind, one of the things we need to determine to do as a people.
The World Economic Forum has been at it, as you pointed out, for 30 years now. The thing that I have appreciated most about your deliberations is your consistent focus on the future. For example, you spotted the networking of society before the Internet was out of its infancy. Both Vice President Gore and my wife, Hillary, have spoken here, and I am glad, even though I am late, to finally get in on the act. [Laughter]
Your theme, ""New Beginnings: Making a Difference,"" it seems to me, is the right theme. What I want to ask all of you to think about today is, what does making a difference and new beginnings mean in an era of globalization? What are the opportunities? What are the obligations? What are the hazards? What new beginnings will make a positive difference? And, perhaps the most difficult question of all, do we have the institutional and organized mechanisms to make them?
As we know, in many ways the global economy was almost as integrated as it is today 100 years ago. But after World War I, leaders in the United States and Europe made what all now recognize were false and shortsighted choices. Instead of partnership, they chose protectionism and isolationism. And for decades, globalization went in reverse, with utterly disastrous consequences.
After the second war, the leaders were given a second chance. This time it was clear that what was at stake was not simply the return of prosperity but the defense of freedom. They chose the path of economic and political partnership and set the stage for 50 years of growth across the globe. No one can seriously argue that the world would be a better place today if they had reverted to the old isolationism.
So today, at the start of a new century, the entire world, not simply Europe and the United States and the wealthiest nations of Asia, the entire world finds itself at a crossroads. Globalization is revolutionizing the way we work, the way we live, and perhaps most important, the way we relate to each other across national boundaries. It is tearing down doors and building up networks between nations and individuals, between economies and cultures.
The obvious consequence is that we are growing ever more interdependent, driven to be part of every vital network, understanding we cannot build our own future without helping others to build theirs. Today, we know that because of scientific and technological advance, we can change the equation between energy use and economic growth. We can shatter the limits that time and space pose to doing business and getting an education.
But the openness and mobility, the flexible networking and sophisticated communications technologies that have made globalization what it is, so totally consuming—all these factors have also made us more vulnerable to some of our oldest problems.
Terrorism, narcotraffickers, and organized criminals, they can use all this new technology, too, and take advantage of the openness of societies and borders. They present all of us with new security challenges in the new century. The spread of disease; ethnic, racial, tribal, religious conflicts, rooted in the fear of others who are different—they seem to find ways to spread in this globalized era. And the grinding poverty of more than a billion people who live on less than a dollar a day and live for a year on less than what it costs to stay in a nice hotel at night—they, too, are part of the globalized world. A few of us live on the cutting edge of the new economy; too many of us live on the bare edge of survival, without the means to move up.
Those who wish to roll back the forces of globalization because they fear its disruptive consequences, I believe, are plainly wrong. Fifty years of experience shows that greater economic integration and political cooperation are positive forces. Those who believe globalizaton is only about market economics, however, are wrong, too. All these new networks must lead to new arrangements that work for all, that work to spur growth, lift lives, raise standards, both around the world and within nations.
Now, leaders from business, government, and civil society, therefore, must come together to build a future that can unite, not divide, us. We must recognize, first, that globalization has made us all more free and more interdependent. Those of us who are more fortunate must be more responsible and work harder to be good neighbors and good partners. The United States has a special responsibility in that regard, because we have been so fortunate in our history and so very fortunate over the last decade.
I came here today in the hope that by working together, we can actually find a way to create the conditions and provide the tools to give people on every continent the ability to solve their own problems, and in so doing, to strengthen their own lives and our global economy in the new century.
I would like to make just a few points. First, I think we have got to reaffirm unambiguously that open markets and rules-based trade are the best engine we know of to lift living standards, reduce environmental destruction, and build shared prosperity. This is true whether you're in Detroit, Davos, Dacca, or Dakar. Worldwide, open markets do create jobs. They do raise incomes. They do spark innovation and spread new technology. They do—coupled with the explosion of international communications through the Internet, which is the fastest-growing network in history. For example, when I became President 7 years ago, there were only 50 pages on the World Wide Web. Today, there are over 50 million—in 7 years. Trade broadens the frontiers of possibility for all of those who have access to its benefits and the tools to claim them.
As I said a couple of days ago in my State of the Union Address, for me there is only one direction forward on trade, and that is to go on with what we're doing, recognizing that this is a new and very different world, that the idea that we would be better off with less trade, with less rule-based trade by turning away from our attempts to find international ways within which we can work together, I think is dead wrong.
Now, having said that, what does that mean? Well, for me, it meant that when, first our neighbors in Mexico and then our friends in Asia were in turmoil and crisis, the United States had to keep our markets open, even though it led to record trade deficits. For me, it means it's very important to get China into the World Trade Organization, to ensure that China's markets are open to us—even as we have our markets open to China—and to advance peace and stability in Asia and increase the possibility of positive change in China.
The changes in our markets are only beginning. You know, people have been trading goods across borders as long as there have been borders. But communications technology and the Internet are expanding trade in unprecedented ways many of you understand better than I. Today, everything from data processing to security monitoring to stockbrokering and advanced degrees can be bought and sold all over the world. E-commerce creates enormous potential for growth anywhere, and it will continue to do so if we can resist the temptation to put up barriers to this important part of our new economy.
Trade is especially important, of course, for developing nations. Listen to this—this is something that I think people from the developing nations who oppose the WTO should think about—from the 1970's to the early nineties, developing countries that chose growth through trade grew at least twice as fast as those who chose not to open to the world. The most open countries had growth that was 6 times as fast.
Think about what Japan or the nations of southeastern Europe were like 50 years ago. They were poor, largely rural societies. Today, they are prosperous global leaders, in no small measure because of trade. Look at South Korea, Mexico, or Thailand, which built their growth on openness. Even after the recent traumas of financial crises, their national incomes are still more than double the 1970 levels, when they were more closed. And their gains in literacy, education, and life expectancy are truly extraordinary, far outpacing countries that chose not to open to the world.
Certainly, many of the people who have questioned the wisdom of open trade are genuinely concerned about the fate of the poor and the disadvantaged, and well they should be. But they should ask themselves, what will happen to a Bangladeshi textile worker or a migrant from the Mexican countryside without the prospect of jobs and industry that can sell to foreign as well as domestic consumers? What happens to farmers in Uruguay or Zimbabwe, in Australia, Europe, the United States, if protectionism makes it impossible to market products beyond their borders? How can working conditions be improved and poverty be reduced in developing countries if they are denied these and other opportunities to grow, the things that come with participation in the world economy?
No, trade must not be a race to the bottom, whether we're talking about child labor, basic working conditions, or environmental protection. But turning away from trade would keep part of our global community forever on the bottom. That is not the right response.
Now, that means, it seems to me, that we must face another challenge. The second point I want to make is that developing countries will only reap the benefits of integration in the world economy if the industrialized countries are able to garner enough domestic support for policies that are often controversial at home. It is easier for us to gather here, in vigorous agreement— and I'm glad you brought Mr. Sweeney over so we could have an occasional voice of occasional disagreement.
But most of us here agree with everything I just said. Why? Well, we have seen and personally felt the benefits of globalization. But convincing our publics to go along, to go for greater integration in a rule-based system which might require them to change further and might require some of them, unlike most of us, to change what they do for a living, remains a challenge.
How shall we meet it? In the United States, we must overcome resistance to our groundbreaking trade agreements with Africa and the Caribbean Basin—even though if they both pass, their impact on our economy will be very small, while their impact on the African nations that participate and those in the Caribbean will be very large indeed. I am determined to pass both measures this year, and I think we'll succeed, but it's an indication of what kinds of problems every country faces.
Indeed, you probably have noted this, but one of the most ironic and, to me, disappointing consequences of our unprecedented prosperity, which has given us over 20 million new jobs in my country in the last 7 years, is that it seems to me that protectionist sentiment, or antitrade sentiment at least, is greater now than it was 7 years ago when I took office, in the United States Congress. I want to talk a little about that today and how it relates to what's going on in other countries. But we all have an obligation to work through that, nation by nation.
Part of what countries have to do is to be able to point to what other countries are doing and to say, ""Well, look what they're doing; we ought to do this. We ought to do our part."" That means we are significantly affected in the United States by the policies of Europe, Japan, and other wealthier countries. I think for its part, Europe should put its agricultural subsidies on the table. If even one-third of the world's subsidies and tariffs in agriculture were eliminated, the poorest developing countries that could export would gain more than $4 billion in economic benefits every single year.
We can also, I must say, do better in the developed countries if we are able to make a more forceful case for the value of imports. None of us do this enough, and I must say, I haven't done this enough. We all go around talking about—every time we talk about trade agreements in our countries, we always talk about how many jobs will be created at home because we're opening markets abroad, and we make ourselves vulnerable to people who say, ""But it may not reduce the trade deficit, and look how big it is.""
So I just want to say, I wish everyone here would look at yourselves and ask yourselves if you are wearing anything made in a country other than the country where you live.
There are benefits to imports. We don't just do a favor to developing countries or to our trading partners in developed countries when we import products and services from them. We benefit from those products. Imports stretch family budgets. They promote the well-being of working families by making their dollars go further. They bring new technology and ideas. They, by opening markets, dampen inflation and spur innovation.
In a few days, we will have the longest economic expansion in the history of the United States. I am convinced one of the reasons that it will happen is that we have kept our markets open, even in tough times, so that there has always been pressure to keep inflation down as we continue to generate jobs and growth. I am convinced of it. And those of us in wealthier countries need to make the case that even when we have trade deficits, if we're growing jobs and we're gaining ground and the jobs are growing in areas that pay better wages, we are getting the benefits of imports. I think all people in public life have been insufficiently willing to say that. And we must do more.
The third point I would like to make is that we simply cannot expect trade alone to carry the burden of lifting nations out of poverty. It will not happen. Trade is essential to growth in developing countries, but it is not sufficient for growth in developing countries. Sustained growth requires investment in human capital, education, health care, technology, infrastructure. Particularly in an economy that runs more and more on brainpower, no investment pays off faster than education. The international community has set 2015 as a target for giving every child access to basic education. I'm asking our Congress for more funding to help nations get more children out of work and into school. I hope others in the public and private sectors will join us.
Each year in the developing world, we see millions of lives lost and billions of dollars lost— dollars that could be spent in many more productive ways—to killer diseases like AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis. Last year in Africa, AIDS killed more people—10 times more—than all the wars did. We have the technology to find vaccines for those diseases. We have medications that can lengthen and improve the quality of life.
But let's face a fact. The pharmaceutical industry has no incentive to develop products for customers who are too poor to buy them. I have proposed a tax credit to say to our private industry, if you will develop these vaccines, we'll help to pay for them. I hope the World Bank, other nations, and the corporate world will help us in meeting this challenge. If we could get the vaccines out to the people who need them in time, we could save millions and millions of lives and free up billions of dollars to be invested in building those lives, those societies into strong, productive partners, not just for trade but for peace.
We can also help countries help themselves by lifting their crippling burden of debt, so they'll have more to invest in their people and their future. The Cologne debt initiative commits us to reducing the foreign debt of the world's poorest and most indebted nations by as much as 70 percent. Last fall I pledged that the United States would forgive 100 percent of the debts those countries owe to us. This year I will work to fund our share of the multilateral debt relief. I am pleased that so many others have made similar pledges and look forward to the first countries benefiting from this initiative very soon. If we keep working on this, expanding it, and we all pay our fair share, we can turn a vicious cycle of debt and poverty into a virtuous cycle of development and trade.
The last point I'd like to make on this is that I think the developed countries who want an open trading system that has the trust and confidence of developing countries should also contribute to indigenous trade, which may not be directly related—excuse me, indigenous economic development, which may not be directly related to trade. Just for example, the United States Agency for International Development each year funds about 2 million microenterprise loans in poor communities in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.
I will never forget going to small villages in Senegal and Uganda and seeing people who had gotten their first business loan—sometimes as small as $50—show me their businesses, show me the people they were doing business with in their villages, who had also gotten such loans. I'll never forget the man in Senegal who was this designated village accountant, making me wait outside his front door while he went into his house to bring me back all of the accounts he had carefully kept for the last month, to prove that the money we were investing was being spent wisely.
Does this have any direct impact on international trade? Of course not. Did it make that society stronger? Did it make the economy stronger? Did it increase the stability and longterm prospects of the nation? Of course it did. So I believe we should all be thinking about what more we can do on the indigenous economic development issues.
The President of Colombia is here. I've asked the Congress to pass a very ambitious program to try to help Colombia deal with the narcotraffickers and the guerrillas and all the problems that he faces—perhaps the oldest democracy in Latin America. But one part of it is for economic development. It is one thing to tell people they should stop growing crops that can be turned into drugs that can kill our children, and quite another to tell people, if you do this, by the way, here's a way to support your children.
And so I think that we can never lose sight of the fact that if we want to build an integrated economy with more and more trade, we have to build an economy from the grassroots up in places that want to have a balanced, stable society.
The fourth point I would make is that developed and developing countries alike must ensure that the benefits of trade flow widely to workers and families within our nations. Industrialized nations must see that the poor and those hard hit by changes are not left behind. And all nations need to ensure that workers have access to lifelong learning benefits, they can move between jobs without being unemployed for too long and without having their standard of living dropped.
We have to work with corporate leaders to spur investment also in the people and places that have been left behind. We have to find the new markets within our own Nation. For example, I will tell you something that might surprise many of you. The national unemployment rate in the United States is 4.1 percent. On many of our Native American Indian reservations, the unemployment rate is about 70 percent. In isolated rural areas in America, the unemployment rate is sometimes 2, 3, 4 times as high as the national average. So we have not figured out how to solve this. When you have these eyesores in a country, when the development is not even, they can easily become the symbols with which those who do not want us to open our markets more and build a more integrated world can use to defeat our larger designs, even if they're right.
And as I said to the American people in Congress a couple of nights ago, we in the United States, I think, have a terrifically heavy responsibility to reach out to our poor communities, because we've never had an expansion this long, and if we can't help our people now, we will never get around to it. I am convinced that even though this has nothing directly to do with trade, if we succeed, we will build more support for a more integrated global economy.
Leaders of developing nations have their responsibilities as well, to narrow the gap between rich and poor by ensuring that government institutions are open and accountable, honest and effective, so they can get foreign investment, have widely-shared growth, uproot corruption, and solve social problems. There is a limit to what wealthy nations can do for people who will not take the necessary steps to make their own societies work. Even in this heyday of global free enterprise, many people suffer not because their governments are too strong but because their governments are too weak.
Fifth, since globalization is about more than economics, our interdependence requires us to find ways to meet the challenges of advancing our values without promoting protectionism or undermining open trade. I know that the words ""labor and environment"" are heard with suspicion in the developing world when they are uttered by people from the developed world. I understand that these words are code for ""rich-country protectionism.""
So let me be as clear as possible on this. We shouldn't do anything to stunt the economic growth and development of any developing nation. I have never asked any developing nation, and never will, to give up a more prosperous future. But in today's world, developing countries can achieve growth without making some of the mistakes most developed countries made on worker protection and the environment as we were on our path to industrialization. Why is that? Why can they get richer without doing the same things we did? And since, when countries get richer, they lift labor standards and clean up the environment, why do we care? I think there are two answers to that.
First, the reason they can do it is that the new economy has produced scientific and technological advances that absolutely disprove the old ideas about growth. It is actually now possible to grow an economy faster, for example, with a sensible environmental policy and by keeping your kids in school instead of at work, so that you build more brainpower to have more rapid, more long-term, more balanced growth.
Secondly, we all have an interest particularly in the environmental issue, because of global warming, because of greenhouse gas emissions, and because it takes somewhere between 50 and 100 years for those emissions to go away out of our larger atmosphere. So if there is a way for us to find a path of development that improves, rather than aggravates, the difficulties we have with climate change today by reducing rather than increasing greenhouse gases, we are all obligated to do it.
That is why, after the Kyoto Protocols, I recommended to all the advanced nations that we engage in emissions trading and vigorous investment of new technologies in developing countries, with an absolute commitment to them that we would not ask them to slow their economic growth.
We will see within the next few years automobiles on the streets all over the world that routinely get somewhere between 70 and 90 miles a gallon. In South America, many countries run on ethanol instead of gasoline. The big problem is that the conversion is not very good; it takes about 7 gallons of gasoline to make 8 gallons of ethanol. Within a matter of a couple of years, scientists almost certainly will unlock the chemical block that will enable us to produce 8 gallons of fuel from farm products or grasses or even farm waste like rice hulls, for 1 gallon of gasoline. When that happens, you will see people driving cars that effectively are getting 400 or 500 miles to the gallon of gasoline.
These things are before us. All these technologies should be disseminated as widely as possible, as quickly as possible, so that no nation gives up any growth to be a responsible environmental partner in the world.
And on the human development side, I will say again, the globalized economy prizes human development above all else. It is in the longterm and the short-term interests of developing countries not to abuse their workers and to keep their children in school.
Now, do we have all the answers to this? No, partly because the circumstances and the possibility, even for trade engagement, from nation to nation vary so much; but partly because we don't have more forums like this within which we can seek common understandings on worker rights, the environment, and other contentious issues.
We have suggested that the Committee on Trade and the Environment be invited to examine the environmental applications of WTO negotiations in sessions where developing countries form the majority. We cannot improve cooperation and mutual understanding unless we talk about it. That is our motivation—that is our only motivation in seeking to open a discussion about the connections between labor and trade and development, in the form of a new WTO working group.
And I will say this again, the consequence of running away from an open dialog on a profoundly important issue will be—it won't be more trade; it'll be more protection. The consequence of opening up a dialog and dealing honestly with these issues will show that in the new economy, we can have more growth and more trade with better treatment for people in the workplace and more sensible environmental policies. I believe that. You have to decide if you believe that.
My experience in life—and I'm not as young as I used to be—let me just say, at Thanksgiving a 6-year-old daughter of a friend of mine asked me how old I was. She looked up at me and she said, ""How old are you, anyway?"" And I said, ""I'm 53."" She said, ""That's a lot."" [Laughter]
Well, it looks younger every day to me. But I have lived long enough to know this: In the words of that slogan that people my daughter's age always use, denial is not just a river in Egypt. [Laughter] And the more we hunker down and refuse to devote time systematically to discussing these issues and letting people express their honest opinion, the more we are going to fuel the fires of protectionism, not put them out. We have to make some institutional accommodation to the fact that this is a part of the debate surrounding globalization.
Now, I feel the same way about labor standards. And there is a win-win situation here. Let me just give you one example. We had a pilot program through our Agency for International Development, working with the garment industry in Bangladesh to take children out of factories and put them back in schools. The program got kids to learn and actually boosted garment exports and gave jobs to adults who would otherwise not have had them.
We can do more of this if we lower the rhetoric and focus more on results. Common ground means asking workers in developed countries to think about the future of workers in Asia, Africa, or Latin America. It means governments finding the courage to rise above short-term political interest. It means corporations taking responsibility for the effects of their actions, whether they're in an African delta or a New York highrise. It means a new, more active idea of corporate responsibility, stepping up to the plate to pay for vaccines or educate a new generation of workers in another country as a part of the globalization economic strategy.
Finally, let me say that the lessons from our history are clear: We will—we must—support the rules-based system we have, the WTO, even as we seek to reform and strengthen it.
I think those who heard a wakeup call on the streets of Seattle got the right message. But those who say that we should freeze or disband the WTO are dead wrong. Since World War II, there have been eight separate rounds of multilateral trade negotiations, hundreds of trade agreements signed. What's happened? Global trade has increased fifteenfold, contributing to the most rapid, sustained, and, yes, widely shared growth ever recorded.
There is no substitute for the confidence and credibility the WTO lends to the process of expanding trade based on rules. There's no substitute for the temporary relief WTO offers national economies, especially against unfair trade and abrupt surges in imports. And there is no substitute for WTO's authority in resolving disputes, which commands the respect of all member nations. If we expect public support for the WTO, though—I'll get back to my main point—we've got to get out of denial of what's happening now.
If we expect the public to support the WTO the way I do—and I think almost all of you do—we have to let the public see what we're doing. We have to make more documents available, faster. We have to open dispute panel hearings to the public. We have to allow organizations and individuals to panel their views in a formal way. And we all have to play by the rules and abide by the WTO decisions, whether we win or whether we lose.
Let me be clear. I do not agree with those who say we should halt the work of the WTO or postpone a new trade round. But I do not agree with those who view with contempt the new forces seeking to be heard in the global dialog. Globalization is empowering people with information, everywhere.
One of the most interesting things I did on my trip to China was visit an Internet cafe. The more people know, the more opinions they're going to have; the more democracy spreads—and keep in mind, more than half the world now lives under governments of their own choosing—the more people are going to believe that they should be the masters of their own fate. They will not be denied access. Trade can no longer be the private province of politicians, CEO's, and trade experts. It is too much a part of the fabric of global interdependence.
I think we have to keep working to strengthen the WTO, to make sure that the international trade rules are as modern as the market itself, to enable commerce to flourish in all sectors of the economy from agriculture to the Internet. I will keep working for a consensus for a new round, to promote development, to expand opportunity, and to boost living standards all around the world. We will show flexibility, and I ask our trading partners to do the same.
But I would like to just close by trying to put this dilemma that you've all been discussing, and that was writ large in the streets of Seattle, in some context. Now, keep in mind, arguably a lot of the demonstrators in Seattle have conflicting objectives themselves, because of the interests that they represented. The thing they had in common was, they felt that they had no voice in a world that is changing very rapidly. So I want to make two observations in closing.
Number one, we should stop denying that there is in many places an increase in inequality, and we should instead start explaining why it has happened and what we can do about it. Every time a national economy has seen a major change in paradigm, in the beginning of the new economy those that are well-positioned reap great gains; those that are uprooted but not well-positioned tend to suffer an increase in inequality.
In the United States, when our economy, the center of our economy moved from farm to factory 100 years ago—and many people left the farm and came to live in our cities; and many people from your countries came to our shores and were living in unbelievably cramped conditions in tenement houses in New York City and elsewhere, working long hours, breathing dirty air—there was a big increase in inequality, even though there was an increase in wealth, in the beginning. Why? Because some people were well-positioned to take advantage of the new economy, and some people weren't.
But then political and social organizations began to develop the institutions which would intermediate these inequalities. And the economy itself began to mature and disperse the benefits more broadly, and inequality went down. When we saw, beginning about 20 years ago in most advanced economies, a shift from the industrial economy to the digital economy, in many places there was an increase in inequality. In our country, we had a 25-year increase in inequality, which seems to have halted and been reversed only in the last 2 to 3 years.
So a part of this is the change in the paradigm of the global economy which puts a huge, huge, huge premium on education, skills, and access to information technology, which is even more burdensome to developing economies seeking to come to grips with these challenges.
Now, having said that, it should be obvious to all that the last thing in the world we want to do is to make the global economy less integrated, because that will only slow the transition to the digital economy in the poorest countries or in the poorest neighborhoods of the wealthy countries.
The answer is to look at what happened in the transition from the agricultural economy to the industrial economy, develop a 21st century version of that, and get it done much, much faster—not to run to the past but not to deny the present.
The second point I'd like to make is this. We have a well-developed WTO for dealing with the trade issues. We don't have very well-developed institutions for dealing with the social issues, the environmental issues, the labor issues, and no forum within which they can all be integrated. That's why people are in the streets; they don't have any place to come in and say, ""Okay, here's what I think, and here's the contribution I have. Here's the beef I have. How are we going to work all this out?""
That's why you're all here talking about it. That's why you've got a record crowd here. And we all know this intuitively. So I think if I could offer any advice, there are—there's thousands of times more experience and knowledge about all these things in this room than I have in my head. But I do understand a little bit about human nature and a little bit about the emerging process of freedom and democracy. We have got to find ways for these matters to be dealt with that the people who care about them believe are legitimate. And we cannot pretend that globalization is just about economics and it's over here, and all these other things are very nice and we will be very happy to see somebody over here somewhere talk about them. You don't live your life that way. You don't wake up in the morning and sort of put all these barriers in your head and—you know, it's all integrated.
It's like I say, we've got the Chairman of the Palestinian Authority here. We're working very hard to find a comprehensive peace in the Middle East. We can't find that peace if we say, ""Well, here's what we're going to do on these difficult issues and, oh, by the way, there's economics, but it's over here and it doesn't have anything to do with it."" We have to put all these things together.
So I ask you, help us to find a way, first, to explain to the skeptics and the opponents of what we believe in why there is some increase in inequality as a result of an economic change that is basically wonderful and has the potential, if we make the changes we should, to open possibilities for poor people all over the world that would have been undreamed of even 10 years ago. And second, find a way to let the dissenters have their say and turn them into constructive partners. If you do that, we will continue to integrate the world economically and in terms of political cooperation.
We have got a chance to build a 21st century world that walks away not only from the modern horrors of terrorists and bio- and chemical terrorism and technology but away from ancient racial, religious, and tribal hatred. Growth is at the center of that chance. It gives people hope every day. But the economics must be blended with the other legitimate human concerns. We can do it—not by going back to the past but by going together into the future.
Thank you very much.
World Economic Forum President Klaus Schwab. Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, we have just time for one or two questions. But before raising these issues, Mr. President, I can tell you and the applause has shown you what support you have for your plea for an open, rules-based trading system and for globalization. But at the same time, what we take home and what suddenly will influence our discussions very much over the next days, I think we have—and we are all aware here in this hall—that we have to change our attitudes and that we have to create this human and social dimension to globalization. It's in our own interest. And your speech, I think, will be reminded and will be translated into the necessary action.
Now, Mr. President, just two questions. The first one: In your reference to free trade and the WTO, you didn't mention China. And my question is——
President Clinton. Yes, I did.
President Schwab. You mentioned it?
President Clinton. I did, but I don't have—I speak with an accent, so—[laughter]
President Schwab. No, no. [Laughter]
President Clinton. I did, but I——
President Schwab. The question which I would like to raise is, will you actually rally the support in your country and internationally to get China integrated into the WTO?
President Clinton. I think so. In the United States, in the Congress, there are basically two blocks of people who oppose China's accession to the WTO. There are those who believe we should not do it because even though—everyone has to recognize, if you look at our trade deficit with China, everyone recognizes it's huge, by far the biggest part of our trade deficit. Everyone recognizes that we have kept our markets open to China and that if we had greater access to Chinese markets, it would be a good thing for us. So no one could seriously argue that— the openings from agriculture and for other opportunities are massive, and that it would mean more to the United States than any other country since we buy—we're about 22 percent of the world's economy, and every year we buy between 33 and 40 percent of all China's exports, and we have a major, major trade deficit.
So on the economic argument, the people who are against it say, ""Yes, that may be true, but if you put China in the WTO, it's basically a protectionist country, and then America will never get any real action on labor and environmental standards and all that because China will thwart every reform we want."" That's what people say.
Then, there is another group of people that don't want to vote for it because of the actions the Chinese have taken to try to preserve stability at the expense of freedom. They believe that even if China's economy has grown more open, political crackdowns, crackdowns against the Falun Gong and others have gotten more intense, more open, and that it puts the lie to the argument that integrating China into the international system will lead to a more open, more democratic, more cooperative China. Those are basically the two arguments that will be made.
Those both raise serious issues, but I think it would be a mistake of monumental proportion for the United States not to support China's entry into the WTO. I believe that because, again, my experience is that you're almost 100 percent of the time better off having an old adversary that might be a friend working with you, even when you have more disagreements and you have to stay up a little later at night to reach agreement, than being out there wondering, on the outside wondering what you're doing and being absolutely sure whatever it is, it's not good for them.
So I believe that having them in the WTO will not only pad the economic benefits for the United States and other countries I mentioned but will increase the likelihood of positive change in China and, therefore, stability throughout Asia.
Let me say, you know, China and Russia both are still going through big transitions. The Russian economy is coming back a little better than most people think it is. No one knows what China and Russia will be like 10 years from now for sure, and you can't control it, unless you're Chinese or Russian; but you can control what you do. And I don't know about you, but 10 years from now, whatever happens, I want to know that I did everything I could to increase the chance that they would make good choices, to become good, constructive neighbors and good, constructive partners in the global community.
You know, we don't agree with the Russian policy in Chechnya, but we've gotten rid of 5,000 nuclear weapons, and we got our soldiers working together in the Balkans. So I think the argument—we've got to try to have these big countries integrated, for the same reason we have to keep trying to work with India and with Pakistan to resolve those difficulties and get them fully integrated.
At every turn, we have to ask ourselves— we cannot control what other people do; we can only control what we do. But when all is said and done, if it works out well or it works out poorly, we want to know that we have done everything we possibly could to give people a chance to make good decisions. And that's what drives me, and that's why we're going to do everything we possibly can—under the leadership of Secretary Daley, who's going to coordinate our efforts to implement the agreement that our Trade Ambassador, Charlene Barshefsky, negotiated—we're going to try everything we can to get China permanent trading status so we can support their entering the WTO. And my guess is that we'll do it. But it's going to be a big fight, and you can watch it with interest and, I hope, with support. Thank you.
President Schwab. Mr. President, you mentioned debt relief in your speech, and you also mentioned it in your State of the Union message. Do you think the G-7 are really doing enough in this respect?
President Clinton. No, I don't. But if we do— I'm trying to focus on doing what we promised to do. And again, let me tell you what the debate is. We had an intense effort, in the last session of Congress, to pass what the Congress was finally, at the end of the session, good enough to do, and do on a bipartisan basis— I want to give credit to the Republicans, as well as the Democrats, who voted for this— to support our forgiving 100 percent of our bilateral debt for the poorest countries. And we're going to have another intense debate to support our contributions to the multilateral debt reduction effort, which is even more important.
The debate at home—basically, the people who are against this are old-fashioned conservatives who think when people borrow money they ought to pay it back, and if you forgive their debt, well, then, no one else will ever loan them money, because they'll think they'll have to forgive their debt, too. There's something to that, by the way. There's something to that. In other words, when we get into negotiations of whether debt should be rescheduled or totally forgiven, there are many times—when I have confidence in the leader of a country and I know they're going in the right direction, I would almost always rather forgive it, assuming I could get the support in Congress to do so.
But we do have to be sensitive to the way the world investor community views all these things, so that when all is said and done, countries that genuinely will have to continue to borrow money can get the money they need. But with that caveat, I favor doing more and more than the Cologne debt initiative. But my experience is, we do these things on a step-by-step basis. We already have broadened the Cologne debt initiative, and we're going to broaden it again. And I think if we get the Cologne debt initiative done and it works and people see that it works, then we can do more.
But it is really—it is quite pointless, it seems to me, to keep these poor countries trapped in debt. They're having to make debt service payments, which means that they can't educate their children, they can't deal with their health care problems, they can't grow their economy, and therefore they can't make any money to pay their debts off anyway. I mean, it's a totally self-defeating policy we've got now.
So I would like to see us do as much as possible, but at the same time, I want to remind you of another point I made. A lot of countries suffer not because they have governments that are too strong; they suffer because they have governments that are too weak. So we have to keep trying to build the governance capacity for countries so, when they get their debt relief, then they can go forward and succeed. So I don't think you should forget about that, either.
All of us have a real obligation to try to help build capacity so our friends, when they get the relief, can make the most of it.
President Schwab. Mr. President, to conclude our session, you have in front of you the 1,000 most influential business leaders. What would be your single most important wish towards them at this moment?
President Clinton. My most important wish is that the global business community could adopt a shared vision for the next 10 to 20 years about what you want the world to look like, and then go about trying to create it in ways that actually enhance your business, but do so in a way that helps other people as well.
I think the factor about globalization that tends to be underappreciated is, it will only work if we understand it genuinely means interdependence. It means interdependence, which means we can—none of us who are fortunate can any longer help ourselves unless we are prepared to help our neighbors. And we need a more unifying, more inclusive vision. Once you know where you're going, it's a lot easier to decide what steps to take to get there. If you don't know where you're going, you can work like crazy, and you would be walking in the wrong direction. That's why I think this forum is so important.
You need to decide. The business community needs to decide. You may not agree with anything I said up here today. But you have to decide whether you really agree that the WTO is not just the province for you and me and the trade experts. You have to decide whether you really agree that globalization is about more than markets alone. You have to decide whether you really agree that free markets—even in an age of free markets, you need confident, strong, efficient government. You have to decide whether you really agree that it would be a good thing to get the debt off these countries' shoulders if you knew and could require that the money saved would go into educating children and not building weapons of destruction. Because if you decide those things, you can influence not only the decisions of your own government but how all these international bodies, including the WTO, work.
So the reason I came all the way over here on precious little sleep, which probably undermined my ability to communicate today, is that collectively, you can change the world. And what you are doing here is a mirror image of what people are doing all over the world. This is a new network.
But don't leave the little guys out. You know, I come from a little town in Arkansas. I was born in a town of 6,000 people, in a State that's had an income just about half the national average. I've got a cousin who lives in Arkansas. He's a small-business man—he works for a small business—who two or three times a week plays chess on the Internet with a guy in Australia. Now, they've got to work out the times; how they do that, I don't know. But the point I want to make to you is, he thinks he knows as much about his life and his interests and how he relates to the Internet and the world as I do. He thinks he knows just as much about his interests as his President does, who happens to be his cousin.
So we need these networks. And you are in an unbelievably unique position. So my one wish for you—you might think I'd say China or this or that and the other—it's nothing specific: Develop a shared vision. When good people with great energy have shared vision, all the rest works out.
Thank you very much.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-world-economic-forum-and-question-and-answer-session-davos-switzerland
Bill Clinton,"February 14, 2000",Interview With Wolf Blitzer on CNN.com,"2000 Presidential Election
Mr. Blitzer. Thank you very much, Lou. We are in the Oval Office here with President Clinton. Mr. Clinton, thank you so much for doing this historic, first-ever on-line news interview with CNN.com.
I just want to set the scene for you and for our audience. This is not only being put forward on CNN.com and other Internet users, but also it will be seen simultaneously on CNN and CNN International. Fifteen minutes after we're completed, there will be an on-line video that people will be able to see, whenever, if they missed it. There will also be a transcript. They will be able to stream and see this as it goes on, on the Internet. So it's a historic moment for the new technology.
I know you've been fascinated by this, so let's get right at it. We have some E-mail questions. First one from Frank Williams in Tinley Park, Illinois: Mr. President, understandably, you're supporting the Presidential candidacy of Vice President Al Gore. But please share your personal political opinions of Senator John McCain and Governor George W. Bush.
The President. I think I should pass on that. I think—I've tried to stay out of this Presidential election. I'm not a candidate, and I don't think any headlines that I make should interfere with the ability of Senator McCain or Governor Bush to make their point. They're going to have an election in South Carolina, and then they'll go on to other States. And I think that—and at some point it might become appropriate for me to say something, maybe at the Democratic Convention or something, or if they make a specific statement about my administration or my record.
But I really believe that the American people—this is their year, their time. And I am going to vote for the Vice President, and I do support him, because I think he's been the best Vice President in our history by far. And I think he's got a good program for the American people, and I know him to be a good man who will make good decisions.
But I just don't think I should get in the middle of this Presidential race. It only interferes with the voters' ability to draw their own conclusions. And I trust them; they almost always get it right.
Mr. Blitzer. But you do know Senator McCain and Governor Bush?
The President. Sure.
Mr. Blitzer. You've met them, and you have your own opinions of both of them.
The President. I do, and I follow this campaign closely. I'm interested. It's the first time in over 20 years when I've just been an onlooker, so it's been fascinating to me as a citizen. But I don't think that I should say anything right now. And I don't mean to dodge the gentleman's question, but I just think that anything I do would only complicate their lives. And they're making their case to the people, and they're arguing with each other as they should be. And that's the way it ought to be done right now.
Hillary Clinton's Senate Campaign
Mr. Blitzer. All right, we have another Email question from Peggy Brown: Do you find it difficult, Mr. President, watching, listening to criticisms of the First Lady as she attempts to capture the Senate seat in New York?
The President. Sure. I mean, of course, I do. I now know how she felt all those years. You know, I love her very much, and I think—I know her better than anybody else, and I believe she'd be a great public official. And I hope the people of New York will put her to work. But if she's criticized, particularly if somebody says something I know is flatout wrong, it drives me nuts. I want to be able to say, ""Gosh, I wish I could answer that one.""
Middle East Peace Process
Mr. Blitzer. All right. We have a chat room that's going on even as we speak right now. There's a question from one person: Are you optimistic, Mr. President, about the future for Middle East peace?
The President. Yes, I am. This is—we're in a little tough patch right now, because a lot of things are going on in the Middle East, the trouble in Lebanon right now. And we're down to the last strokes, if you will. We're down to the hard decisions. But I believe it is so clearly in the interests of the long-term security of Israel and the long-term interests of the Palestinians and the Syrians and the Lebanese to have a comprehensive peace. And I think we're so close on the substance that I am optimistic.
Now, it will require courage. And it will require courage not just by the leaders, but the people of those countries have to recognize that you cannot make peace unless you're willing to give as well as to get. But they ought to do it, and they ought to do it sooner rather than later. I think that the longer you delay something like this, when you have a moment of opportunity, the more you put it at risk. But I am basically optimistic.
Mr. Blitzer. You've invested a lot of your personal time and energy in the Israeli-Palestinian and the Israeli-Syrian peace process. Is it time for you, once again, to personally get involved and bring the parties together, do something to make sure this opportunity is not lost?
The President. Well, I am personally involved, even when I'm not in a public way. I'm always on the phone, always working this issue. But I think that there will have to be some forward progress here in the next few weeks, and I'll do whatever I can to facilitate it in whatever way I can. But beyond that, I don't want to say anything right now. We're working it, and the parties are working it.
Internet Security
Mr. Blitzer. Okay. Let's take another question from an E-mail that we received: Do you think, Mr. President, the Federal Government could do more for Internet security? I know you have a big conference, a big meeting coming up here at the White House tomorrow to deal with this sensitive issue, especially given the hacker problem that we saw in the last few weeks.
The President. Well, the short answer to that is, we probably can. And I'm bringing in a group of people to meet with me tomorrow, a lot of people from the high-tech community and from all our Government agencies. These denial-of-service attacks are obviously very disturbing, and I think there is a way that we can clearly promote security.
I think it's important that the American people not overreact to this. That is, we're into a whole new world with the Internet, and whenever we sort of cross another plateau in our development, there are those who seek to take advantage of it. So this is a replay of things that have happened throughout our history, and we'll figure out how to do it and go forward.
But I think on balance, no one could dispute what a great thing the Internet has been for our country and for the world. There are now over 200 million people that use it every day, about half of them here in the United States. And we just need to keep pushing it.
National Economy
Mr. Blitzer. And we're using it right now. Let's take another question from our chat room, from our CNN.com chat room: Mr. President, how will you advise Vice President Gore to keep this economy growing?
The President. Well, I think he's got a pretty good idea because he's been here with us and has been part of all the decisions that have been made the last 7 years. But if you look at where we are, the question is—we have the longest economic expansion in history; how do we keep it going?
I think we need to remember the fundamentals. We need to keep the debt being paid down, because that allows people in the private sector to borrow money not only to invest in new businesses or in their existing business but also to purchase things. So the continuing debt repayment is important. Keeping our markets open, to make us competitive and keep inflation down, is important. Investing in science and technology and research and in education and training and closing the digital divide to make sure access to the Internet is available to all Americans, those are the kinds of things that will keep this economy going.
Especially, I would say, we have both the moral obligation and an economic opportunity by increasing investment in the areas which have been not so helped by the economic recovery, in the Indian reservations, the inner-city communities, the rural communities where there haven't been a lot of new jobs. If you get growth there, it is by definition noninflationary, because you get—they haven't had much. So you can lower the unemployment rate there, and you create new businesses, new employees, and new consumers at the same time.
Mr. Blitzer. Mr. President, there's another Email question that we have: How would you respond to arguments that you personally have had very little to do with the economic boom that the country has experienced during your administration?
The President. Well, I would respond by asking them to remember what it was like before we announced and implemented our deficit reduction plan and remember what a direct impact that had on interest rates, on investment, and on the stock market.
The American people deserve the lion's share of the credit. The high-tech community—we're part of it today—they deserve a lot of the credit. High-technology companies employ only 8 percent of our people; they're responsible for 30 percent of our growth. The companies that restructured in the eighties deserve a lot of credit. Everybody who's kept our markets open, guaranteeing low inflation and more competition, they deserve a lot of credit.
But nonetheless, we had a completely jobless recovery, what some people called a ""triple dip"" economy, until we finally said we're going to do something about this deficit. And when we did it, it was like breaking a dam, and the interest rates came down, and people started being able to get money and investing at an unprecedented rate, and the stock market started its upward march.
So I think the critical things we did—we had a good fiscal policy; we had a good policy on the markets; and we had a good policy on investing in technology and in people and education and training. And I don't think there's any question that had we not taken that first big bite out of the deficit, then the growth would have been much slower than it has been.
Mr. Blitzer. Okay. I guess the person asking this question was also suggesting that the Republicans in Congress, Alan Greenspan, and the Internet economy, all of that combined to help you.
The President. And I agree with that. I agree. I think Chairman Greenspan did a good job. The main thing he's done, that I think he deserves a lot of credit for, is that he has been able to look at the evidence of the new economy and act on the evidence, instead of what you might call the old theology. Otherwise, he could have killed this recovery by raising interest rates too much too frequently in the past.
I think the Republicans in Congress—not a one of them voted for the economic plan in '93. But we did have a bipartisan majority in both Houses in '97 for the Balanced Budget Act, which continued what we were doing, and they deserve credit for that. And I have never— I try never to deny anybody else credit. This is an American achievement, not just mine. But if we hadn't taken that first big bite out of the deficit, I don't think we'd be where we are today.
Situation in Chechnya
Mr. Blitzer. All right, Mr. President, we have another question, an E-mail question: Why are the Western nations—why have they not done enough for Chechnya like they did for Kosovo?
The President. Well, first of all, I don't think the situations are parallel. But I think the Western nations have spoken out against the excesses. We believe—I think I speak for all the Western leaders; I certainly will speak for myself—that Russia had a right to take on the paramilitary forces who were practicing terrorist tactics, but that it was a mistake to adopt the position that, in effect, ruled out negotiations with the elected officials in Kosovo, who weren't part of the terrorism, and to adopt tactics that cause a lot of civilian losses without any kind of corresponding gain. So I think we've been pretty clear about that. That's different from what happened in Kosovo, where Milosevic basically ran the whole country out based on their ethnic origin and had no intention of letting them come back until he had crushed anybody's ability to say anything.
So I don't think that the situations are parallel. But I think we have spoken out against the excesses in Chechnya and tried to get humanitarian aid in there and will continue to try to help the people of Chechnya and the legitimate political forces there. That's very different from what the paramilitary forces did. They have to bear their share of responsibility for what happened as well. I think some of them actually wanted the Chechnyan civilians attacked because they thought it would help improve their political views.
Russia-U.S. Relations
Mr. Blitzer. Okay, we have a followup question from our chat room. Let me read it to you as it's coming in: How can Americans know that America is really at peace with Russia?
The President. Because we're neither fighting with them nor on the edge of fighting. We've detargeted the nuclear weapons against each other. We are working to secure the nuclear weapons in Russia, to help them destroy nuclear weapons, to help safeguard the materials that remain. And I hope very much that after the next Russian election, we'll be able to make further progress on reducing the nuclear weapons there that we both hold.
Mr. Blitzer. And Vladimir Putin, the Acting President, is he someone that you can deal with?
The President. Based on what I have seen so far, I think that the United States can do business with this man. I think he's obviously highly intelligent; he's highly motivated; he has strong views. We don't agree with him on everything, but what I have seen of him so far indicates to me that he's capable of being a very strong and effective and straightforward leader.
Taxes and the Internet
Mr. Blitzer. All right, let's go back to another issue involving the Internet. This is a question: Mr. President, what role will you play in the debate on taxing Internet commerce?
The President. Well, we've played some role already. I signed a bill last year to have a 3year moratorium on any kind of discriminatory or transactional tax, if you will, on the commerce on the Internet. I don't think that there should be any access or any other kind of discriminatory taxes, from my point of view, ever on the Internet.
The tough question is the whole question of what happens to sales that if they were not on the Internet would be subject to State and local sales tax. And the Governors are trying to work through that. I know Governor Leavitt has taken a particular interest in that, the Governor of Utah. I think that's something that we have to work through because we need—there are whole questions about the need for States to simplify their tax structures, and there are other questions there that have to be resolved. And I think that's going to take some time to resolve.
But I don't think we should have access taxes on the Internet or any other kind of discriminatory taxes, because this is an important part of our economy, and we want it to grow. I think that for the States and the localities, they're going to have to keep working until they work through what the operational problems are.
Mr. Blitzer. Doesn't that discriminate, though, against stores—a bookstore, for example——
The President. Of course it does.
Mr. Blitzer. ——that you have to pay tax——
The President. Absolutely, it does.
Mr. Blitzer. ——but if you go to Amazon.com you don't have to pay taxes?
The President. It does, and that's the argument that the Governors are making and the argument a lot of the merchants are making.
Mr. Blitzer. Well, where's your position on that?
The President. Well, what I'm trying to do is get them together. There are also—the Internet people point out that there are also a lot of complications in the way State taxes are. And they have on their side the weight of Supreme Court law which basically was made from mailorder sales. The same argument was made against mail-order sales. And the prevailing legal position is that if you don't have enough connections to a State, you don't have the obligation to collect and remit the sales tax.
Keep in mind, the sales taxes do—it's just that the seller doesn't have to collect and remit it. So most of the people I know who have Internet businesses are concerned about trying to make sure they get a simplified system, and they know what the drill is. Their main concern, however, is not having access to the Internet itself taxed. And I'm with them on that. And I'm trying to support the process that now exists to resolve the issue of how State taxes, the sales taxes, can best be collected in the way that's not too burdensome on the Internet.
You don't want to burden the Internet, but you don't want to put people who aren't making sales on it out of business. And we've got to find that right balance, and that's what we're working on.
Austria
Mr. Blitzer. We have another question from our chat room, an international question involving the political situation in Austria given the fact that Joerg Haider is now—his party is part of the Austrian Government. Let me read to you the question: What does the United States plan to do to make sure that Austria knows that Nazi sympathy will not be accepted?
The President. Well, I think we've made it quite clear that we do not support any expression of either sympathy with the Nazis in the past or ultranationalist race-based politics, antiimmigrant politics in the future. That, I think, is equally important here. And we've also tried to stay pretty close to where the European Union has been because, after all, Austria is a part of Europe, and they've been very tough in condemning what the Austrians have done here. So I think we're on the right track.
There is a delicate balance, however. You know, Austria is a democracy; this man's party got a certain percentage of the vote. He did it based on appeals that went well beyond a narrow race-based appeal. And we don't want to say or do anything that builds his support even further. But I think it ought to be clear to every Austrian citizen that we in the United States do not approve of his political program or his excessive rhetoric.
Iran-U.S. Relations
Mr. Blitzer. Let's stay overseas. We have another E-mail question about U.S.-Iranian relations: I'd like to know, Mr. President, your view on the recent developments of Iranian-American relations as we, the Iranian youth, are really anxiously following political developments between the two countries and no doubt willing to finally see a healthy and mutually respectful relationship between the two.
The President. Well, that's what I want. You know, I said several weeks ago now, maybe a few months ago, that the United States had not been entirely blameless in the past in our relationships with Iran, and that we wanted a good relationship with Iran, that we did not support and did not condone anyone who would support terrorist actions, and that we had some difficulties with Iran, but we were viewing with interest affairs within Iran. We wanted the Iranian people to have a good democracy. We like to see these elections, and we want to be supportive of better relationships if we can work them out on ways that are mutually agreeable.
I think that one of the best things we could do for the long-term peace and health of the Middle East and, indeed, much of the rest of the world, is to have a constructive partnership with Iran. And I'm still hoping that that can materialize. A lot of that is now in the hands of the Iranian people and their elections and also the leaders of Iran. Some of them don't want that, but I think some of them may want that. And I think it's important that the genuine reformers there not be, in effect, weakened because of their willingness to at least talk to us, because I think the United States should always remain open to a constructive dialog to people of good will. And I think that the estrangement between these two countries is not a good thing. I think it would be better if we could have a relationship.
Mr. Blitzer. As you know, Mr. President, in this regard, 13 Iranian Jews were accused of spying, and they're being held. Is this an irritant in this? What do you want the Iranian Government to do on that front?
The President. Well, I have been assured by the Israelis that they were not spies. And I've done quite a bit of work on it. I'm very, very concerned about this, because people cannot— it is an irritant. The American Jewish community is very, very concerned about it, and we've done a lot of work on it. And I'm hopeful that justice will be done there and that no one will be punished for being a spy who isn't. That's not a good thing to do. And that, obviously, is a real—it's one of the sticking points.
But I think that there are other people of good will who the Iranians recognize are their friends, who want better relationships with them, who have also talked to them about this, and I'm hoping that it will be worked out in a satisfactory manner.
Media Mergers
Mr. Blitzer. Okay, Mr. President, I think we have another question from our chat room. Let's see what it is: How can we keep the media giants from squashing the little guy? I guess they might be referring to the recent merger of our own CNN-Time Warner-AOL. What's your answer to that?
The President. Well, I think the main things to me are—there are two sets of little guys, I guess. The one thing is you don't want to— and Steve Case has talked about this for many years, himself——
Mr. Blitzer. He's the chairman of AOL.
The President. The chairman of AOL—that it's important not to have access choked off. We want all these—if these mergers go through, we want them to lead to greater access to greater options to consumers at more affordable prices. Then the second thing is, you want other competitors to be able to get into the game. That's what all the big controversy was over the antitrust suit involving Microsoft. And that's handled in the Justice Department, strictly apart from the White House, so we had no role in that one way or the other.
And without expressing an opinion on that case one way or the other, I think what I favor is an American economy where people who have good ideas and new messages they want to get out ought to have some way to do that, if they can generate a following. So that's what needs to be monitored here.
Some of this amalgamation I think is inevitable, given the possible synergy that could exist, for example, between a company like AOL and Time Warner, with all of its myriad publications and programs and networks. But you've got to have—there has to be some room for people who want to compete, and then there has to be a guarantee that consumers will not be choked off and their prices hiked and, in fact, they will have more access to more programs at more affordable prices. And I think those are the touchstones that ought to guide Government policy.
Small Business
Mr. Blitzer. All right. Let's take another question from our chat room, CNN.com chat room: What will the current and future administrations do to keep small business alive? Sort of related to the last question.
The President. One of the things that I'm very proud of about this economy—and again, I don't take total credit for this; this is part of our prosperity—but in every year I've been President, we've set a new record for starting small businesses—every single year.
I think that the Small Business Administration has an important role to play. I think that we have dramatically increased the number of small business loans that we finance, and we've concentrated on women and minorities, others who have been traditionally denied credit.
We have promoted aggressively for the first time what we call community development financial institutions, where we put Federal money into banks to try to help them make small loans to people who never could have gotten credit before. Just as we do around the world, we're now doing that here. And that's helping.
We've tried to continue to minimize the burden of Government regulations on small business. And I think that's important—to keep an entrepreneurial environment in America, so people can get access to venture capital if they've got an idea and start it.
So I think having the right conditions and then having specific access to capital and technical support through the Small Business Administration and the community financial institutions—that's the best thing we can do for small business.
President's Legacy
Mr. Blitzer. We have another question about the future in our chat room: What will the history books say about the Clinton Presidency?
The President. Well, I'm not sure, because that's for the historians to decide. But I think they will say, among other things, that we had a—we came into office with a different approach that was attuned better to the changes that were going on in the economy, in the society and in the world, and that we helped America get through this enormous period of change and transition—in the metaphor I use, to build our bridge to the 21st century—and that our country was stronger when we finished than it was when we began. I hope that's what they'll say, and I believe they will.
President's Future Plans
Mr. Blitzer. All right, we have a follow-up question from our chat room. Let's take a look at that one: Mr. President, what are you going to do when you leave office? Which is now less than a year away. You probably—are you counting the days?
The President. No, not in a negative way. I mean, I'm not eager for them to be over. In fact, one of the problems I have is, I want to work even harder now to try to get as much done as I can.
When I leave, I'm going to establish a library and a public policy center.
Mr. Blitzer. That will be in Little Rock.
The President. And that will take a couple years to do. And I'm going to try to maintain a high level of activity in the areas that I'm particularly interested in. I've spent a lot of my life working on reconciliation of people across racial, religious, and other lines. I'm very interested in using the power of technology, like what we're doing now, to help poor countries and poor areas overcome what would ordinarily take years in economic development and education.
I'm very interested in continuing my work to try to convince Americans and the rest of the world that we can beat global warming without shutting down the economy, that it's no longer necessary to use more greenhouse gases to grow economically. I'm very interested in promoting the concept of public service among young people and trying to get more young Americans to take some time off to serve in our National Government or the State and local government. Those are four things I'll do.
Basically, I want to try to be a good citizen. America's given me a lot, and more than I could have ever dreamed. I've loved being President. And I feel that I've acquired a certain level of experience and knowledge, that I owe that to my country. And along the way, I hope to write a few books and have a little fun, too. And I hope I'll be a member of the Senate spouses club. I'm going to do my best to support my wife in every way I can.
But I just want to be a good citizen. I want to try to put what I've learned in a lifetime to use in a way that benefits the people of America and others around the world who I care about.
Mr. Blitzer. And you'll commute between Chappaqua, New York, and Little Rock, sort of?
The President. Yes, I'll spend some time in Little Rock for the next couple of years, you know, like I said, getting the facility up. And I'll spend some time with Hillary, as much as I possibly can, in New York. And then I'll probably travel some. And I hope we'll be able to travel some together. It depends on what happens in the next year.
But I'm really looking forward to it. I love this job. I don't know if I'll ever do anything again that I love the work as much as I love this. John Kennedy described it well. He said, basically, it challenges all your abilities. It challenges your mind, your emotions, even your physical strength. But I think that I can do a lot of things that will help other people when I leave here, and I'm going to do my best to do that.
President's Favorite Websites
Mr. Blitzer. All right, Mr. President, if you'll take a look at our chat room, the people who are participating in the CNN.com chat, they're participating in huge numbers right now. Let's take another question, though, from an E-mail person named Seth. He says this: Mr. President, I have heard that you are an avid web surfer and on-line shopper. What are your favorite websites?
The President. Well, I wouldn't say I am avid. I did do some Christmas shopping for the first time on-line this year, though. And I even— I bought some things from the Native American craftspeople up in South Dakota, at Pine Ridge, which was really interesting to me.
But I love books, so I like Amazon.com. And I'm fascinated by eBay, because I like to swap and trade, and it reminds me of the old kind of farmer's markets and town markets I used to visit when I started out in politics in Arkansas so many years ago. I think the whole concept of people being able to get on-line and sort of trade with each other, and almost barter, is utterly fascinating to me.
Issues of the New Millennium
Mr. Blitzer. All right, we have another question, Mr. President. We only have a little time left. Let's take this from the chat room: Mr. President, what is the biggest issue facing Americans in the new millennium?
The President. Well, I think the most important thing that we have to do is to make up our minds that we are actually going to build a more united country out of our diversity and out of our groundbreaking technology and advances in science and technology. That is, I think that if you look around the world today, the biggest problems seem to be rooted in racial, ethnic, religious strife. If you look at America and how well we fit with a positive vision of the 21st century world and you look at the continuing problems we've had here, with these hate crimes, for example, the most important thing we could do is get our minds right and get our spirits right and realize that we have to learn to live with people who are different from us. We have to learn to keep our conflicts with them within proper bounds, so that our common goals override the differences between us.
If we build one America, that's the most important thing. The American people are so innovative, so creative, and we're so well-positioned for the future, everything else will work out. But if we allow ourselves to fall into these deep divisions over—including political ones—differences of opinion are healthy; demonization is destructive and self-indulgent. And that's basically what we've got to work on.
If we can keep working together enough in creative tension, then everything else will work out. I'm confident of it.
Social Security
Mr. Blitzer. All right, Mr. President. We have time for one final question. It's from Wolf in Washington, DC—that would be me, by prerogative, as the moderator of this discussion, this on-line interview we're having: You know the Republicans today in the House of Representatives are pushing legislation that would remove the limits, ease the limits on Social Security recipients as far as their earnings after they reach 65 until 70—a very sensitive subject, affects a lot of people watching right now, how much money they could earn and still be eligible for Social Security. Will you work with the Republicans, support them in eliminating those caps on earnings?
The President. Absolutely. I'm thrilled by this. I hope this is just the beginning of a signal from them that they're willing to work on this whole Social Security area.
I think we should lift the earnings limit for two reasons. One is, I don't really think it's fair for people—if you're 65 today in America, your life expectancy is 83. And you want to be alert; you want to be physically strong. And we know as people stay more active, they're going to live better, not just longer. So I don't think we should penalize them.
Secondly, I think as the baby boomers retire, it's going to be important to have a higher percentage of people over 65, if they want to, working. This will be good for our society. I'm strongly in favor of it.
If they will send me a bill—what we call in Washington-speak, a clean bill—that is, doesn't have a lot of other things unrelated to that littered to it—I will be happy to sign it.
Then the second thing I'd like to urge them to do is to think about my proposal to dedicate the interest savings that we get from paying down the debt because of the surplus in the Social Security tax to the Social Security Trust Fund to do two things: Number one, put the life of the Trust Fund out to 2050; that will take care of most of the baby boom generation; and number two, do something about a single woman's poverty on Social Security. Married women's poverty on Social Security, about 5 percent; overall, seniors over 65, under 10 percent now. Single women on Social Security tend to live longer, tend to have less money; their poverty rate is somewhere between 18 and 20 percent.
So I like getting rid of the earnings limitation. It's the right thing to do. Let's just do it. But then let's lengthen the life of the Trust Fund and do something about the poverty rate among women who are retired.
Mr. Blitzer. Mr. President, thank you so much for joining us from the Oval Office. Always, of course, great to be in the Oval Office. And one day when you're not in the Oval Office, you'll probably be excited coming back here as well.
The President. I will be. I'll always be excited to come here. And maybe I'll even get to do a web chat with you afterward.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-wolf-blitzer-cnncom
Bill Clinton,"February 17, 2000",Press Briefing by Jake Siewert and David Leavy,"The James S. Brady Press Briefing Room
1:37 P.M. EST
MR. SIEWERT: I cannot guarantee this will be as exciting as the Russian newscast we've all been enjoying this morning. One announcement, and then we'll start. The President will travel to Philadelphia and New York City next Thursday. He will leave Andrews at 1:30 p.m., travel to Philadelphia, where he will deliver a speech at the University of Pennsylvania, at the Irving Auditorium. And that's going to be an inaugural lecture in a series that I think will be called the Granoff Lecture Series. And I would expect that speech to focus on the new economy.
The President has given an important speech there in 1992, in April of '92, I believe, where he sort of outlined his own economic vision, in contrast to that of the Bush administration, and he will take stock of where we are and talk about the success and where we need to go.
After that, he'll go to New York and he has some fundraising dinners there. I don't have much detail on those, but we'll make that available as we get them.
Q: Are any of them for the First Lady, do you know, or are they for --
MR. SIEWERT: No, they're both DNC fundraisers, and he'll return to D.C. late that night. That's what we expect at the moment, probably getting back around midnight. And we'll post a sign-up today for that trip.
That's all I've got.
Q: Is he going to New York this weekend?
MR. SIEWERT: He doesn't have any plans to, but we'll let you know.
Q: Jake, is he going to do anything Monday -- it's Presidents Day -- does he have any events --
MR. SIEWERT: Not that I'm aware of. At the moment, that's down time. We'll do that in a week ahead, we'll give you any updates. But at the moment, that's a day off for everyone.
Q: Any more WTO meetings this week?
MR. SIEWERT: He had two this week. I know they were trying to schedule one today. I think, with the congressional calendar and the House members leaving town, I think they're going to postpone it until when the House returns.
Q: When they come back the following week?
MR. SIEWERT: Yes.
Q: Jake, there was a report that the President has grown frustrated with the IRA. Is that correct, or how would you characterize the administration --
MR. SIEWERT: I don't know how I'd characterize it. It sounds like a Mr. Leavy question.
MR. LEAVY: Nice jacket, Randy. (Laughter.) Sorry about that.
Q: Do you mean you don't mean it? (Laughter.)
MR. LEAVY: No, it's quite a jacket, Randy. (Laughter.)
I don't think there is any truth to those reports if you are referring to what was in the British press today. I think, as the President said pretty eloquently yesterday, that it is not the time for finger-pointing or recriminations, but a time to get the peace process back on track. We've been working this very, very hard, both at the presidential level and also Mr. Berger and Mr. Steinberg here at the NSC will continue to do that. David Trimble's coming to Washington on Monday. I think Mr. Berger will see him. So we remain engaged and, hopefully, that we can get this back on track and try to seize the moment to implement all aspects of the Good Friday Accord, and, as the people of Northern Ireland and Ireland voted overwhelmingly last year, to try to bring peace to the province.
Q: Can you characterize the Berger meeting? Does he have a message for Trimble?
MR. SIEWERT: No, I think it is just another element of our engagement on the issue. I know Mr. Berger has talked to both Mr. Trimble and Mr. Adams several times over the last few weeks. We have been engaged both with the parties, but also the governments, the Irish and British governments. So this is another meeting in that vein. I don't have any specific agenda items, but I am sure they will talk about where we are in the process.
Q: Are there plans to receive Mr. Adams?
MR. SIEWERT: I would look forward to seeing Sinn Fein leaders in Washington in the near future, but I don't have any specific dates at this point.
Q: Did David Trimble ask for the meeting, or was --
MR. LEAVY: I don't know if we asked him to come or vice versa. I can check on that.
Q: Mr. Ivanov is what -- Sandy's counterpart?
MR. LEAVY: Yes, yes.
Q: Can you talk a little bit about those talks they're having and the significance of them?
MR. LEAVY: Yes. Mr. Ivanov is Sandy's counterpart, roughly, as Mr. Putin's National Security Advisor. Sandy invited him the come over here to address really a broad range of issues, both strategic issues, arms control, nonproliferation, certainly bilateral issues where we agree and disagree -- Chechnya being first and foremost on that. They're meeting today and tomorrow, I think two days of meetings, and at the conclusion of that we can give you a better readout.
Q: Is arms control -- does the President want to achieve another breakthrough on arms control before he leaves?
MR. LEAVY: Well, as you know, we have a pretty comprehensive arms control agenda with Russia. We're pushing hard for the Duma to ratify START II, to lock in what the Senate did several years ago on that piece. We've laid down a framework for START III negotiations. The President and President Yeltsin agreed to that framework back in Helsinki in '97. We're still in the process of talking through that. We'd like to see further reductions, but it's got to be in the overall context of arms control.
Q: While you're up there, what's happening with the Middle East and with the White House involvement?
MR. LEAVY: Nothing new. Nothing new. Is there anything specific that you're referring to?
Q: I mean, is there any movement at all other than a downward spiral?
MR. LEAVY: Well, I'm not sure I would call it a downward spiral. We're at a moment where a comprehensive peace is at hand for Israel; it's been a long-term goal for Israel as well as the United States. Both tracks are at a point where we're going to have to make some very momentous and decisive decisions. We're engaged with both the Israelis, the Palestinians, the Syrians, and we're hopeful that we can push both tracks forward, and we'll continue to do that.
Q: -- on the agreement between the Pope and the PLO? Does the administration take any view of it?
MR. LEAVY: Let me check on that. I certainly think that if the Vatican and the PLO have reduced their tensions that they've had in years past and are able to work together on areas of common concern, that's a good thing. But let me check to see if there's anything more on that.
Q: What kind of indications have you received from the Saudis and the Venezuelans over the oil situation?
MR. LEAVY: None to report.
Q: There has been no communication?
MR. LEAVY: Well, I think as Joe said yesterday, we talk to our allies all the time, but those conversations are better for private, as opposed to public, discussion.
Q: Are you confident there's going to be some kind of movement?
MR. LEAVY: Again, let me stay away from that. I don't think it's useful for us to speculate in public about any discussions that may or may not be taking place.
Q: Any movement to bring George Mitchell back into the Northern Ireland peace process, as the architect of the Good Friday Accords that now seem to be in very grave danger?
MR. LEAVY: Well, I'm not sure I'd characterize it as grave danger. I think all sides are committed to moving forward. There have been some important elements put forward. I think those deserve serious consideration and I think creativity and flexibility are needed as we move forward.
As Senator Mitchell said, we need to break through the decommissioning mind-set on this issue. So we're hopeful that we can get both sides to do that. I'm not aware of his own engagement. I'd refer you to his office, but I haven't heard if he's been talking to the parties. Certainly nothing in a public way.
Q: Is the President going to be asking him to take more --
MR. LEAVY: I haven't heard that.
Q: One more follow-up on Ireland. Is it now the U.S. position that nothing can happen unless the IRA decomissions? We keep going all around on this --
MR. LEAVY: Our view, as we've all said many, many times, and the President yesterday, that all aspects of the Good Friday Accords have to be implemented, including decommissioning. We're obviously at a point where that is the central issue, but there have been some creative positions put forward and we want those positions to be taken hold and debated and looked at. And we're hopeful we can move forward.
I don't want to get into, as I said earlier to Randy's question, a real public discussion on the technical aspects of what a way forward would be. That's not helpful here. So I'll leave it to the parties.
Q: Does the White House have any comment on Greenspan's comments today about interest rates needing to rise to slow the economy?
MR. LEAVY: I'm going to leave that for Mr. Siewert.
Q: David, can you talk just one second about Pakistan? The President laid down some guidelines yesterday on visiting Pakistan. Is there a cutoff by which it's simply logistically not possible to go to Pakistan? Is there -- do you have any head for this?
MR. LEAVY: Yes -- I don't think the President was intending to put any benchmarks or lay down any preconditions for his trip. I don't think he said that. There are some areas of concern that we've been talking to the Pakistanis for sometime -- terrorism, nonproliferation, restoration of democracy. We haven't made a decision on any other stops for the trip. I'm not sure if there's a deadline, per se. I think at some point it becomes logistically more difficult to do that. I haven't heard of a specific cutoff, though, John.
I would just take a step back and I think it is really important for all of you who are going to cover the trip or write about it to look at this as really an important milestone for the United States to go to the region. It will really deepen our engagement with India. It is a really diverse and important country for us, with many, many issues we deal with them on from security, nonproliferation, health, the environment. And this is going to be an opportunity to deepen those relationships, deepen those contacts. And I think the trip stands on its own as is, and I wouldn't look at it through the lens of whether or not we go to Pakistan, but whether we can accomplish the goals we are setting out for the countries we're visiting right now.
Q: The President said he would be willing to mediate or the United States would be willing to mediate on Kashmir between the two. Did anybody take him up on that? Have we heard any nibbles?
MR. LEAVY: I don't think so. I think the President was restating our long-stated policy that we want a peaceful resolution to the issue of Kashmir. It is best done through bilateral channels and bilateral dialogue between the Indians and Pakistanis. If both sides want us to play a role, we would certainly be willing to do that. There hasn't been that kind of request as of yet. I don't think there has been anything since yesterday. So we will continue to hope that both sides can engage each other and try to make progress.
Q: Mr. Talbott and Mr. Steinberg are in China this week. Any readout on their meetings so far? Any sense that there is any tension developing between the two in the run-up to the Taiwanese elections?
MR. LEAVY: No, this is a trip that Secretary Talbott is heading with Mr. Steinberg, Mr. Slocombe of the Defense Department, Joe Rallston, who is the Vice Chair of the Joint Chiefs, who is leaving to go take up his post at NATO. The delegation went both to Tokyo and to Beijing -- important issues with the Japanese in the run-up to the G-8 Summit in Okinawa this year, also general alliance issues with the Japanese. They went on to meet with the leadership in Beijing, again, to talk about broad strategic issues as well as bilateral issues.
I haven't got a readout of exactly what's been on the agenda and what's been talked about. I think they are going to be there through tomorrow and so we can, when they're done, have a little bit more of a readout.
Q: On the Mideast, does the administration think that the unilateral Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon will either help or hinder the Syrian peace talks?
MR. LEAVY: Well, you know, it's an issue for the Israelis to decide. I think we would like to see a withdrawal from Lebanon in the context of an overall peace agreement, one that brings in the Syrians and the Lebanese, but, of course, that's a decision for the parties to make.
It's been tragic over the last several weeks, as we've seen violence escalate there. I think all of us have a tremendous amount of sympathy and grief for the victims of violence, both the Lebanese people, who have undertaken years of pain and destruction, and for certainly the Israelis who have been killed in this. And we have stated very often from these quarters that there should be restraint and all parties who have influence on the region to bring that restraint to bear.
Q: You don't think one way or another -- the administration has no opinion one way or another whether that would help or hinder the process right now?
MR. LEAVY: I can't judge whether that would help or hinder, but, again, our position, though, has always been that if we can get a comprehensive peace that brings in the Syrians and the Lebanese, that would enhance Israel's security, and certainly withdrawal has to be part of that context or should be part of that context.
Q: During his speech today, President Clinton said that Africa probably needs better government and also an end to some of the ethnic tensions that have caused problems on the continent. But, on the other hand, during his opening remarks, he also welcomed President Moi of Kenya, and one of the hallmarks of the Kenyan government is corruption and Mr. Moi political party has also been fomenting tension in the Rift Valley in which over 1,000 people have been killed. Why did he do that? Did that just undercut his message?
MR. LEAVY: I don't think so. And Gayle Smith, who is our senior director for African Affairs, will come out shortly and give you a little bit more of a readout. But one of the key messages for the President, he is going to meet with President Moi after -- he met with him after the speech and he delivered a very stern message about the need for constitutional and economic reforms to move forward. I believe President Moi is scheduled to step down in 2002. And we have made anticorruption a key pillar of our Africa policy, as the President referenced, and he will certainly be delivering that message to President Moi in private.
Q: Do you know what his reaction was --
MR. LEAVY: No. Gayle is going to come out in a couple minutes following us, so she can give you a better readout.
Q: Can we do some domestic questions?
MR. LEAVY: Yes -- do you need me?
Q: Yes, on the Middle East. Can you say that there has been any progress made toward getting the talks restarted between Syria and Israel?
MR. LEAVY: We continue our engagement. I don't have any news to announce today, no.
MR. SIEWERT: I think I've got the question. Having spent a lifetime -- not a lifetime, but some time -- counseling others to avoid commenting on Mr. Greenspan's comments on interest rates, I think I will do the same.
On fiscal policy, we certainly appreciated Mr. Greenspan's comments that he thought the surpluses should be dedicated to debt reduction. And that's exactly what the vast bulk of the President's plan does, is use the surplus to pay down the debt, and that creates a more conducive climate for a good economy.
Q: Jake, Vice President Gore has encouraged senators to vote against Bradley Smith's confirmation. Would the President encourage senators to vote against Bradley Smith, and force the Republicans to come up with a different nominee?
MR. SIEWERT: Well, I think the President pretty much covered that one yesterday. I mean, this is someone --
Q: He didn't say specifically about how he would like to see the senators vote.
MR. SIEWERT: Well, I'll check. I'll check with him. But I don't have anything really to add to what he said yesterday. I mean, he said that the Senate plays an important role in appointments, it plays an important role in confirming those appointments. And at the same time, we respect the Senate's role in selecting appointments, particularly when the majority party of the Senate is charged with selecting Republican nominees.
Q: But a majority supports McCain-Feingold, so you could imagine that a majority could vote down this guy.
MR. SIEWERT: I don't know whether this is -- if this is a test for McCain-Feingold, they're not -- I can't speculate about what the Senate -- how individual senators are going to see this vote. I mean, the President could not have been clearer yesterday that he wants to see an up or down vote on McCain-Feingold, and frankly, we've had some senators who have blocked that for years now, when there is a clear majority for that.
Q: So wait a second -- the President has nominated somebody for a post, but you're not sure if he wants the Senate to confirm that person, or not?
MR. SIEWERT: I mean, the individual question, I'll check on that. But the President said very clearly that he thought that Bradley Smith was a Republican choice for that spot; he does not -- it would not have been his choice. He could not have been clearer. But I don't think he'll be making a lot of phone calls on that one, but I can't imagine that -- I assume the Majority Leader probably will have the votes to approve Mr. Smith.
Q: The aid to Colombia seems to be getting into a lot of flack in Congress. Is the President doing anything about it, just letting the process --
MR. SIEWERT: Dave may want to take that. I know that the appropriations bill is moving forward. I heard the Republican leaders say that they wanted to move very quickly on that. I know that we've had some discussions with the House leadership on putting together that package, and actually, there may be some debate over the size and composition of the supplemental, but actually, I heard some very encouraging -- read some very encouraging words from the House Republican leadership on moving that bill quickly yesterday.
Q: Do you have a time line on the Leahy emergency supplemental?
MR. SIEWERT: It's the same supplemental. We're hoping that they will fold that money into the supplemental. We want to move very quickly on that and make sure that that money is available as soon as possible. And at the same time, we're taking some aggressive measures to follow up on what the President said yesterday. Obviously the governors will be here in two weeks; the President wants to meet with them. But in the shorter-term, we're taking some steps to let the Republican and Democratic governors throughout New England and the Mid-Atlantic know about the measures they can take to make this money available more quickly.
And frankly, there have been some problems in the past, people not aware of their eligibility for this. And we need to do more to increase the awareness of the heating assistance, and we're going to work aggressively with the governors and with the delegations from those states to do that.
Q: Can I follow up on that? What is the mechanism for an ordinary person -- particularly someone who might be afraid of dealing with the government or doesn't speak English?
MR. SIEWERT: Well, it varies from state to state, but these are state-run programs. A lot of times they're administered by not the state itself, but by local government, or sometimes by cooperatives, non-profit cooperatives that work particularly with low-income families. But we're going to have some suggestions. We may have something tomorrow, a little more concrete, about some of the best practices for states to move forward in making their citizens aware of just what they can do to get this money, and how they can move to make that money available more quickly.
But the program is administered by states and the practice of it varies quite significantly.
Q: The $600 million that you're requesting, is that money that you intend to disburse immediately or will that just sort of replenish the coffers --
MR. SIEWERT: It's designed to replenish the coffers. As you know, we've now released about $300 million over the last three weeks to states that have been affected by this crisis. And we will work with Congress on the purpose and use of that money.
Q: The President said yesterday that the $600 million was for the winter and through the summer, for high utility bills that could be experienced in the summer in hotter regions. Is that -- is it fair to conclude from that that he expects high energy prices to last through the summer?
MR. SIEWERT: No, I think that he's just indicating what the LIHEAP fund is designed to do, which is to help in the winter, help low-income families pay their heating bills, and in the summer -- we used it last summer, if you remember, during the heatwave to help low-income families deal with some of the air-conditioning and difficult pressures that they faced during some of the heatwaves during the summer in, I know, Illinois and Texas, and some other places.
Q: There is a newspaper story this morning saying that the Vice President has told labor unions that he would, if it were up to him, attach labor and environmental conditions to the China trade relations vote. Does that undercut the President's efforts to pass this this year?
MR. SIEWERT: Well, I think there's less there than meets the eye in that story. I know the Vice President is talking to the unions today, and I think they'll probably have more to say on that today. But I know the Vice President supports China's entry into the WTO and he has urged Congress to grant China permanent normal trade relations this year. And I think in the past he's done that, and I think he'll continue to say that.
Q: Back to this LIHEAP stuff, just by doing the arithmetic here, it seems like it's about $300 million that was appropriated for FY 2000 in LIHEAP funding -- is that correct? You said that this is the last bit of it, that he's used it up.
MR. SIEWERT: Yes, essentially, we've released the entire appropriated amount --
Q: Which is about $300 million?
MR. SIEWERT: Well, I'll have to check and see if there were any disbursements in the fall. But, in essence, we released what was left in the fund for this year, and we will need -- the $600 million is a request that is meant to replenish it for whether it's heating emergencies or heatwave emergencies next summer.
Q: But doesn't that indicate, if you're requesting $600 million, that the program is woefully under-funded? I mean, your emergency --
MR. SIEWERT: We'll have to check. There may have been some disbursements in the fall. I'll just have to check. You may want to check with OMB on that.
Q: That amount is twice the size of what you've used up until now. Isn't there any way we could look at that as an indication that high energy prices could be problematic for a good long while?
MR. SIEWERT: I think what you can read into that is that we want to make sure that we have the money to deal with any contingencies that arise through the rest of the year and into the summer. It's basically meant to get through the end of the fiscal year.
Q: What influence are the Vice President's and the First Lady's campaigns having on the President's thinking on this issue? There have been criticisms that his decisions on LIHEAP and the Petroleum Reserve are electorally motivated?
MR. SIEWERT: Well -- none. The President has used LIHEAP in the past. We've actually fought Republican efforts to cut LIHEAP in the past. This is not anything that's novel. It's governed by law. The President is using the resources the federal government has available to help people who have been hit hard by a crisis. And as he said, we've done this in the past, used emergency supplemental legislation in the past to help farmers in the Midwest. We've used it to help earthquake victims in California. We've used it to help hurricane victims in South Carolina. But this is a fairly tested program, it is one we have used for a long time now, and this is certainly not novel or unique.
Q: Speaking of farmers, there is some word on the Hill that some farm aid might also be put into the supplemental. Any particular objection or support for -- the various farm constituencies looking for help in the supplemental?
MR. SIEWERT: I haven't heard that. I'll have to check into that. I know we have done supplemental assistance in other years, but we haven't said anything this year to date on that.
Q: Senator Byrd is apparently getting ready to introduce that mountaintop mining waiver that the President issued a veto threat over last year to the supplemental. Does the veto threat still stand if he introduces that this year?
MR. SIEWERT: Yes, we've said that that legislation is unacceptable to us. We proposed an alternative in some letters up to the Hill towards the end of the session. Given the time pressures, we were unable to work out an acceptable alternative, but our position on that has not changed.
Q: What do you make of Greenspan's comments that it would be unwise to release oil from the Petroleum Reserve to fight high prices?
MR. SIEWERT: Well, I didn't see those. Secretary Richardson said much the same this morning, that the statute governing the use of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is intended to deal with supply disruptions and not price disruptions. And I don't think I can improve on what Secretary Richardson said this morning, in that this is designed to deal with supply and not price.
Q: There are some reports that Elian Gonzalez's father may very soon, if he hasn't already, request a visa to come to the United States. Would the President support that or oppose that?
MR. SIEWERT: Dave, do you want to handle that? I haven't heard that.
MR. LEAVY: I haven't seen those reports. We've said all along, if the father or any of the family members, like the grandmothers, wanted a visa to come here, we'd expedite those requests. But I am not aware of any pending requests.
Q: One other question for David, actually. Watching the President's speech on the African Summit earlier, he made very few direct references to Rwanda, but he also talked about we no longer have the choice not to -- we either have the choice to act or not to act; we don't have the choice not to know any more. Is Rwanda the single biggest regret of his presidency, or why wasn't he making more direct references?
MR. LEAVY: Can we talk about Randy's jacket again? (Laughter.)
No, look, the President has talked about Rwanda when we went there back during his trip several years ago. I think he does regret how the international community reacted to the crisis in Rwanda. I think there are a lot of lessons that we've all learned, including the U.N. Kofi Annan put out a very honest and candid report several months ago about how the United Nations and the international community responded to that. I think there are a lot of lessons there.
What we've tried to do is learn from those lessons. One of the big initiatives and the big platforms in our Africa policy is what we call the ACRI, which helps -- the Africa Crisis Response Initiative -- which gives U.S. support and financing to indigenous African countries to develop their own peacekeeping and their own military capabilities to stop crises like we've seen in Sierra Leone and Congo. So we've tried to do that.
The President notified the Hill last week about our intention to vote for the peacekeeping mission at the United Nations for Congo. Trying to stop these conflicts before they reach the levels of genocide is an important lesson from Rwanda. So I think we've tried to implement the lessons into a policy framework. I don't think there is any intention to leave out Rwanda from his remarks, though.
Q: What is our funding level, our particular U.S. funding level for ACRI?
MR. LEAVY: Let me check on that. I know that the Congo mission is going to cost about $40 million. I believe that is what we requested for that specific operation. But let me check on the overall funding for ACRI.
MR. SIEWERT: We will take one more, and the travel pool should gather at the side doors. I gather the President is going somewhere.
Q: Bearing in mind that you don't want to comment on Greenspan's comments, what about his suggestion that interest rates will likely have to rise this year? Does the White House -- is it okay with that? What likely impact would that have on the economy?
MR. SIEWERT: I mean, I would just rather leave that one alone. We've done a very consistent job of giving the Fed lots of room to work on its own. We respect their independence and I'll leave it at that.
Thanks.

Bill Clinton,"February 25, 2000",Remarks on Funding for Native American Programs and an Exchange With Reporters,"The President. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I am delighted to be joined today by Senator Akaka and Senator Johnson; Sue Masten, the president of the National Congress of American Indians; Kelsey Begaye, the President of the Navajo Nation; and other distinguished tribal leaders from all across our country.
I'd also like to thank a few Members of Congress who are not here today but who have been vital to our efforts to increase support for Native Americans: Senators Daschle, Domenici, Bingaman, Inouye, Nighthorse Campbell, and Dorgan; and Representatives Kildee, Kennedy, and Hayworth.
Before I leave to give out the Baldrige Awards, I just want to say a few words about the importance of bringing the promise of prosperity to Indian country.
Nearly four centuries ago, not far from where we stand today, the Powhatan Confederacy enjoyed a prosperous trading partnership with the newly settled European colonists. As our country grew, many tribes gave up their land, water, and mineral rights in exchange for peace, health care, and education from the National Government. They formed solemn and lasting pacts with our country, agreements the United States, to be charitable, has not always lived up to.
While some of today's tribes have found success in our new economy, far too many have been caught in a cycle of poverty and unemployment. Too many have suffered from Government's failure to invest proper resources in education, infrastructure, and health care. The facts, of course, are all too familiar. American Indian unemployment remains unacceptably high, reaching 70 percent on some reservations. Onethird of American Indians and Alaska natives still live in poverty and many lack decent health care. Indians are the victims of twice as many violent crimes as other Americans. Nearly half the roads and bridges on reservations are in serious disrepair. Many schools are crowded and crumbling. More than 80 percent of the people in Indian country are not connected to the Internet, and one-third of Indian children never finish high school.
These facts are discouraging, but clearly not irreversible. That's because of something no statistic can measure accurately, the potential of the more than 2 million members of tribal nations in the United States. I am confident that with the right tools and the right support we can, together, bring new opportunity with new investment to Native Americans and to Indian reservations. That's something I made clear back in 1994, when I met with leaders from over 550 federally recognized tribes in our first government-to-government meeting here at the White House, and when I visited the Pine Ridge Reservation last summer. I want to make that even more clear today.
We're in the midst of the longest, strongest period of economic growth in our history. There is no better time than now to make sure Indian country has the tools to succeed in the new economy. If not now, when will we ever step forward to bring the hope of a good job, decent health care, safe communities, quality education, and new technology to every corner of this Nation, from Penobscot, Maine, to Window Rock, Arizona?
I was proud to announce in my State of the Union Address the single largest budget increase, nearly $1.2 billion, for new and existing programs that assist tribal nations. This bipartisan budget proposal includes funding to increase economic opportunity, health care, education, and law enforcement for Indian communities, in a cooperative effort with all agencies of our Government.
One of the first steps must be to make sure American Indian children and children everywhere in America have the education they need to succeed. My budget more than doubles last year's funding to replace and repair schools on reservations and to address the growing digital divide with grants to tribal colleges for information and technology training.
The information superhighway links people and communities across very great distances, but we can't abandon our old highways either. Our budget includes unprecedented funding to improve roads and bridges in Indian country. It also takes steps to strengthen tribal communities through improved public safety and health care. It increases funding for law enforcement officials and alcohol and substance abuse programs. Finally, it includes a 10 percent increase for the Indian Health Service, to expand access to high quality health care.
Working with members of both parties, representatives from tribal communities, and leaders from the private sector, together we can pass this budget and give the people in Indian country the tools they need and deserve to succeed. These are important steps, and we have an historic opportunity to achieve them this year. I ask Congress to work with me to seize this vital opportunity.
An old adage of the Sioux says, ""Each of us were created in these lands and from them will spring the future generations of our people."" We should all begin this new century by honoring our historic responsibility to the new generations of the first Americans.
Thank you.
Oil Prices
Q. Mr. President, at least two OPEC nations seem to have decided that they're going to increase their oil output. I'm wondering if the United States put direct pressure on them, and why do you think they are doing this?
The President. Well, I think that they're doing it because they believe it's in their long-term best interest. They don't want oil prices to go as low as they dipped at the bottom, not all that long ago, and we shouldn't either. But they know if oil prices are too high, one of two things will happen. Either they will provoke any economic downturn among their customers, and then the demand will fall off and the price will drop; or they will provoke more competition from non-OPEC members, and the supply will go up in ways they don't have control over. So I think that they would be making a sound decision to try to stabilize prices at a lower rate.
Q. Was there diplomatic pressure put on them to do this from the United States?
The President. I think—we are in constant contact with all the oil producers and all these other—as we are with other countries around the world. I wouldn't characterize it that way, however. I think this is a decision they will make on their own, based on what they believe is in their interest.
Iraq
Q. Are you easing the import restrictions on dual-use technology to Iraq, sir?
The President. What we are reviewing is whether there is some way to continue our policy of meeting human needs without allowing Saddam Hussein to rearm. I think it's clear to everybody who has looked at the facts, however, that they're exporting about as much oil now as they were before the embargo was imposed. And any continued suffering from lack of food and medicine on the part of Iraqi children or the poor is the result of Saddam Hussein's policies, not this embargo.
If you look at the difference in the health indicators of children in the north of Iraq where this program, the oil for food program, has been administered by the United Nations and in the rest of Iraq where it's been administered by Saddam Hussein, it's perfectly clear that he has increased the misery of his people and has blamed us for something that is no longer— clearly—clearly no longer attributable to the international community.
Nonetheless, if there is a way to further free up resources for the overall health and development of the people of Iraq without doing anything that will make it easier for him to rearm in ways that will be damaging to his neighbors and to the stability of the region, we ought to be open to that. And we ought to be careful and constructive in listening to arguments about it.
Yes, April [April Ryan, American Urban Radio Networks].
Secret Service Promotions Lawsuit
Q. Mr. President, what are your thoughts about the black Secret Service filing a suit against the Service in reference to promotions there, and especially in light of the fact that you supported the Secret Service officers that filed suit against Denny's several years ago?
The President. I knew what the facts were there. This case has just been filed. There are a lot of members of racial and ethnic minorities who have done very well in the Secret Service, and I think that it's better not to comment on the merits of the case. I will say this—I try never to pass up a chance to say I think that it is a superb organization. They do a wonderful job. And we have been, my family and I, very well served by men and women in the Secret Service of all racial and ethnic backgrounds. And I think that, beyond that, I shouldn't comment because it's in litigation, and there are very specific facts that are alleged that it would be wrong to comment on. But I think the Secret Service has given a lot of different kinds of Americans a chance to serve, and they have done it superbly well there.
Go ahead, John [John Roberts, CBS News].
2000 Presidential Election
Q. Mr. President, I know that you hate to talk politics, sir, and I don't mean to keep you here for a long time. And I realize that you don't want to influence the race, but we are about to go into a very important week here in the primary season. And I'm wondering, sir, without asking you to handicap the race, who do you see as being the stronger Republican candidate to go up against the eventual Democratic nominee in November?
The President. Sounds like a handicap question to me. [Laughter] I'll give you a straight answer which won't sound straight. I don't think you can know now. I mean, what happens is, in national political life, one person begins and is in total control of the way he or she presents himself or herself and is hot as a firecracker. And then a fuller picture comes out, and maybe even an attack or two comes out, and then that person once again returns to the ranks of human beings, and people make more reasoned and seasoned judgments.
And we're in a period where there's been a shift in that. But I think you have no way of knowing whether today's facts will be November's facts. So I don't think that—for our Democrats, my advice not only to the Vice President but for all of our people out there running is, run on what we believe in; run on what we've done; run on what you want to do. And don't worry about what the Republicans are doing. Just go out there and make your case to the American people, and don't worry about it, and time will take care of it. And then eventually these races, including the Presidency, will be joined. There will be two choices. There will be debates, and people will draw their own conclusions.
But I don't think—I think it is utterly impossible on today's facts to answer the question that you've asked with any confidence, because look how different today's facts are than the facts 6 months ago. And 6 months from now, they might be different again.
John [John Palmer, NBC News].
Situation in Chechnya
Q. Mr. President, there were reports today of really some horrendous atrocities in Chechnya, allegedly carried out by the Russians. Does this give you even more concern than you've had in the past about Russian behavior there?
The President. Well, of course it does. The reports are very troubling, and I think they again make the case for the right kind of unfettered access to Chechnya and to the people there by the appropriate international agencies.
I think, you know, in every conflict of any duration, there are always excesses. I'm not excusing anything. I'm saying that if you look at the fact that this is the second incarnation in this decade of the conflict in Chechnya, if you look at the bitter feelings, the tensions there— and I think it is imperative for the Russians to allow the appropriate international agencies unfettered access to do the right inquiries, to find out what really went on, and to deal with it in an appropriate way. I think that these reports should increase the sense of conviction that people all over the world have about that.
Permanent Normal Trade Relations With China
Q. One quick question on China. Key Democrats are saying right now that the chances of getting your trade policies through Congress are not very good, rather bleak. And it comes at a time when China has been doing a lot of saber rattling and also has been telling, basically, the United States to mind its own business regarding Taiwan. Do you really think you can get those trade policies through in this environment?
The President. Well, I think the environment is unfortunate, but I think you have to see those statements in terms of—in the context of the election in Taiwan for Presidency. I think that's what's going on here. Keep in mind, the United States has had now for two decades a ""one China"" policy that says we believe in one China, but we believe the differences between Taiwan and Beijing have to be resolved in a diplomatic manner, and we support a cross-strait dialog.
So in the context of this season, the President of Taiwan announced that he thought they ought to start acting like there was not one China, that it was—that they should be state-to-state relations. Then the Chinese made some military maneuvers which raised questions. We said the same thing then we said in light of their statements here. But it would be a mistake for either side to abandon a policy that has served both well for the last 20 years.
Now, having said that, in the absence of some destructive action, it would be a terrible mistake for the United States and for those who basically find this an uncomfortable vote to use this as an excuse to isolate China and almost guarantee the very things they say they're worried about.
Look, this is an economic no-brainer. It's almost—it's amazing to me that anybody could say the contrary. China opens all their markets to us for reducing tariffs, allowing us to invest there, allowing us to open business there. In some areas, we no longer have to transfer technology. We get special rights outside the WTO if they bombard our markets unfairly with cheap products that forge a big surge and throw a lot of Americans out of business. We have special rights in this agreement to go against them, something most Members of Congress don't know. So it is clearly an economic plus.
So the real issue is, from the point of view of national security, do you want them in the international system as responsible players, or do you want to say, ""We don't want you in the international system until you're governed exactly the way we think you should be and until you do exactly what we think you should. And until that time, we will keep you out, so there""? Now, based on all your knowledge of human nature, which do you think is more likely to produce constructive partnerships and constructive conduct on the part of the Chinese?
All I can tell you is, I know this is an election year. I know that some Members are receiving pressure—in both parties, I might add. I think it is very interesting that most of the religious groups, for example, that have done missionary work in China and have seen the impact of religious persecution or the absence of religious liberty there—virtually all of them that have actually worked in China strongly favor China's coming into the WTO because they understand once there are millions and millions of Internet connections, once the Chinese are open to the world, once they are involved in an international system, the Government will be more likely to be responsible, and the people will be more likely to find their own freedom.
And I believe that if we do not do this, that our country will be regretting this 5, 10, 15, 20 years from now. We will be shaking our heads saying, what in the world got ahold of our judgment in the year 2000? If we do it, 10 years from now, we will marvel that it was ever even a hard debate. That's what I believe. And so I'm going to stick with it, and I believe we'll make it.
Now, the statement on Taiwan may get harder, but you have to see it in the context of the electoral politics playing out in Taiwan and not necessarily assume that some destructive action will follow—just as I saw the Taiwanese provocative comments in the context of the Taiwanese elections.
Thank you. Thank you all very much.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-funding-for-native-american-programs-and-exchange-with-reporters
Bill Clinton,"February 25, 2000",Press Briefing by Joe Lockhart,"The James S. Brady Press Briefing Room
12:35 P.M. EST
MR. LOCKHART: He's not here. It's all I have. It's casual Friday. It's the only fitting way that we at the White House can deal with our terrible mourning and sense of loss we have, by dressing down. And that's -- I don't know how we'll ever get over this, but -- day to day, I guess. Day to day.
What's on your minds?
Q: Joe, the Canadian gun sale issue -- the United States announced it would cut off all gun sales, future gun sales, to Canada. What's behind all that?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, let me start with some facts, which were few and far between in that story. The United States has not cut off all gun sales to Canada. There is no action that has been taken against Canada.
Let me take a minute to explain what the process is. The United States has a system, through the State Department, of getting export licenses on munitions and also firearms. In the recent course of activity, the group that monitors this at the State Department noticed that there was a very large increase, surge in the requests for licenses for things like handguns and rifles and ammunition. Because this is what they do, they got in touch with Canadian authorities and queried them on the reason for the increase.
The Canadians were unaware, as only about a quarter of the request was for Canadian government and law enforcement, mostly Royal Mounted Police. At the request of the Canadian government, they asked that they continue to process the government requests, but they put a hold on the private commercial resellers of guns in Canada, while they got some answers on what was behind the surge of requests.
So the important thing here is that we have a system of export licenses that works. There was an increase; there was no apparent explanation on the face of it for those who process the licenses at the State Department. They, as they should, queried the Canadian government, who are now looking into it from their end. But these are licenses; these are not firearms that have already been shipped. They're just the right to ship firearms.
Q: But as I understand it, the Canadian government did this because the United States was going to go ahead and cancel if they did not.
MR. LOCKHART: No -- well, I talked -- I just got off the phone with the person who runs this operation, and who assured me that this was a step taken at the request of the Canadian government. We process the licenses, and we have the authority to move them forward or stop them. But it's my understanding that the Canadian government very much wanted time to look at what was behind this large request. And it won't move forward while they look at those issues.
Q: What's the big concern?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, the concern I think is on the part of the Canadian authorities. I think they want to know why there's such a large increase in requests for export licenses from commercial resellers. And they have the right to look at that and see if there's any underlying concern.
I think from our point of view, this is an example, though, of a system that works -- that we're able to, before a product is shipped through an export licensing system, look at trends, look at something like this where there is actually a surge, and work with the government on whether it is -- we believe it's appropriate and in our interest and in the Canadian interest to move forward.
Q: Just one more. Is there a concern that these guns are going into Canada and then back into the United States?
MR. LOCKHART: I talked to the State Department export control people who said they have never had that concern raised to them. I think as many of you know, the gun control restrictions are more restrictive in Canada, so I don't know the logic behind that concern, and it has not been raised at the State Department.
Q: We've seen pictures now -- this is to change the subject -- we've seen pictures of tied and bound bodies, mass graves in Chechnya. Any comment from the administration?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, I can't -- we're aware of the pictures and I can't authenticate those pictures, but there are certainly enough credible reports of human rights violations that exist that the Russians should move forward and answer the call of the international communities for a full and transparent investigation into human rights abuses. And that is never -- is as important today as it was before these pictures were seen.
Q: There's a quote from a Russian general saying, we have the right to kill, but not to torture. The tied and bound bodies indicates that there may have been some torture involved.
MR. LOCKHART: Well, there are certainly international standards, and Russia is bound by the international obligations for which they have signed. And that is why the international community has called for a full, thorough, and transparent investigation of human rights abuses, and that is why, whether these particular pictures are authenticated or not, that should be done.
Q: Joe, is there a new shift or review underway of the administration policy on shipments of various materials, dual-use, to Iraq, under the sanction regime?
MR. LOCKHART: There is absolutely no shift in U.S. policy on sanctions to Iraq. We believe that Saddam Hussein knows what he needs to do to get out from under U.N. sanctions against his country. And there will be no shift until he understands that and acts on it.
We have, since 1991, 1992, been strong supporters of the oil for food program. We know that there is a humanitarian need in Iraq. We will continue to be supporters and we will continue to work with the U.N. and other organizations to look at ways to make that program more effective.
Q: The Cuban that's been ordered out of the country, the diplomat, his people say today he's not going anywhere tomorrow. What's the U.S. response going to be?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, I'm not -- I don't want to telegraph either for you or for the Cuban government what we'll do, but we have a number of legal remedies that will become available to us after the deadline passes tomorrow afternoon and we will pursue an appropriate course based on the legal remedies that are available to us.
Q: What are some of the remedies that we have?
MR. LOCKHART: There is a legal system here that his immunity will be no longer valid based on international conventions. There are certainly remedies available through the Immigration Service. So we have a number of ways to go at this. We, for today, are going to continue to make clear to the Cuban government that this gentleman should leave.
Q: Do the resignations of John Sweeney and other labor leaders from -- making it even harder for the President to persuade Democrats to vote for NTR for China?
MR. LOCKHART: I don't think so. Our trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, has written to Mr. Sweeney and asked him to reconsider his decision. I think the President takes the advice of Mr. Sweeney and other labor leaders very -- and believes it's very important in crafting our overall trade policy. His help and assistance and advice has been invaluable in the past. This group is an advisory group and we believe that it is quite important that those voices are heard within this group, so we hope he'll reconsider.
As far as making the case on WTO, we are going to continue to make that on the merits and we believe that, given time and appropriate debate in the House and Senate, it will pass.
Q: Joe, back on Iraq for a second. How does the administration respond to criticism from someone like David Bonior who called the sanctions regime ""infanticide masquerading as a policy"" and others who are concerned about the elevated number of children's deaths?
MR. LOCKHART: We certainly take those views quite seriously and we understand that there is suffering in Iraq. We have worked very diligently with the United Nations and NGO organizations to find a way to get relief to the Iraqi people. The problem is who is standing in the way, and it's Saddam Hussein who has consistently stood in the way of either taking the steps he needs to relieve overall U.N. sanctions and even stood in the way of oil for food. He has decided that it is in his interest, his cynical, political interest, to inflict suffering upon his people. But, having said that, we are going to continue to work in ways as innovative as we can to make sure that humanitarian relief gets to the people of Iraq.
Q: Back on the WTO advisory panel, does the President agree with Sweeney's contention that the panel is not addressing issues of concern to labor, that it is only looking at the China thing and not at issues of labor and environment and trade?
MR. LOCKHART: Overall as a panel?
Q: Yes.
MR. LOCKHART: No, I don't think so. I think the panel has, particularly in the lead-up to the WTO meeting in Seattle, worked very consistently across a variety of different viewpoints, as far as trade goes, and worked very cooperatively. And that was quite a useful process. So I think it is certainly our hope that we can continue that process and Mr. Sweeney and some of the other leaders who have chosen to leave will come back so that their voices are heard.
Q: Also on China, the Europeans and the Chinese failed to reach an agreement this week. How big a setback is that and -- it's none at all, I can say?
MR. LOCKHART: Yes. I don't think it's a setback because we've made a deal which we think is very much in the U.S. national interest. If the European Union, in their negotiations, wrestle another market-opening concession from the Chinese, well, that's all the better. But what's important is that we believe that we've made a very good deal. We end the one-sided trade arrangement we have with China by going forward with the permanent NTR, allowing China into the WTO. And that deal stands on its own as a good deal.
Q: My question is really toward the timing. Congress is not going to take up permanent NTR until the Europeans finish their business. Isn't this delaying it?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, Congress -- listen, I can't speculate or predict what will happen between Europe and China as far as -- between the European Union and China, as far as their negotiations. As you know from watching our negotiations with China, these things never go precisely in a straight line. And just when you think things can't come together, they come together, and the opposite at times.
Congress, I think, should make a decision based on what is in our national interest. And they should dictate -- decide when to vote, how to schedule this vote, based on our national interest. And there is no reason that -- should those talks go slower than expected, there is no reason in the world why we can't have a vote here.
Q: Even without the European deal being completed?
MR. LOCKHART: Sure. Sure. We have made a deal that, on the merits of the deal, is manifestly in our national interest. And if the European Union and the Chinese work through the year to work out some issues that are important to them on a bilateral basis, there's no reason why we can't have a vote here.
Q: Joe, you said there's no change on the administration's policy towards Iraq. But in that article, they mentioned that the U.S. did lift a hold in $80 million worth of dual-use electronic goods earlier this week. Is that, in fact, true?
MR. LOCKHART: I'm not sure of that. I'll check on that. But I can tell you that we haven't changed our sanctions policy, and that any movement is designed, and intended, to work through the context of the oil for food program and provide humanitarian relief for the people of Iraq.
Q: Would it be fair to say the policy is under review?
MR. LOCKHART: The sanctions policy? No.
Q: The article made the point that there is a lot of dual-use equipment that's backlogged, or ordered. Is the United States, within the policy of maintaining sanctions, going to review releasing some of those dual-use technologies?
MR. LOCKHART: What I can say to you is we are working constantly on trying to use the oil for food program to provide humanitarian relief. We will continue to do that. We will continue to look at new ways to do that. We will not clear what we view as dangerous dual-use products to Iraq. That policy has not changed; that policy is not under review, as is our sanctions policy not under review.
Q: On the gun suspension story again, is there concern that these handguns and rifles might be re-exported from Canada to a third country, and is this linked to concern that's been expressed by U.S. Customs officials on occasions in the past that Canada has become a trans-shipment point for more sophisticated weapons going to countries --
MR. LOCKHART: There has been some discussions as far as more sophisticated munitions and trans-shipment. I don't believe that's related on this case. This is a case where export licensing authorities noticed an upsurge in numbers and the Canadian authorities are now looking at what are the underlying factors for that upsurge. And what's important here is that those licenses will not be acted upon until the Canadian government is satisfied that they understand the dynamic and, more importantly, the U.S. government is satisfied we understand the dynamic.
Q: What about the sanctions against Iran? Would the U.S. be willing to lift those in light of their election results?
MR. LOCKHART: We're only through step one in the Iranian elections. I think we have spoken about that and what it might portend. We have another step, at least, to go through. I think we're, at this point, more interested in engaging in a constructive dialogue and actually seeing progress on areas of concern, rather than analyzing election results. So I wouldn't try to see too far into the future on this.
Q: On the same subject, what is the position of the administration on the -- sanctions that the Senate adopted yesterday on nonproliferation?
MR. LOCKHART: On the Russia -- Iran? Well, obviously, we have spoken out in opposition to the version that the House passed, because of the restrictive nature of that. There was an amendment, a manager's amendment passed on the Senate bill that went some way towards addressing those considerations, particularly in the context of allowing discretion in the imposition of these sanctions. So we're going to work with the conferees and we'll have to see what comes out of the conference before we can provide any real indication of whether the President can support that and sign it into law.
Q: Does the President have any plans to personally involve himself in the debate in Northern Ireland?
MR. LOCKHART: The President has been involved at almost every point in the Good Friday Peace Accords and trying to find a solution to a longstanding problem. I think as you saw this week, you had a number of leaders from the Northern Ireland peace process here at the White House meeting either with the President or with senior officials in the government. We will continue to stay engaged and we'll continue to use the power and authority and respect that the President has with the parties in a way that hopefully can bring some progress.
Q: Has the President been in touch with President Bush?
MR. LOCKHART: Do we know the answer to that? I don't know the answer to that. I'll check. I certainly know that he was informed of his hospital stay and is encouraged, as all of us are, in the press conference he held telling the country how good he feels and the fact that he's going back home and going back on schedule.
Q: Joe, I guess what I was asking without asking was, would he consider acting as a mediator between these two sides?
MR. LOCKHART: I think the President will provide whatever counsel he can here. But ultimately, this is up to the parties to make the difficult decisions, to move forward, to put aside whatever issues have kept them apart in the past, and to make tough decisions for peace. And we've made it very clear that we'll stay involved where we can, but we can't force people to make decisions and we can't force people to make tough choices. That has to be done from the parties.
Q: Having consulted now with all the parties, do you feel that there is slight progress, slight movement?
MR. LOCKHART: I really don't want to get into trying to prognosticate on it. I think it's important work and the parties need to stay at it, because I don't think anyone will look back if they fail here and not see this as an enormous lost opportunity.
Q: Joe, what is the reason behind the announcement the President is going to make about the fiscal year 2001 funding for Native American programs?
MR. LOCKHART: I think the Native Americans are in Washington for -- the leadership of the Native American community are in Washington for a three-day convention. Many of the administration officials have gone and spoken to them. The President looks forward to the opportunity to meeting briefly with them and then making the statement. It's just to highlight the overall budget initiative for what the federal government is doing for the community in increasing our commitment to meet the many needs of that community.
Q: Joe, on the Commerce Department's numbers on the economic growth in the fourth quarter, two questions. Does it cause any concern about inflation within the administration? And number two, will it have any effect on surplus numbers for the 2001 budget year, as often times strong economic growth brings in a larger revenue stream?
MR. LOCKHART: You know, I think we have indicated, and the President as recently as yesterday indicated, that the fundamentals of our economy remain strong. Economic growth is strong, stronger in this report than even previously anticipated, in a somewhat favorable inflationary environment. I don't think there's any new concern this morning based on this number. But I think as the President indicated yesterday, you know, the Federal Reserve is looking at this and they'll continue to.
As far as how this might impact the surplus, I mean, clearly economic growth has an impact on it. But I don't know that anybody, based on one revision, has any sense of precisely what that impact might be.
Q: Joe, has the President received in advance already the drug certification process from the State Department? It's due to come out any time now.
MR. LOCKHART: No, I expect that will not be before next week.
Q: What's he doing this afternoon after the Baldrige Awards?
MR. LOCKHART: He has a top-secret staff event to attend. (Laughter.)
Q: What is that?
MR. LOCKHART: And I think that's about it. Does he do the radio address this afternoon?
MR. SIEWERT: Yes.
MR. LOCKHART: Yes, does the radio address.
Q: And that would be on?
MR. LOCKHART: That would be on the subject of education.
Q: Joe, the House is back next week; WTO meeting early next week, you imagine?
MR. LOCKHART: We have I think two more scheduled for this month. I don't have the precise days. Let's see, I have the week ahead here. We want to do that. Maybe that will give me my answer. The week ahead and then I'll leave so you can go cover the President. Good.
Week ahead. The President's weekly radio address will be broadcast at 10:06 a.m. tomorrow. Sunday, the President has no public events during the day. In the evening, the President will host the National Governors Association dinner at the White House. Expect about 40 governors to be here.
Q: Any coverage on that?
MR. LOCKHART: Pool press for toasts.
Q: Will George W. Bush be there?
MR. LOCKHART: That's a good question. You should ask him. I haven't seen his name on any of our lists. He's welcome, though.
The President will participate Monday in a roundtable with the National Governors Association at the White House, 9:30 a.m. to 11:15 a.m. Pool press for the remarks. We will do this like we do it every year. They will do some stuff that's open at the top; there will be remarks; then we'll leave and they'll have a discussion.
Later that evening, the President will attend the annual governors dinner of the Democratic Governors Association at Union Station.
Tuesday, prior to leaving for Florida for the fundraisers, the President will make a statement on departure on health care. The President will then travel to West Palm Beach and Miami for fundraising events. In West Palm Beach, he will attend a DNC luncheon at a private residence in West Palm Beach -- that's helpful, twice. At 1:05 p.m., in Miami, the President will attend a fundraising reception for Elaine Bloom, who is running for Congress, and later attend a DNC dinner.
Q: Do you know what he does in the big block of time in the afternoon, between 1:00 p.m. and 5:00 p.m?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, we're not finished until 2:00 p.m. We have to get to 2:00 p.m. and 5:00 p.m. Then we have to get down to Miami. So I think in the down time, there will probably only be a couple hours of it, and we will probably be late -- so probably not much of anything.
The President will attend a DNC lunch Wednesday, March 1st, at the Hay Adams Hotel. This is actually a meeting with some Democratic fundraisers, it is not an actual fundraiser. Later that morning, the President will speak at an economic event. And it says here the details for this are still being worked out.
Thursday, there are currently no public events on the President's schedule. Friday, the President will travel to California. We will have an event in the San Francisco area on Friday morning, which I can tell you a little bit more about at the beginning of next week. And then we will have a California Victory 2000 dinner for Senator Feinstein at the Mark Hopkins Intercontinental Hotel, and then a California Victory dinner at a private residence for the same Senator. Later that evening, the President will attend a DNC dinner at a private residence; overnight in San Francisco.
Saturday, March 4th, the President will be down for the morning and will travel to Los Angeles, California, later in the day, arriving around 6:15 p.m. He will attend a DNC reception and a DNC dinner that evening, overnighting in Los Angeles.
Sunday, the President will travel to Montgomery, Alabama, to commemorate the 35th anniversary of the 1965 voting rights march in Selma, returning to Washington that night.
Thank you very much.
Q: Any Chelsea time up in San Francisco?
MR. LOCKHART: Doesn't say anything about that on here. Okay, thanks.

Bill Clinton,"February 29, 2000","Remarks at a Democratic National Committee Luncheon in West Palm Beach, Florida","Thank you very much. First of all, Bren, thank you for your wonderful remarks and for opening your home to us today, giving those of us who suffered through an unusually long, cold Washington winter a chance to gaze out on the Atlantic under different circumstances, and for always being there for us.
I also want to thank you for what you have done for the most important U.S. Senate candidate in the country to me. Hillary had a wonderful time here, and I thank you and the rest of you who helped her. I thank you for that.
I'd like to join with Joe Andrew in expressing my appreciation to all the other officers of the Democratic Party and the Florida officials that are here. Congressman Peter Deutsch and Lori flew down with me today. We had a good time, and I was glad to be able to ferry them back home, for a few hours anyway.
I'd like to thank Danny Abraham, Cynthia Friedman, the Carters, all the others who have done this fine work today, and I'd like to put in a special plug for my longtime friend Representative Elaine Bloom, who is running for Congress here. She was for me in December of 1991, when only my mother thought I could be elected President. [Laughter] And I am for her in 2000. I'm going to do what I can to help. But I thank you for running for Congress. Thank you.
Let me just say a few words today about this millennial election and about why we're where we are. Eight years ago, when I ran for President, I did so because I thought Washington had become a place that was almost turned in on itself, obsessed with itself, and stuck in the thinking and the debate of a time that was long gone. It was obvious then that we were moving into a global economy, into a global society, that the whole way we work, the way we earn a living, the way we relate to each other and the rest of the world was undergoing a profound change. And yet, in Washington, we just kept repeating over and over and over again the same debates. Each party took the same sides, staked out the same opposite position. Paralysis occurred, and the results were not particularly satisfying to the American people.
And so I decided that I would ask the American people to give me a chance to try a different approach: to try to have a politics that would unite and not divide; to try to have a budget policy that would restore basic arithmetic to the American budget and to stop pretending that we could ever get rid of high interest rates and low investment and slow growth until we got rid of the Government deficit; to put the American people first in profound ways, so that it would no longer be about Washington but about how people lived out here.
And we've been working at it pretty steady now for 7 years and a month, and the results have been good. We have the longest expansion in history and the lowest unemployment rate and welfare rolls in 30 years, the lowest poverty rates in 20 years, lowest crime rates in 25 years. Adoptions are up. Ninety percent of our kids are immunized for the first time. The collegegoing rate's increased a lot. We've got 150,000 young Americans who are doing community service through the AmeriCorps program, 1,000 colleges with their kids out, going into grade schools every week to teach people to read. The country is coming together and moving forward. And that is the good news.
But I think the most interesting thing about this election is, in my judgment, that the winner will be determined by what the election is about—in the President's race, in the Congress races, in the Governors' races. And you have to help decide what the election is about. And there's more latitude now because things seem to be going well, so we're under the illusion that there is more latitude to decide what the election is about.
I always tell people the Presidential election is the world's greatest job interview, except that the job interview, unlike most jobs, this job interview has two components. First of all, people have got to be able to look at you and size up, ""Can I imagine this person having this job?"" And then they have to decide what the job is about. And they are two different things. If you don't pass the first test, you don't get to take the second one.
Now, I think all four of the candidates that are left passed the first test. The American people can look at them and imagine them being President. But the winner will be determined by, what is the job about? What is the election about; what is the charter; what do you want; what are we to do with this enormous amount of prosperity, this historic moment where we can make peace?
Very often, democracies mishandle good times, because people are under the illusion that it's just sort of on automatic and it goes on forever. And when I gave the State of the Union Address, I asked the American people to work with me this year and the Congress to try to overcome the partisan divides and to take a long look ahead at the big challenges facing America. I asked them to pay the debt off, get America out of debt for the first time since 1835. I asked them to deal with the aging of America. We're going to double the number of people over 65 in the next 30 years.
I released a Medicare report today that said the fastest growing group of seniors are people over 85. They will spend almost a quarter of their lives on Medicare. And since 70 percent of our seniors don't have access to affordable quality medicine, I'd like to see them get it under the Medicare program. But we also have to change the program so it will last longer.
We have to lengthen the life of Social Security. I persuaded this Congress to save the Social Security surplus—that is the surplus that we get because you pay more in Social Security taxes than we pay out now—but I haven't persuaded them to do anything with it. So the good news is we're paying down the debt. But the bad news is we haven't saved Social Security yet. Because if they would just take the interest savings we get from a lower debt and put it into the Social Security Trust Fund, we could run it out to 2050, which would take it beyond the life expectancy of all but the most fortunate baby boomers. We have to deal with this.
We've got to face the fact that we have the largest and most diverse student population in our history, and we no longer have an excuse for not making our schools excellent. We now know how to do it. We were talking the other night with the Governors, who just left town, in Washington. And there were a couple of people, one in my Cabinet, the Secretary of Education, and one retiring Governor, the Governor of North Carolina, who has the best school improvement record in America, and we were laughing about what it was like when we started as young men together 22 years ago as Governors. Everybody wanted to make the schools better, but we didn't really know how. Now we know. We have mountains and mountains and mountains of evidence of what works. And the National Government should play a role in that. There's nothing more important than giving all our kids a good education. Is that going to be a part of this election, or not?
We've got the crime rate down 7 years in a row. It's the lowest it's been in 25 years. But nobody seriously believes this country is as safe as it ought to be. We can make America the safest big country in the world. Columbine happened a year ago, and I'm still waiting for Congress to close the gun show loophole, to stop the importation of these large capacity ammunition clips, and to require child safety locks on guns.
Today in Michigan in a school, a 6-year-old boy, with a gun that his brother gave him, shot a 6-year-old girl. And she died. The child was 6 years old. How did that child get that gun? Why could the child fire the gun? If we had the technology today to put in these child safety locks, why don't we do it? I don't know what the facts were in this case, and I don't want to prejudge it or condemn anyone. But I know this: I know that the accidental gun death rate of children—the accidental gun death rate of children in America is 9 times higher than that in the other 25 biggest countries combined— combined. So we know what to do. We just don't have any excuses. Is that going to be a subject of this election, or not?
You have to decide that. And the same is true with health care. The same is true with the environment and whether we can grow the environment and improve the economy. The same is true with our obligations around the world. How do we define America's responsibility to fight biological and chemical and nuclear warfare, to fight terrorism, to advance the cause of peace, to fight against the racial and ethnic and tribal turmoil around the world, to advance the cause of peace through expanding trade?
I strongly believe—and our party's divided about it, I know—but I strongly believe we ought to let China in the World Trade Organization. Everything I've learned as President and everything I've learned in 53 years of living is that you get a lot more from people if you give them a chance to work with you than you do if you tell them you don't want to fool with them any more.
And we've got a big stake in how China turns out. I don't know how they will and neither does anybody else, but I know this: If we put them in this trade organization, they'll have to open their markets to us just like our markets are open to them. So it's a no-brainer economically. But politically, it's important, because they will have an incentive to make good choices in the future about their role in the world. If we keep them out, they'll still keep selling stuff here, they'll relate more closely to others, and they'll have no incentives to be responsible partners in the world.
If we do this, 20 years from now we'll wonder why we ever debated it. If we don't do it, 20 years from now we'll be still kicking ourselves. That's what I believe. So I'm going to fight for it.
But these things ought to be the subject of this election, because you know the world will grow smaller, not larger. We have the lowest unemployment rate in 30 years, much lower than anybody thought we could have without exploding inflation. But there are still people and places that have been left behind. Should they be the subjects of this election?
There are rural areas, Indian reservations, and inner-city neighborhoods where there are still people willing to work; where there is no free enterprise, no investment; where we could, by changing our tax laws and giving people like you the same incentives to invest in poor areas in America you have today to invest in poor areas in Latin America, in Africa, in Asia—I'm for that, by the way. I'm trying to get America to invest more money overseas, but we ought to have the same incentives to invest in poor areas in America.
Does this matter to you? I think it should. By the way, it's not only morally right; it's a good way to keep the economy growing without inflation. There are Indian reservations in this country where the unemployment rate is still 70 percent. If you cut it to 20 percent, just to 20 percent, all those people would become consumers as well as workers. It's noninflationary growth.
I'll just mention one other issue. You have to decide. I have found it incredibly ironic that in this most modern of ages, where I meet all these young people that have made fortunes in their twenties off dot-com companies—you know, I'm too old to make a living in this flourishing sector of our economy. And it is growing like crazy, you know. I just was at the Business Roundtable, and all these heads of these Fortune 500 companies were trying to figure out why the Dow was going down while the NASDAQ was going up. And we're doing all these incredible things.
I went in a little African village, and I saw a hookup from an American cable company and what they were putting in there so these kids could get modern maps to learn geography. I went into a favela in Rio with Pele´, the great soccer player, and saw what an American company was doing there, through technology, to try to get these poor children in Rio a chance to have a different life. I have seen all these efforts to bridge the digital divide in America, all this neat stuff and a lot of more mundane things. I have a cousin in Arkansas who plays chess once a week with a guy in Australia. I mean, you know, it's the modern world out there.
I know in a couple of months, I'll have an announcement that will be one of the great honors in my life. I'll be part of—we will announce that the human genome has been fully sequenced, and we can now set about the business of analyzing the very blueprint of life and why we turn out the way we do and how we deal with various things. We may be able to block broken genes with gene therapies to stop people from ever developing diabetes, to stop people from ever developing Alzheimer's, to stop people from ever developing breast cancer, all of these things. It's just going to be unbelievable.
Now, don't you think it's interesting, with all this stuff going on, that the biggest problem we face as a society is still the oldest one? We're still scared of people who are different from us. And it's easy, once you are frightened or uncertain, to turn that into distrust, to turn that into dehumanization, to turn that into violence, and then to have no conscience about it because they didn't matter anyway.
I mean, it's interesting—you look around the world, and you see tribal wars in Africa where hundreds of thousands of people die in a few days. You see continuing religious and ethnic tensions in the Middle East, and religious tensions continue in Northern Ireland, where I thought we had the door closed, and it got knocked open again. And what—this is outrageous—what happened in the Balkans, the problems they're having in Russia in Chechnya. You just look around the world, on any given continent.
And in America you say, ""Well, look at us. We're the most successful, diverse democracy in history."" That's true, but we had a shooting at a Los Angeles Jewish center, where Jewish kids were shot at because they were Jewish. A Filipino postal worker was killed because he was both Asian and a Federal employee, and the guy that killed him thought that was a double shot. Matthew Shepard was killed because he was gay. The guy in the Middle West killed the former African-American basketball coach at Northwestern, killed a Korean Christian walking out of church, and three or four other people, and he said he belonged to a church that didn't believe in God but did believe in white supremacy. And I could go on. You know all these issues.
What I want to say to you is that times are good, but we should be humble about this. We should be grateful, and we should be humble, because we have, number one, not repealed all the laws of human nature, which means there is still the darkness of the heart to deal with, and number two, good times are either made the most of or squandered.
And I just want to leave you with this. A lot of you here are younger than me, but a lot of you are about my age, maybe a little older. When we celebrated earlier this month the longest economic expansion, peace or war, in our history, I was very interested in that, because I love economics and I study it every month. I read all the numbers and everything and try to keep up with what's going on. So I went back and studied the last longest economic expansion in our history. Do you know when it was? Nineteen sixty-one to 1969, the years of my childhood and youth, when I should have been doing dot-com companies. [Laughter]
But let me tell you about them. In 1964, the height of the expansion, I graduated from high school. My President had been killed a few months before, and the country was heartbroken. But contrary to a lot of the Monday morning quarterbacks that look back, it was not the beginning of American cynicism. That's not true. We united behind President Johnson. He got off to a great start. He was leading us toward passing civil rights legislation, legislation to help the poor. And in 1964, when I finished high school, there was this enormous sense of optimism and confidence in the country that, A, the economic good times would go on forever; B, we would resolve in a lawful way, through our Congress, our civil rights challenges; and C, we would certainly prevail, without controversy in our country, in the cold war against communism. Those things would happen. Everybody thought so.
Two years later, we had riots in our streets. The country was already divided over Vietnam. Four years after I graduated from high school, I was graduating from college 2 days after Robert Kennedy was killed, 2 months after Martin Luther King was killed, 9 weeks after Lyndon Johnson said he wouldn't run for election. And the country was totally divided. And there were more riots in the streets, and the National Capital was the scene of a riot in which block after block burned to the ground.
A few months afterward, we had a Presidential election, the first Presidential election in modern times fought on the grounds of ""us"" versus ""them,"" where President Nixon, a man of immense talent, I might add, was elected on a theme of the Silent Majority. Now, some of you remember that. Now, if there's a Silent Majority, there must, by definition, be a loud minority, right? I was one of them; I know. [Laughter] So it was ""us"" and ""them."" A few months after that, the economic expansion was over. And we've been having ""us"" and ""them"" politics ever since. And for 7 years, I have worked to end that, I think with greater success out here in the country than in the Capital, but nonetheless, it's been an honor to try.
I'm telling you this as a citizen now, why I'm glad you're here. You have to help us define what this election is about. And that's what we're going to use your contribution for. But those of you who are older, like me, you remember what it was like in the mid-sixties. As a citizen, I have waited for 35 years for my country to be in a position to build the future of our dreams for our children. That's what this is about. It's not just about choosing a person. We have to define the job and the direction. Then the choice will take care of itself. You know what I think. But just remember how quickly these things can get away and what a heavy responsibility we have to make the most of a truly magic moment.
Thank you, and God bless you.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-democratic-national-committee-luncheon-west-palm-beach-florida
Bill Clinton,"March 10, 2000",Press Briefing by Joe Lockhart,"The James S. Brady Press Briefing Room
12:10 P.M. EST
MR. LOCKHART: I have no announcements, so, Kevin, why don't we start with you?
Q: I have a foreign policy question.
MR. LOCKHART: Okay, I'm ready.
Q: What were you really thinking when you arranged Ohio State? (Laughter.)
MR. LOCKHART: Let me say for the record that I wasn't involved in that decision, so it's hard to know what went into that. But Mr. Leavy, why don't you take that question? (Laughter.) I'll leave the book here, but I don't know if it's going to be helpful. Come on. Come on, why don't you take that.
MR. LEAVY: Well, Kevin -- (laughter.)
Q: Do you need me to repeat it? (Laughter.)
Q: I think Sandy didn't hear. I'm more interested in the modalities behind your thinking when you arranged Ohio State.
MR. LEAVY: Well --
MR. LOCKHART: Do you need -- do we need to remind people what happened there?
MR. LEAVY: I don't think so.
MR. LOCKHART: Why don't you go into the event a little bit.
MR. LEAVY: I don't think so, Joe. Actually, it was an effort to better communication our foreign policy goals and visions to the American people that, I think, went a little off-kilter. But the low point was, about a week later the late Meg Greenfield wrote an editorial about the public affairs fiasco in Ohio State. So 10 days, two weeks later, it still had legs. But we broke through, I guess, is the -- enough said.
Q: So you considered it a success?
MR. LEAVY: Well, I'm not sure a success, but --
MR. LOCKHART: It got on the news. (Laughter.)
MR. LEAVY: Yes, it broke through. It broke through.
MR. LOCKHART: Anybody else?
Q: Another foreign policy question. David, you recently admired Randy Mikkelsen's jacket here. We were just wondering, who gives you your clothing advice? Is it Jamie Rubin? (Laughter.)
MR. LEAVY: Well, after the Capitol Style piece on Jamie's clothing, I don't think I should go there. But we actually have a lot of very fine tailors in the White House. (Laughter.) That's one of the -- I think it was in the Garry Aldrich book, that we actually have yet to see -- the tailors in the basement.
MR. LOCKHART: David, I think you have a question from the gentleman from Salon in the back.
Q: We were just wondering if you had comments to our previous story?
MR. LEAVY: Aww, that is low. That is low. (Laughter.) That is low.
MR. LOCKHART: What story? Just say, ""no comment,"" and get out of that. (Laughter.)
MR. LEAVY: No comment.
Q: David, is it accurate that you only just got your driver's license? (Laughter.)
MR. LEAVY: That is true. That is true. Actually, my car broke down the day I graduated college, and I haven't had a car or a driver's license -- and I haven't had a license for eight years. My new employer said I'd be driving out to work every day, I had better get a license. So I snuck out last week and got my driver's license. And I have -- after this fun exercise, I can give everyone a briefing about the DMV and the ups and downs of the D.C. government.
Q: And your new driving ambition?
MR. LEAVY: Good, good, good. (Laughter.)
Q: David, is Sandy okay with you leaving like this? (Laughter.)
MR. BERGER: If I can quote one of my heroes, Richard Nixon: We're not going to have David Leavy to kick around anymore. (Laughter.)
Q: David, can we just still call you on Saturday mornings just for fun? (Laughter.)
MR. LEAVY: Absolutely. Well, I haven't told Sandy this, but one of the things that I'll miss the most is the 6:30 a.m. prep call that we do every time that Sandy is on one of the Sunday shows. We get up early to go over the morning papers. And that's always a fun exercise for me.
Q: -- spontaneous exchange. (Laughter.)
Q: David, I have a question for you. We heard your name mentioned on the hit series, ""The West Wing,"" and we're wondering if that signals you have a future in Hollywood.
MR. LEAVY: Actually, it's funny -- I just heard that Christian Slater has been signed up for a four-series arc as NSC spokesman, so I'm going to be talking to him. (Laughter.) I won't tell you who is going to play the National Security Advisor, because I still have a couple more hours before I get fired. (Laughter.) But, yes, it is Brad Pitt.
Q: Do you think they chose Christian Slater based on -- following the current spokesman of the NSC?
MR. LEAVY: Well, Matthew McConaughey was busy. They couldn't get him, so they -- (Laughter.)
MR. LOCKHART: Any of you guys want to say something serious about Mr. Leavy before we go?
Q: I would like to say something serious. Here's a fellow who does respond when you call and you page early in the morning or late at night, and that is always appreciated by reporters. We may not --
Q: As opposed to the rest of you guys. (Laughter.)
Q: We may not get a lot of information, but we get a call-back.
Q: He's talking about Hammer there, isn't he? (Laughter.)
Q: Yes, we really appreciate it. (Applause.)
MR. LEAVY: It's been a privilege and an honor, but a couple of thank-yous while I have the podium. To Joe, who gave me a lot of trust and taught me a lot about how to deal with the press and to manage a --
Q: He did? (Laughter.)
MR. LEAVY: He did.
MR. LOCKHART: Particularly you, Helen.
MR. LEAVY: But he has got the best judgment of anyone I've ever worked with. So, thank you Joe.
To Jim, who I wouldn't be here -- I wouldn't have had last job at the State Department or my current job here without him, so I owe him a lot. And he's taught me a lot about foreign policy. He's also the smartest guy I've ever worked with, and I'm sure I'll hear that again, but that's true.
Q: -- Sandy? (Laughter.)
MR. LEAVY: John, thank you. You've brought me in and made me a part of your team, which has been great and you've been a good friend and I appreciate all the leadership and everything that you've showed me over the last years.
I don't know if you remember this, but actually, Scoop and I were one of the first guys into the White House back in -- about a half-hour after the President was inaugurated in '93 --
Q: We remember. (Laughter.)
MR. LEAVY: -- and we were running around -- all the Bush people had left and we were the first Clinton people, and we were running all around in the Oval and we went down to your office as staff secretary. We were in there, literally, with our feet up on your desk and you walked in and you were like, ""what are you guys doing here?"" And you threw us out. (Laughter.)
So, thank you to you.
Q: He did the same thing to the press.
MR. LEAVY: To all my office colleagues, to Mike Hammer and Lindsey Huff and Matt Gobush, really great bunch of guys and gals. It's been such a great team and great friends, and they do so much for you that you don't see behind the scenes, so thank you.
And last, but not least, to Sandy. What can I say? You give me so much -- so much trust and confidence and friendship, and taught me so much about everything. I owe you so much for what you've done for me.
We've joked around about Ohio State, but I still remember -- I'll always remember coming into your office the day afterwards, really, really upset and down. You looked at me and said, you know what, no one bats 1,000. You go out there and let's do today's work.
So I owe you so much, Sandy. Thank you for everything. You are a great leader and have done so much for the foreign policy of this country. So much of what we do from this podium with all the press every day is sort of abstract, trying to explain these issues, but we really do affect people's lives and make the world a better place. And you have done so much in Bosnia, Kosovo, Haiti, Northern Ireland, the Middle East, to make this a better world. And we shouldn't forget that. So thank you for everything. (Applause.)
MR. PODESTA: I'm just going to introduce Sandy, but I just want to say that with all this knowledge and training and skill, experience, I'm really looking forward to America's new reptile shows on television. (Laughter.) I think it will be a really exciting experience. But the National Security Advisor -- Mr. Berger.
MR. BERGER: Your batting average did go up after Ohio State. It had to. (Laughter.) There was no place to go except up. Of the 17 or 18 spokesmen that the NSC has had over the last seven years, you know, I think David certainly is in the top 50 percent. (Laughter.) When I asked David to be the NSC Spokesman, which was around the time of that episode, I think there were a few people who said, you've got to be kidding; this guy is 27 years old and he will not gain the respect of the press and he's not a foreign policy guru, and so what are you doing here?
And I believed, and turned out to be more than vindicated, that David had both the intelligence and the integrity and the drive to do a terrific job for the administration, for the President, for the NSC, for me, and for you. And I think over the past two years, he's more than risen to the occasion, grown enormously, done a terrific job for us. Always been very aggressive about trying to represent your needs to us. And if we haven't always been responsive, it's not his fault -- it's our fault. And I will -- even though it's fun to kick David around, the fact is that I will miss him very much. And I have enormous gratitude for what you've done. Thank you, David. (Applause.)
MR. LOCKHART: There's way too much love in this room, so let's get back to the hostility. (Laughter.)
Let me just say, to finish this off, and I'll be very brief -- that when I came on, you all know my vast experience in foreign policy and the vast reservoir of knowledge that I drew on, which was exactly zero, and David and his team, every single day, were very helpful and guided me through a number of very tricky issues in a way that I think we represented the President and the U.S. government around the world in a commendable way, so I thank you.
I also, because my job is to move to the future, see someone in the back -- I think I see him staring at his shoes. I can't see that far. Is that you? We actually -- yes, there we go -- (laughter) -- we actually have a very fine replacement to complete a very good team. And I can't call him Colonel anymore, but P.J. Crowley will begin, I believe, next week and will do a fine job. I think you all know him and know that your needs will be met quickly and efficiently, with the -- what do you call an ex-Colonel?
MR. CROWLEY: Mister. (Laughter.)
MR. LOCKHART: Mister -- Mister Crowley. (Laughter.) So there we go. Questions?
Q: I have a question. What assurances has this government gotten from Pakistan that the President's going to be safe and his party are going to be safe and secure on this visit, in light of just another, you know, killing in the last 24 hours of that lawyer?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, I really can't get into the details of the President's security, only to say that we have a number of dedicated individuals whose role and job it is to protect the President, and they will do that.
Q: What about Pakistan? Have they given assurances the President will be safe?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, I'm not going to get into the private discussions on security between the governments. But we believe that the President will go in and, without getting into any details, will be protected.
Q: What about the relationship between the Pakistani government and the Taliban? There's some -- is there not, does that not add to the heightened concern over his visit?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, we have a number of issues that we're going to press, as far as democracy, nonproliferation, the fight against terrorism and the support of terrorism, and we will press them while we're there.
Q: Doesn't this have any effect at all on this visit? I mean, doesn't it change the -- or make the kind of solemnness of it even more --
MR. LOCKHART: No, I think it underscores, if anything, underscores the need to press for openness, democracy, constitutional rule. And those are points that we were already planning to make, and we will make while we're there.
Q: But does it make it seem like that the day that those things will happen is --
MR. LOCKHART: You know, listen, I think it's impossible to draw any conclusions based on the information we have now. This is obviously a cowardly act and a terrible tragedy for those involved, which we condemn. But at this point, I don't want to draw any further conclusions from that.
Q: The President had no second thoughts about this, in view of -- not in terms of his own personal security, but the whole fact of what happens to the defense lawyer?
MR. LOCKHART: I think we have a number of issues that we need to press while we're there, as far as the overall security of the region. And we intend to do that.
Q: Well, and the President doesn't think that there is any perception that this gives an imprimatur from the U.S. on that government?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, I think we -- for anyone who is under that perception, they would be wrong, and we will go to great lengths to make sure that that perception is dispelled.
Q: Do you think there is rule of law in Pakistan right now?
MR. LOCKHART: We think that obviously the constitution has been suspended. And we have been pressing the Pakistani government to return to democracy. We'll continue to do that.
Q: So ""no,"" is the answer?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, with the constitution suspended, it makes it difficult to answer that question affirmatively.
Q: Joe, about a half hour ago, the President said he's been given encouraging signals that perhaps the White House and Congress may be able to reach agreement on the minimum wage. Can you tell us what he was talking about?
MR. LOCKHART: I wouldn't want, right now, to be in the position that the Republican leadership in Congress is in. There are 10 million working Americans right now who deserve a raise, and they understand, for those who couldn't stay up until 11:00 p.m. at night when the Republicans pushed this through, they'll have to answer to the timing of that, but when they woke up this morning, they saw that they're not going to get their raise because the Republican Party's more interested in providing help for special interests as far as repealing overtime protections, giving a tax cut that we can't afford, and that wildly and disproportionately helps the top 1 percent of earners in this country, and they want to understand why.
I think this is an election year. I think there are, of those 10 million, there are people who, on both sides of the aisle, will be making their case to those voters, and they don't have a good answer right now. So I think after sort of looking at what the reaction to this is, they may have some pause to see if they can't get this done in another way.
Q: But, Joe, couldn't the argument be made that the House gave the President exactly the increase in the minimum wage that he wanted, and if people don't get it, it's because he's going to veto it?
MR. LOCKHART: No, because I think anyone who understands the House and understands how the rules work will see that they rigged this vote, that this wasn't a serious vote, it wasn't on the level. And whether their motives are they want to do another tax giveaway to the top one percent of earners, or whether they don't want the minimum wage at all and are just playing political games, the bottom line is the same: the way they wrote the rule, they're going to deny 10 million Americans a $1 raise over the next two years, and that's something that they've got to be able to articulate. And I think as they go around the country and go back and talk to their constituents, they'll find that their arguments don't work outside the Beltway. The special interests don't carry much sway outside the Beltway. The top earners who will get the lion's share of the benefit don't help very much with their constituents, and we may see a change of heart.
Q: Joe, when the President said ""encouraging signals,"" is he saying the reaction, political reaction, or from actual members?
MR. LOCKHART: Combination of reaction. The President and the staff here have been in discussions with members of Congress, and we'll just have to see where it goes.
Q: Would you seek to change this legislation in the reconciliation committee, or where would you --
MR. LOCKHART: I don't know how this will be done in conference. There's obviously two different bills. The House and the Senate have it within their power to do what the President's asked, which is to pass a straightforward, $1 raise over two years, and we'll see if they do that.
Q: Would the President consider something between the Republican tax cut and the Democratic tax cut that was offered? Is there some middle ground --
MR. LOCKHART: I don't think there's a lot of middle ground there, only because, first off, this is billed as a tax cut to help small business. While the Democrats have provisions that are quite generous to help small business, the estate tax provisions, the pension provisions are not designed to help small business. Nobody believes that. Nobody outside a small group of people on the Hill -- it may be hard believing the things that they write and the talking points that they're reading off of. But nobody in the real world believes this bill, as written, has really anything to do with small business.
When it comes to tax cuts, we've been clear on this: We are not going down the road that the Speaker of the House has articulated, that they're going to pass their tax cut from last year piece by piece. We need to see how it adds up, how you're going to pay for it and what its effect will be on important programs like education, the environment, Medicare, Social Security. We are not going to squeeze Social Security and Medicare for tax cuts that we can't afford, and we're not going to allow them to eviscerate spending on things like education and the environment.
We had this debate last year; we had this debate the year before. Their tactics have changed, but their overall goal hasn't. And if they think they can do this piece by piece, and hold things like minimum wage and 10 million working Americans hostage over this, they're wrong.
Q: Joe, now that large parts of Charles LaBella's memo have been published, will the President simply ask Janet Reno to release it to the --
MR. LOCKHART: No, I don't expect the President to get involved in that.
Q: Are you totally opposed to any reduction in the estate tax, Joe?
MR. LOCKHART: We have actually passed raising the ceiling, on a graduated basis, for the estate tax, which is going up every year through the next five or six years, I don't know the exact. But I think it'll be up well over a million dollars before too long. If they want to come down with a plan that targets this the proper way, so it doesn't exclusively go to the top earners, in a way that's affordable, you know, we can have a discussion. But we're not going to move forward in a way where they just take last year's tax cut, pull out the staples, and try to pass it page by page.
The public -- we had a debate on this. The public rejected it, the Democrats rejected it, and we will -- if they try to do it again this year, we'll reject it again. And I expect it will become a major issue in the campaign, because you've got Democrats who will be running against Republicans for House seats or gubernatorial seats. And the presidential candidates couldn't be further apart.
There is a candidate who represents fiscal discipline, and doing it the right way, and the other candidate who says we ought to just do a big tax cut and worry about how we pay for it later.
Q: But Joe, that debate will be ""who killed minimum wage increase""? Can't they say, the President vetoed it; he's the guy that killed it.
MR. LOCKHART: Well, sure, they can say anything they want. They say a lot of things that aren't accurate. But I think the public understands -- if you want to ask the public, who's committed to working families in this country, the President or the House leadership? I'll take that debate anytime. And I think they'll understand.
And we're going to get this done. We're going to find a way through the year to get it done. And if it takes another six months to get it done, or if it takes another five months, there will be some explaining that will be required from the House leadership on why they held this up. This is not over. We expect that before the year is over we'll have a minimum wage hike without the tax giveaway provision. And it's just a question of who stood in the way and who got it done?
Q: Why do you expect you'll get that? I mean, they're just going to cave? You're indicating here you're not going to allow any of these tax provisions --
MR. LOCKHART: I expect as the year goes on, the incentive for getting this done will increase and increase. And I don't accept the idea that there will be anyone who will buy the fact that the Republicans were for raising a minimum wage and the President blocked them. That's just -- it is not believable. It does not reinforce or work with any of what's gone on for the last seven years in this country. And I think if they somehow believe that this is their -- those who don't want to raise the minimum wage, but don't want to get blamed for it, I think this is going to fail.
Q: Can I ask you -- the vote on the tax cuts was 257-169. Are you concerned that that many Democrats joined with these tax cuts? You've been portraying it as a partisan bill. What were those Democrats doing voting for those?
MR. LOCKHART: Oh, no, I think certainly people know where we are on this, so I don't think there's any undue concern. I think the Democratic Caucus, as a whole, solidly supports a clean bill. They were thwarted from being able to vote on a clean bill by the rules, and we know the leadership controls the rules committee and the rule, and when they get a chance to vote on it, I think there will be a solid vote. And I think you will find that there's that many and more Republicans voting for it.
Q: That still doesn't answer the question, why they voted for these Republican, as you are characterizing them, tax cuts.
MR. LOCKHART: Because I think -- listen, you'll have to ask them, and you'll have to ask why, given the situation where the will of the House was thwarted -- listen, a majority of the House, Democrats and Republicans, want to vote on a clean bill. They've being denied that chance. And if the Republicans want to come clean here and make this a real up or down vote, that you ought to put it on the floor and we'll see what happens.
Q: Joe, going back to the LaBella report, the report charges that there was sort of sufficient grounds to investigate the President, the First Lady and Vice President Gore on fundraising irregularities.
MR. LOCKHART: I would go back to the first, second and third time you did this story two years ago. I don't have anything new on it.
Q: Can I ask one other question?
MR. LOCKHART: Yes.
Q: In light of the fact that campaign finance reform has become a big issue in these elections and the whole issue of soft money and the Vice President has said that he's willing not to use any soft money if the Republican nominee does the same thing --
MR. LOCKHART: A pledge the President made.
Q: Okay, but why not the President sort of set an example and stop raising soft money and send --
MR. LOCKHART: Because we're already going to be out-spent in this election. And we all see -- look at what happened between the Republican candidate. The candidate who went out and broke through all the limits raised whatever -- $70 million -- was able to go out and -- I mean, look at some of the ads he put on the air. I mean, there were some preposterous claims made. But you get enough money and you put it on the air, and it has some value.
We're already going to be out-raised. Democrats need the resources. These are the rules of the game. But there is a difference between the parties -- the Democratic Party, every single member of the House and Senate, has voted for McCain-Feingold or for Shays-Meehan. The Republican leadership, although there's Republican support for it, the Republican leadership has thwarted that at every stop.
So if there is a battle here for who wants to change the system. The Democratic Party has an excellent record. They want to change things. If voters are for that they should vote for them. Or if they're for the status quo, and because there is certainly a case to be made on the other side, you have some excellent leaders in the Republican Party who have articulated that case.
Q: Joe, I want to ask you one specific question about the LaBella report, one allegation in there -- that the President and Mrs. Clinton failed to inform the Democratic National Committee that Charlie Trie was raising foreign money --
MR. LOCKHART: Again, that is something that was reported two years ago, and you can go back to the reports you did on it then.
Q: But can you simply respond to -- I mean --
MR. LOCKHART: No, I'm not going to respond to recycled information here. We responded very openly several years ago when these things first came up and I don't have anything new. There's nothing new about that and I've got nothing new to say.
Q: What is new is, apparently, details from this memo, which have not been seen before, which said that there was a pattern of conduct worthy of an investigation. I mean, that is new information. Can you at least react to that?
MR. LOCKHART: That is not new information. That was leaked in the press before. Go back and look. The only thing I'll say is the Attorney General made her decision based on the facts, the evidence and the law.
Q: The President signed the Child Abuse Protection Act law this morning -- why did he feel it was important to do now?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, it's an important piece of legislation. I think Congresswoman Tubbs Jones was here; I saw Congressman Lazio here. Senator DeWine, Senator Leahy. It's an important piece of information that allows and provides the funding for communities to go out and take care of abused children. This is an issue that -- there are some 9,000 reports a year of child abuse in this country, and it's something we need to do more on. I think the President was very happy to sign this and commended the leadership of a bipartisan group of members of Congress to get this done.
Q: Secretary of State Albright had a strongly worded editorial in Wednesday's Washington Post regarding Chechnya and Russia. My question is, with our condemnation of what's going in Chechnya, their condemnation of the NATO bombing campaign in Yugoslavia, NATO expansion, and now possible Russian arms sales to China, are U.S.-Russian relations experiencing some kind of new post-Cold War low?
MR. LOCKHART: I'm not going to try to rate year by year. We clearly have mutual interests, as far as promoting economic development and democracy in Russia, that we worked very hard at; security issues, arms control and the denuclearization of Russia. We also have problem areas, which we work hard to make our case -- Chechnya, certainly, at the top of that list right now. But we continue to work with the government. We will continue to work with the democratically elected, the new government, when they come in and try to work through these problems.
Q: Is there concern, though, particularly now, the coziness of the relationship between China and Russia?
MR. LOCKHART: I've not heard expressed to me any particular concern here. I think we do have concern on Chechnya and we've made that case quite strongly.
Q: A lot of the Irish leaders will be in town next week. Any reason to think there will be more than just conversations at the margins, or if there could be any real progress in the situation?
MR. LOCKHART: I'm not in a position to predict progress, but the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister set out a framework for discussions to try to get Good Friday back on course, and included in that was the idea that the leaders would all be here and would have access to the President. So I do expect them -- the President to talk with the leaders. But I'm not in a position now to predict any sort of progress or what might come of it.
Q: Please indulge me with one more question on this LaBella stuff. The LA Times report also said that the Department of Justice had a White House photo of the Vice President at a meeting looking through documents, in which the meeting was largely held to discuss the implications of hard versus soft money. Would you be willing to release that photo?
MR. LOCKHART: I don't know anything about the photo.
Q: Obviously, it would be in our archives, it could be looked up, we know the date of the meeting.
MR. LOCKHART: Okay. Well, I don't have any reason to believe that photo will be released.
Q: Why?
MR. LOCKHART: We have worked with all parties, whether they be on the Hill, whether they be at the Justice Department in these inquiries. We've been very forthcoming. If there are further inquiries, we will be forthcoming, but we're not going to respond to every request that you all have.
Q: Will you be forthcoming to release the picture?
MR. LOCKHART: I think I've answered the question.
Q: German officials are saying they're getting pretty close to reaching a consensus among European nations on their candidates to head the IMF, and they expect some kind of formal endorsement on Monday. Does the administration consider this a positive development? Is it ready to say what it thinks --
MR. LOCKHART: Listen, I think as I've said through the week, I'm not going to provide color commentary through the week as a consensus develops. We're looking for a European candidate who has consensus support in Europe, who has support in the developing world, a gentleman or a woman
who has got maximum stature. We will make a judgment at the point where there is consensus behind a candidate.
Q: Beyond the issue of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and gasoline prices, there's been growing talk on the Hill of possibly repealing the .4.3 gasoline tax that was enacted in 1993, maybe opening up some new areas for drilling and help domestic industry. Do you have any --
MR. LOCKHART: I've heard -- you describe it correctly as talk. There is not a proposal, and Chairman Archer has spoken out forcefully against this idea. I think any time you look at a tax provision, you have to balance the overall questions of fiscal discipline, and in this particular case, the impact on the Highway Trust Fund. It's very important that we continue to make the investment in both new construction and infrastructure repair on the highways that are very much needed.
So we'll be happy to look at a proposal when and if one is developed, but my guess is, with the Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee having spoken out against it, it's not going to move very far on the Hill.
Q: Given that Lott called it yesterday ""the Gore tax,"" the Vice President cast the tie-breaking vote for the .4.3 tax, that this is basically politically motivated, or do you think it's --
MR. LOCKHART: Listen, if Senator Lott wants to get into an extended debate on economics and what the last seven years held, and the tie-breaking votes that the Vice President had, I say let's go for it, and let's have it now, because if it wasn't for the Vice President's votes in the Senate, if it wasn't for the Democrats, we wouldn't have reduced the deficit; we wouldn't have created 20 million jobs; we wouldn't have lowered interest rates; we wouldn't have the lowest unemployment rate in 30 years; we wouldn't have the highest investment in three decades. So if they want to have that debate, I think we can pick a time and place, and we'll show up.
Q: Joe, on minimum wage, where is the evidence that the President's willing to compromise? If the House Republicans gave him the minimum wage increase that he wanted, why can't he go along with some of the tax breaks they want?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, if their tax break's designed to help small business and they have a way to pay for them within the context of fiscal discipline, we'll be willing to look at it. What they've put on the table has nothing to do with helping small business. And I think any independent observer would reenforce that.
Q: So you're saying if they drop the estate tax -- the remainder would have been acceptable?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, I think they're also going to have to take a look at some of the worker provisions that are in there. There's no reason in the world our raising the minimum wage is somehow a magic formula for rolling back overtime protection for workers. I mean, it's like giving somebody a raise and then taking away a large bit of their income. That doesn't make any sense.
Q: And one more on Pakistan. Would it be accurate to say that the U.S. Secret Service is confident it can adequately protect the President during his visit in Pakistan?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, I think it'd be accurate to say that I don't discuss the President's security, and that I would put that question to the Secret Service.
Q: But that's an assertion you're always willing to make wherever he goes, and it just seems odd you phrase your response that way.
MR. LOCKHART: No, I think the assertion that I always make is that the President's protection is one subject that I don't ever talk about, and that I leave the Secret Service to address.
Q: Shouldn't the American people be able to assume that the President wouldn't go somewhere that the Secret Service didn't think they could protect him? I mean, that's --
MR. LOCKHART: I'm not trying to disabuse anybody of any assumption one way or the other. I'm just trying to not go down the slippery slope of discussing the details of his security.
Q: On Monday in Ohio, the prescription drug -- are we seeing anything new there? Or is that -- of yesterday?
MR. LOCKHART: I think the President is going to take the opportunity to get out of Washington and make the case where -- in an area where people understand the importance of a prescription drug benefit, where people in that area have some firsthand knowledge of the, you know, the injustice of people a few hours -- and actually, in Cleveland, a few miles -- away in Canada, who get cheaper prescription drugs, American-made prescription drugs. And I think he'll use this opportunity to make the overall case to try to help build support and get Congress moving on this.
Q: Do you know what kind of audience he'll be speaking to?
MR. LOCKHART: I think it's an audience of primarily seniors.
Q: Has the Pakistan government given -- you know the Secret Service is not going to discuss it, either.
MR. LOCKHART: Right. I did know that. (Laughter.) And I knew you knew that, too.
Q: So this is a lot of baloney you're giving us, you know --
MR. LOCKHART: No, it's not -- that I would dispute.
Q: Has the Pakistan government given any assurance --
MR. LOCKHART: I think that that is a subject that I'm just not going to get into here. I think the question that Mara raised was accurate, was the right question. I think you can expect that we're not going to go off into a situation that poses unmanageable risks. But I'm just not going to get into any assurances that have been given, and any details of the security for the President's visit.
Q: How long is he going to be in Pakistan, and what is he going to do?
MR. LOCKHART: We're still working that out. We'll let you know.

Bill Clinton,"March 27, 2000",Statement on the Election of Vladimir Putin as President of Russia,"In a telephone conversation earlier today, I congratulated President-elect Vladimir Putin on his victory in the Russian Presidential elections.
Sunday's vote was an important milestone in the development of a democratic Russia. The people of Russia demonstrated again their intense commitment to democracy. Roughly 70 percent of eligible Russians voted.
In my conversation with President-elect Putin, I emphasized the importance to Russia and the world of strengthening the foundations of Russia's democracy and deepening its international integration. President-elect Putin has an opportunity to translate his electoral mandate into concrete steps to advance economic reform, to strengthen the rule of law, to intensify the fight against crime and corruption, and to join with us on a broad common agenda of international security, including arms control, nonproliferation, and regional peace and stability.
Finally, I emphasized my concerns about the war in Chechnya. I stressed to President-elect Putin the importance of launching impartial and transparent investigations of reported human rights violations and providing prompt and full access for international organizations and the press.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-the-election-vladimir-putin-president-russia

Bill Clinton,"May 25, 2000",Press Briefing by National Security Advisor Samuel Berger and National Economic Advisor Gene Sperling,"The James S. Brady Press Briefing Room
12:55 P.M. EDT
MR. CROWLEY: Good morning. The President leaves on Monday for a trip to Europe, to Portugal, to the U.S.-EU summit, to Germany, to Russia and Ukraine. And here to give you a synopsis of our travel agenda is the National Security Advisor Sandy Berger and the National Economic Advisor Gene Sperling, starting off with Sandy.
MR. BERGER: Thank you, P.J.
Let me begin, as usual by seeking to put this in a broader context, and then I will run through the individual stops and what we expect to achieve or hope to achieve. I think it's useful to look back to the President's first trip to Europe in January, 1994. At that time, there was discussion about a Europe whole and free. There was no real blueprint for that.
The President, in '94, outlined a blueprint, and in the years since we have made significant progress. At that time, many questioned the relevance of NATO after the Cold War and feared a neglected gray zone between Western Europe and Russia. Western inaction in Bosnia was one more factor that was calling to question the future of an alliance that maintained its Cold War membership and mission.
In the meantime, we have adapted and enlarged NATO, the Alliance is stronger than ever, we've stopped a war in Bosnia and ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, and now NATO and other forces are there, helping to secure a peace.
NATO, in the meantime, has become a powerful magnet for the new democracies of Central and Eastern Europe. It was once said around that time that Europe's project for a single currency and security policy would either fail or cause transatlantic alliances to fray. But the EMU has been established, Europe is developing a stronger defense identity within NATO, the President is about to attend his 14th U.S.-EU summit, which is certainly a record.
The U.S. has supported a stronger Europe as a complement to, not a competitor of, a stronger trans-Atlantic alliance. A few years ago there was a widespread fear that Russia's gains would be reversed by the nationalistic or community backlash. There have been lots of setbacks along the way, and the final outcome of Russia's transition still remains an open question. But the Russians have repeatedly rejected return to the past and they've just completed the first democratic transfer of power in Russia's 1,000-year history.
So this trip, at least in part, is an opportunity to take stock of the progress that has been made and to build on the vision that the President articulated in Brussels back in January, 1994 -- a peaceful, undivided, democratic Europe for the first time in history. It's also a chance to focus on two pieces of unfinished business. That vision, integrating southeast Europe and helping to build a modern, democratic Russia in one enduring challenge, maintaining the strength of the trans-Atlantic relationship.
Now, let me walk through the itinerary. As P.J. indicated, we'll leave late on Monday -- or later on Monday; travel first to Portugal, which in and of itself is quite a remarkable success story. It's been 26 years since their revolution and it has gone from a dictatorship to a democracy, from genuine backwardness to relative prosperity, from isolation to engagement.
The Portuguese -- President Guterres and Portugal, itself, are completing a very impressive tenure as rotating President of the EU, during which they convened two special summits, one on Africa and one on the new economy. They very ably managed the development of the emerging European security and defense policy, and a great deal of credit goes to Prime Minister Guterres.
Following an arrival ceremony, the President will meet with President Sampaio, and then with Prime Minister Guterres. I expect the discussions to focuse on European security issues, Southeast Europe, our cooperation on East Timor, and the work that we're doing together in a number of African countries.
The President will visit a Science and Technology Museum in Lisbon, and speak with a number of people involved in it. Prime Minister Guterres has undertaken an effort to open a new frontier of discovery for one of the oldest exploring nations in the world. Portugal is doing very advanced work in science, combating infectious diseases like AIDS and malaria, in collaboration with American scientists and supported by NIH. And that, of course, is an important priority for us. And we will finish the day in Portugal with a state dinner hosted by President Sampaio.
The second day in Portugal is focused on the U.S.-EU Summit. As the EU has deepened and expanded, with the monetary union, with the common foreign and security policy, coordination of justice and home affairs issues, broadened membership, the U.S.-EU relationship has become much deeper and more important.
The President, several years ago, instituted these twice a year summits. He was right to do so. Our trading relationship, for example, between the United States and the EU is more than $1 billion of trade every day. This is an extraordinarily broad and deep relationship.
Remarkably, American investment in Europe increased seven fold between '94 and '98. In the meantime, Europe is the leading investor in 41 of our 50 states. Gene will talk about some of the remaining trade disputes with Europe; they're certainly not trivial, but it's not surprising, I think, given the volume of our trade.
Similarly, the EU is increasingly a partner of ours on security, as it develops a common, foreign and security policy backed up by a defense policy. Henry Kissinger used to say that the wished that he had one phone number to call in Europe to find out what Europe's foreign policy was. Well, now, there is, it's Javier Solana. His phone number is 322-285-5661. (Laughter.) I read that very quickly, so poor Javier doesn't get bombarded.
Our agenda will focus on the security side on Southeast Europe, the Balkans; on Russia, on the ESDP, the European Security and Defense Policy -- on trade and economic issues -- Gene will talk about those. And then they have set some time aside during the summit for a discussion of the new economy.
I also expect they will talk about cooperation on infectuous diseases and see whether we can gain the EU's support as we head into the G-7 summit in July for a broader initiative on infectuous diseases in the developing world -- HIV, AIDS, TB, malaria.
And, finally, after the working lunch, the President, Prime Minister Guterres and EU President Prody will conduct a press conference.
We then travel to Germany, we arrive there Thursday afternoon. The President initially meets with President Rau, then with Chancellor Schroeder. He'll have a private dinner with the Chancellor that evening.
I expect they will talk a good deal about Russia in light of the President's trip, and I believe Putin is coming to Germany sometime in the not-too-distant future. We'll obviously also talk about the Balkans. You may recall that it was a year ago that Chancellor Schroeder and President Clinton, when the President was in Bonn, launched the stability pack, an effort to collectively deal with Southeastern Europe, and I think it will be time to take stock.
The President also will have an opportunity to meet with some younger German leaders who are building partnerships with America, many of them actually working on projects in Kosovo and Bosnia and elsewhere in the Balkans -- sort of NGO to NGO, people to people cooperation.
This roundtable discussion will be the first in a series of what is being called ""America's Voices,"" a dialogue with prominent Americans from government, arts, media and science that will take place in Germany over the next six months. It's taking place in connection with Expo 2000 in Hanover, and the President wants to start off by hearing from some dynamic German voices.
On Friday, we travel to Aachen, where the President will receive the Charlamagne Prize. This is the 50th year of a very prestigious award, given to leaders who have made major contributions to European unity and world peace. Previous winners have included Jean Monet, Robert Schuman, Winston Churchill, Vaclav Havel, Helmut Kohl and Tony Blair.
The President is only the third American to receive the award, in addition to George Marshall and Henry Kissinger. And I hope someone will tell Henry that I've mentioned his name twice here today.
In Aachen, the President will make a major foreign policy address, looking back at the effort to build an undivided, democratic, peaceful Europe and focusing on the unifinished business that lies ahead. Then it's back to Berlin. The President -- will take place in a conference on good governance known more popularly as the Third Way. One of the interesting aspects of this conference is it will be far larger and broader than the previous such conversations. It will be hosted by Schroeder, but there will be 15 other heads of state, not just from Europe, but also President Mbeki of South Africa; Cardoso -- Latin America; De La Rua, Argentina; Barak, Helen Clark from New Zealand; leaders from I think four continents. It begins with dinner on Friday, and then working sessions on Saturday.
On Saturday evening, we leave for Russia, where the President will arrive at 7:00 p.m.-7:30 p.m. Obviously, it's an important time, following the inauguration of the new President, Vladimir Putin, and the election of a new Duma.
The question now is not only where Russia is heading, but how it intends to get there. The issue is whether the systemic changes that are needed can take place without undermining democratic freedoms. Is the Russian government consolidating its strength as an end in itself, or as a means to bring prosperity to its people and deepen Russian integration in the international community -- these are all conversations I think the President will have with Putin, and vice versa.
I think you should understand that this is the first of what is likely to be four meetings that President Clinton and President Putin will have over the remainder of this year. We expect to see -- we will see President Putin in Okinawa at the G-8 Summit. We expect him to be coming to New York for the Millennium Summit in September, and then we will see him again at the APEC meeting in the fall. And so this is the beginning of a dialogue.
The President will urge Russia to seize the opportunity that has been afforded by its current economic recovery to press ahead with reforms that will make the recovery last. He will urge respect for democratic freedoms, especially for press freedom; and affirm publicly and privately our continuing concerns about Chechnya.
We'll address a range of issues there, including arms control issues. Non-proliferation will be a major topic. We're making significant progress on our threat reduction efforts to secure and dispose of fissile material that could be used for nuclear weapons. I hope that we will be able to reach an agreement by the summit that will result in the disposition of 34 -- the destruction of 34 tons of military-grade plutonium on each side. This is an enormously important agreement if we are able to finalize it. That's enough plutonium, literally, to make tens of thousands of nuclear weapons. And obviously, it's a non-proliferation issue, as well as a bilateral issue.
In addition, we expect to continue our discussions about missile and nuclear proliferation, and cooperation to prevent leakage of Russian technology to countries like Iran.
The summit will begin Saturday evening with dinner between the two Presidents. It will resume on Sunday in two sessions during the day. The two leaders will then have a press conference on Sunday afternoon. On Sunday evening, the President will do an interview with a major Russian independent radio station, which is a chance to reach out directly to the Russian people and express support for the independent media in Russia.
On Monday, the President will address the Russian parliamentarians, and by extension, the Russian people at the Russian State Duma. This is the first such address ever by the United States President.
That afternoon we're off to Ukraine. We also have a broad agenda, as you know, with Ukraine, including non-proliferation, economics, security cooperation. The visit comes at a very interesting and critical time in Ukraine's transition. President Kuchma has recently been reelected over a communist rival. He's appointed a quite impressive new Prime Minister who was here a few weeks ago. They've taken some hopeful steps toward reform, down-sizing government, strong budget, laying the groundwork for privatizing land.
The President will meet with Kuchma in Kiev. We also anticipate a speech to some outdoor gathering. His message will be simple: Your success, Ukraine, is important to us. And it is obviously -- a path has been marked by Ukraine's neighbors in Central and Eastern Europe; if you stay the course, the road to Europe is open to you. And we hope in delivering that message it will be heard not only in Ukraine, but beyond, in all of the nations of the former Soviet Union. We also hope to be able to discuss progress towards ultimately shutting down the reactor in Chernobyl, which continues to be an issue that we're working on.
We will arrive back here on June 5th. We will change our laundry -- we will wash our laundry, I guesss, change our clothes, and on June 7th, we will leave for a quick trip to attend the memorial service for Prime Minister Obuchi in Japan, and we will immediately return to the White House. So that will be -- I don't believe we will be staying overnight in Japan. We'll be taking a little, short hop over to Tokyo, going to the memorial service, and coming back. The President believes that it is extremely important, given the fundamental importance of the U.S.-Japan relationship that the United States express its solidarity with the Japanese people and its support for our partnership.
Let me ask Gene to talk about the economic issues.
MR. SPERLING: As Sandy said, the trade and economic parts of this discussion or this trip are really divided into two parts; the first being the trans-Atlantic economic partnerships with the EU and the second being the discussions in Russia and the Ukraine.
The centerpiece of the President's discussion of U.S.-EU economic issues will occur on May 31st at the U.S.-EU summit in Lisbon. The summit will provide an opportunity for us to engage in discussion with our largest trade partner. We now have over $450 billion of trade between us and two-way investment is now approaching $1 trillion.
As Sandy said, the EU is very interested in having the economic portion of the summit focus on the new high-tech economy, making that a central theme of the summit. And I think they're very interested in sharing with us some of their ideas in areas that the President has been involved in for several years.
For example, they have an e-Europe initiative in which they have established goals very similar to the type we have of connecting all their schools by 2001, classrooms by 2002, et cetera. We also would like to clearly use the occasion to try to -- building up to the G-8 to get more focus on the importance of the type of telecom liberalization and deregulation that is necessary to have this part of the economy become as vibrant as it has been in the United States, where the degree of competition since the telecom deregulation competition bill has led to unquestionably more competition, cheaper prices, cheaper access, and I think most people believe the greater dissemination of these tools have been a contributing factor in the significant rise in productivity.
It also raises other issues, if one thinks about it. If you think about the rise of e-commerce between the United States and Europe, obviously delivery systems, air cargo, e-commerce purchases don't mean much if there are too many barriers in terms of delivery, whether it's in air cargo and other ways. And so, these are some of the issues that we hope to focus on.
There's also interest in not only the digital divides within our country, but in terms of the global digital divide, and this is an issue, again, we hope the discussion here will be a building block to discussions at the G-7 on ways that we could be facilitative if not in terms of support, at least in terms of information and assistance in helping developing countries think through their own strategies on telecommunications and digital divide.
Another area where we hoped to have this be a building block going at the G-8 is, as Sandy mentioned, in the infectuous disease area where we have very much had a framework, a framework that focuses on both providing the demand incentives in the future for new research on new drugs, in addition to focusing on purchase funds through the GAVI for more purchase of existing drugs that can cure existing diseases. Eighty percent of all AIDS deaths take place in Africa; this is clearly at the top of the crises in the world, and to the degree that this summit can help build, even be a building block for even greater attention at the G-7, that would be our hope.
Some of the specific things we are hoping to accomplish, we are hoping by the time we're there we will have finalized work on a safe harbor, from the EU directive on data protection. That vote will probably take place, literally, the day before we arrive. Also we are hoping, under so-called Madrid protocol, to make additional progress towards allowing our companies to file one EU-wide patent application, rather than having to file separate patent applications in each of the 15 EU countries.
And also, as last time, we made progress in government-to-government talks on the biotechnology issues, we're hoping to make progress in having more of an expert-to-expert forum to deal with this. We have not had a biotech product approved by the EU since 1998, and this is obviously an emotional issue, but we hope to continue the focus on having science-based solutions.
Unquestionably, any meeting between the United States and the EU will certainly deal with some of the major trade disputes that are between us. I think they're fairly well-known, in terms of beef and bananas and growing concern over subsidization issues with Air Bus. I'm sure that the FSC issue will also arise, where our Foreign Service Corporation tax provision had been found inconsistent with the WTO. Our Deputy Secretary Stu Eisenstat has already been in conversations with EU on possible WTO consistent solution that we have already tried to put forward.
Certainly, we will also talk about what are the hopes and possibilities of relaunching the WTO round that didn't quite make it in Seattle. There have been good discussions and I certainly think that when you look at the passage of the Caribbean CBI and Africa bill, it shows at least in one of the areas, which is efforts to show more openness on the developing countries' side -- we've made very tangible progress in the passage of that law.
The President, as Sandy said, will go on to Russia and Ukraine. Obviously, this will be a very interesting meeting because the economic issues are very front and central in Russia right now. Most people are expecting that Putin will put forward an economic plan if not by the end of this month, soon. I think they've even had a tax reform plan coming forward even as we speak right now, which is designed to lower rates and broaden the base.
Clearly, I think that Mr. Putin will want to discuss their plans for land reform, tax reform, need to improve shareholder rights. It really is a series of things which are the type of structural reforms that they are going to have to do to not only convince foreign investors, but more importantly, their own people that Russia is a place where one can safely put their funds, that it has the type of shareholder rights, the kind of enforcement of contract rights, bankruptcy rules that give people the security to put investments when they do see good ideas or profitable enterprises there.
Russia has had some good economic news lately. Some of that has certainly been the result of the rise in oil prices, which is obviously a main source of revenue for them. And as the ruble has weakened, it's made foreign imports more expensive, and so the Russian people have had to rely more on buying from the domestic producers within Russia.
But there have also been some good signs. Inflation, which was at 85 percent two years ago, is now predicted to be between 18 percent and 20 percent for this year. Their revenues, percentage of GDP of which their aim from the IMF had been 14 percent, may come in as high as 18 percent for this year, and if you actually looked at the last four quarters of growth in Russia, it would be up over 7 percent, which is not type of growth numbers that they have ever seen since the end of the Soviet Union.
After that, the President will go to Kiev for meetings with President Kuchma. Again, the economic agenda will be a significant issue. Ukraine's economy also declined sharply during the '90s, but has shown some positive signs. They're estimating growth at perhaps 1.3 percent, but there have been some people in the private sector, as Goldman-Sachs, who actually thought their growth could be closer to 3 percent.
Again, a lot of the same issues, particularly in the area of privatization. They have to, again, take some of these tests that will give people more confidence, particularly how they keep their accounting and books on the budgeting so people really have a clear and transparent view of what their budget is, and clearly they're going to have to obviously continue to cooperate with the IMF on the reserve management and transparency and other issues related to the problems that they had several years ago with their Central Bank.
With that, I will stop. And Sandy and I are available for questions.
Q: Sandy, two things. Do you expect that this will be the President's last trip to Europe, or do you anticipate him going back for anything during the final eight months in his presidency? And secondly, could you be more specific about what you expect in Russia in terms of any breakthrough or agreements on AMB, missile defenses and arms control?
MR. BERGER: We have no other trip to Europe that is now planned, but I wouldn't rule out the possibility that there would be a further trip for one reason or another between now and the end of the year.
With respect to ABM and START, I don't expect any resolution of this issue during this visit. This is the first time the President would have had an opportunity to discuss it with President Putin. He will describe for President Putin what we see as a new threat. I think almost everyone agrees there is, over some time horizon, the danger of long-range ballistic missiles from third countries that could reach the United States. We've developed, but not yet decided upon a limited national missile defense system that deals with the threats that are anticipated. We would like to do that in the context of an ABM treaty that is modified in some respects so that it strengthens arms control. And, in parallel, we would like to proceed on START III.
But I don't expect these issues will be resolved at this summit. I expect that it will be a good opportunity for us to explain our view of the problem, and for President Putin to express his view of the problem.
Q: Sandy, George W. Bush has suggested publicly that he would like the President not to make any kind of arrangements on arms control, it would tie the hands of a future President. Is that going to impinge at all on these talks in Moscow?
MR. BERGER: Let me say this. I think Presidents are elected by the American people to serve four-year terms, and I believe that they're expected to advance the national interest from day one until the final day. And I expect the President will do that. He will act in a way that he believes is in the national interest, and he will not do things that he doesn't believe are in the national interest.
That doesn't mean we will or will not reach an agreement. It doesn't mean -- as the President has said, he will decide later this summer whether he will -- whether we will go forward to deploy the limited system we have developed later this spring, based upon a number of criteria that you're aware of.
I guess I would simply point out that President Clinton's predecessor, President Bush, signed the START II treaty in December of 1992, after the 1992 election. And I think it was quite appropriate, because as I said, I think it -- the United States cannot afford to do business only three years out of four.
Q: How do you respond to the latest revelations that the national missile defense project is fundamentally flawed from a technical point of view?
MR. BERGER: Well, the President has said that he will make a decision later this year, based upon four criteria -- Number one, what is the nature of the threat. What is the nature of the threat of long-range ballistic missiles from North Korea later in the decade, potentially from Iran or Iraq? How serious is it? What is the time frame?
Number two, what is the technilogical feasibility of the system? We will have had some tests. There have been a number of issues raised. Initially, there will be another test in, it looks like now, the beginning of July. Presumably, there will be something called a defense readiness review; they'll make some recommendations to Secretary Cohen. He will make some recommendations to the President. So we'll look at all those questions.
Number three is what is the cost of the system, and how does that relate to other priorities. And number four, what is the overall effect of such a system on the national security in general -- not just on the immediate threat. So all of those issue are on the table. We will look at all of the information that is available to us at the time, and the President will make a decision as to whether to proceed.
Q: But if I might just follow up on that, sir, there is a respected body of opinion amongst academics who have looked at the date from the first round of tests, and who say, first of all, the data has been doctored, and second, that there is no technical way in which this can work. And you're about to spend, it seems, billions and billions of dollars on that.
MR. BERGER: That's about three editorial comments in that question. I would say, first of all, we will look at all of the information. I think there are differences of viewpoint on this, respected people I think on both sides of this argument. But we have not made a judgment. We will make a judgment based upon a very clear analysis of all of the information and all four of the factors I talked about.
What we have been talking about with the Russians over the last year is some modifications to the ABM treaty which would enable us to proceed with this limited system in a way that preserved the AMB treaty. I think that is in Russia's interests to do. But, as I say, we will make that decision later this year.
Q: When the President meets with Chancellor Schroeder in Germany, would he bring up the issue of parental custody and access to children?
MR. BERGER: I think there's no question that the issue will be raised. I don't want to -- I don't know whether it will be raised in this meeting or that meeting, but I think it's a serious issue. It's one that Secretary Albright raised with Foreign Minister Fischer recently. He went back on the basis of that, as I understand it, and asked for the formation of a commission from the Parliament to look into the issue. And it will be an issue that will be discussed while we're in Germany.
Q: Mr. Berger, you said that one of the topics the President will bring up with Mr. Putin is leakage of Russian technology to Iran. Could you describe for us how serious a problem that administration views that, and what specifically the administration will propose on trying to stop it?
MR. BERGER: Well, this is something that we've been working with the Russians on for a number of years. I worked on this with Secretary of the Security Council Putin three years ago, before his meteoric rise. I consider that kind of a role model -- National Security Advisor to President. (Laughter.) Only in terms of the career path. (Laughter.)
So we've been working on this for a long time. There are, clearly as central control of the Russian economy has broken up, there have been technology from Russia that has been obtained by Iran as part of their missile program and as part of their nuclear program. I should say that Iran's also gotten technology from others as well.
I think the Russians have taken a number of steps over this two- or three-year period to try to control particularly technology on proliferation -- leakage on the missile side. They've adopted an export control law, they have put essentially export control officers in major entities. We have sanctioned a number of entities of Russia that we believe were proliferating. The Russians have sanctioned a number of entities.
So I would say they have made progress, but there's still a problem. And it's one that obviously we can make more progress on if we work on together, and this is something that we will talking about.
Q: -- recommendations you will bring to the meeting?
MR. BERGER: There were a number of steps that were agreed to between Minister Koptev, who is the head of the space program in Russia, and Bob Gallucci, who is our Special Envoy for this -- dean at Georgetown. And they agreed to an agenda. And a number of the things on the agenda have actually happened. For example, the adoption of an export law. Some of the things on the agenda have not happened. I think we've got the prescription right, but I don't know that we have the implementation totally in place.
Q: Do you know about whether the President will be speaking with our allies about stepping up their role in U.N. peacekeeping operations, either in Kosovo or elsewhere around the world?
MR. BERGER: Well, we have had a very good collaboration with the Europeans in -- let's start with the Balkans. We're less than 15 percent of the force in Kosovo. Europeans and others are about 85 percent of the force. I don't remember exactly the percentages in Bosnia. I think we're below 20 percent. So they really have carried the lion's share of the peacekeeping in the Balkans. We want to see that. In Bosnia, that trend line is coming down rather dramatically over the past few years, but we still need to keep the force levels adequate.
In Kosovo, we don't want to see a drawdown that we think is
premature. Burden-sharing is very important to us in terms of the Europeans with respect to the Balkans. It was an issue, as you know, in the Congress this year. I think the Europeans have done quite well and we'll continue to urge them to do even more.
Q: Before the President leaves for Europe and Russia, what action do you think the U.S. is taking or will take to save the democracies in Sri Lanka and Fiji? And also, Pakistan, according to the intelligence reports, ready to test another bomb -- if any of these issues are going to come during his talks in Russia and elsewhere in Europe?
MR. BERGER: Let me say, first of all, we would view very unfavorably a further test by Pakistan. We don't have evidence that they intend to test, but it would be, obviously, a serious setback if they did, and I think a big mistake for Pakistan.
We are working with the U.N. and others on the very tragic problems in Sri Lanka that you mentioned. I think generally, I would expect South Asia to come up in -- one area that we'll talk about with Putin are regional issues. What can we do together to diffuse the situation in South Asia. How can we try to bring peace to some of the conflicts in Central Asia -- for example, the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh, where the French and us and the Russians are cochairs of the OSCE process to try to bring peace to that region.
So I think we'll have a discussion with President Putin and President Clinton about these regional conflicts in areas where we can cooperate.
Q: Mr. Berger, your original expectations -- the administration's expectations for this summit on arms control seemed to be much more optimistic at one time, and you've been forced to scale them back, apparently in the face of Russian --
MR. BERGER: I don't think we've scaled them back. I've never expected an issue as complex as this to be resolved in this summit. This is the first time that President Clinton will have an opportunity to discuss this. These are serious issues, and they involve both whether we can agree to modifications in the ABM treaty, whether we can make further progress on the START III process that President Yeltsin and President Clinton set as an objective in Helsinki in 1997.
But I think, hopefully, we will have some greater degree of understanding of each other's position which can lead, then, our folks to continue discussions between Moscow and subsequent meetings.
Q: What incentive is there for the Russians, given the calendar, given the fact that this administration has only months to run? What incentive is there for the Russians to agree to any deal this year at all, rather than waiting for the next --
MR. BERGER: I think they have to decide whether they want to reach an agreement now that will assure them that a limited NMD system will take place within -- bounded by -- within a ABM treaty that continues to maintain strategic stability, or whether they want the possibility that a future President might go forward with an NMD system, perhaps even more Star Wars-oriented NMB system, that would be more threatening to the Russians in the absence of an ABM treaty. That's a calculation they have to make.
Q: Sir, could you clarify -- I don't exactly understand the relationship between the NMD and the ABM treaty. I mean, is our position that it doesn't violate it, or that is does violate it, and we need to work --
MR. BERGER: No, I think there's no question that either the limited system that we have proposed, or even some of the other ideas that have been proposed in terms of sea-based systems, boost-phased systems, require a modification of the ABM treaty. And so, what we seek from -- what we would like to have from the Russians, what we'd like to see is their agreement to such a modification.
It is obviously not a prerequisite, but it, in our judgment, would be preferable to have a system -- to have this proceed in the context of an ABM treaty, which we believe does, in fact, contribute to strategic stability. And those, for example, who are saying we want a bigger NMD system, but lower numbers of START really are proposing two inconsistent things, because if you have a bigger NMD system, the Russians are going to build up, not build down. So I think we've struck a balance here which, hopefully, the Russians will see is in their interest, but that's what we'll see.
Q: Why is it okay, then, for us to violate treaties that we sign with other countries? I mean, I guess --
MR. BERGER: First of all, there's a provision in the ABM treaty whereby any party can, with six months notice, withdraw from the treaty. We're not proposing here today to violate the ABM treaty. We're saying to the Russians -- the ABM treaty actually provides for its amendment, and it has been amended once before. It's not something frozen in concrete back in 1972. It envisioned that there would be new threats that would have to be dealt with. And so it is not a violation of the ABM treaty to change the ABM treaty by mutual consent, so that if this President or a subsequent President decides to move ahead with a national missile defense system, it is bounded by an ABM treaty which will provide strategic stability.
Q: Do you expect any other agreements besides plutonium disposition -- agreement you will sign at Moscow summit? There were some reports that there can be a kind of a deal or at least some rather important decisions on commercial space launches.
MR. BERGER: Well, I think there will be discussion of space launches. Just to kind of explain that to your colleagues, we have a quota on the number of American satellites that can be launched on what is actually a Lockheed-Russian joint venture in Russia. The quota expires in December. We have to decide whether we continue it, whether we end it, whether we extend it. It is related to the non-proliferation issue that I was asked about before. There are some things that we have agreed with the Russians that we would do to help plug up the leaks of technology for Iran's missile program. And so our consideration of a larger quota or ending the quota is tied to our confidence that they are implementing their -- not their obligations -- that we are proceeding with strong partnershiop and cooperation on the non-proliferation side.
Q: On Northern Ireland, do you have a message to the Ulster Unionists as they prepare to take a critical vote there? And do you also have a comment -- a newspaper reports of divisions between the President and Tony Blair over the peace process.
MR. BERGER: First of all, the newspaper report is total, complete fiction, which is the nicest, kindest word that I could think of to describe it. It is absolute fabrication. There's nothing true in that article, except perhaps the by-line. (Laughter.)
Second of all, let me say, there's been very close cooperation between the President, Prime Minister Blair, the Taoiseach Bertie Ahern on this all the way through. I think that the Prime Minister and Prime Minister Ahern would be the first to acknowledge that. When they call and ask the President to do something, he almost invaribly does it. And when they ask his advise, he gives advise. Sometimes when they don't ask his advise, he gives advise. But it's been a genuine and I think quite extraordinary cooperation that's taken place.
In terms of the advise to the Unionists -- it's not my position to give to the Unionists. I would say only this. We are at an historic moment in Northern Ireland. We are very close to overcoming one of the final obstacles to really stabilizing and perpetuating the Good Friday Agreement. The IRA has come forward with a decommissioning initiative which we welcome, and I think it is extremely important that we now proceed with sensitivity to both communities, but with a view to the fact that the people of Ireland want peace.
Q: Did the President get briefed, perhaps by you, on this GAO exercise, where they got personnel and vehicles into federal buildings with phony passes, and do you see this as a national security threat?
MR. BERGER: He was not briefed by me about it. I don't know an awful lot about it myself, so I'll get back to you on it.
Q: The last time we visited Moscow, if I recall correctly, during the three days we were there, the currency collapsed about 30 percent. Has the Russian government actually taken any steps since then to improve the economic condition there, or are we simply hopeful that with Putin coming into power, they will take steps in the future to stabilize the economic situation?
MR. SPERLING: Well, I don't want to establish that there was a causal relationship between the President's trip and the -- I think the collapse was about 10-12 days before that. I think the real question is things have definitely improved there. Russia is very dependent on commodities, particularly oil and gas prices. As you know, oil prices have gone up significantly. That has increased their revenues very significantly.
Also, as the ruble has stayed very weak, that not only makes it easier to export, it makes it more expensive for the Russian people to import. And so they turn more -- where they might have bought a product, a foreign product, they start buying more domestic products. These two factors have clearly strengthened their budget situation, and strengthened their economy.
So I think the real question is whether this good period of economic times will just be something to rest on, or whether they will use it to make the more important structural reforms. And again, when I say the structural reforms, a point Secretary Summers always points out is the biggest problem with capital flight is not the capital flight of foreignors taking the money out, but the Russian people themselves who have significant -- I believe as much as $80 billion -- of capital flight.
And this is -- and why? It's because, in our country, if you're investing, you're wondering whether it's going to be a good investment; you may be wondering how the economy is going. You're not worried that somehow you won't have your rights protected in a shareholder dispute, or somehow bankruptcy laws won't apply, or that the contracts will not be protected.
These are all the type of more structural reforms that one has to make for Russia over time to become a place where people feel more confident in investing, a banking climate that focuses more on correct risk assessment. These are the important structural reforms.
I think if you -- several of us got to meet with, I guess, perhaps my counterpart yesterday -- I think if you look at the comments they've made, I think that they are saying the things that we would agree with was -- is most important. But I think the question is, one, will the proposals be there; and second, will there be the will and the capacity to get them through the Duma; and then will it be applied over a period of time so that there becomes more significant investment.
One thing that President Zedillo always tells other countries is that if you've had a bad period behind you, you can't simply do the right thing. You have to do the right thing, plus more to kind of erase the negative perceptions and build more confidence.
Q: -- breakthrough on beef and --
MR. SPERLING: I don't -- we would love to have a breakthrough, but I don't think there's tremendous reason for optimism. In fact, on beef, the Commission actually proceeded on May 24th with regulations continuing the ban, which I think was a negative and unfortunate step in the wrong direction.
Thanks.

Bill Clinton,"May 31, 2000",The President's News Conference With European Union Leaders in Lisbon,"Prime Minister Antonio Guterres. Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon. A few words in English before making my statement in Portuguese.
First of all, let me say that this was not a business-as-usual summit. It was a strategic summit: strategic in the way we discussed the diplomatic and security problems of our hemisphere, the new common security and defense policy of the European Union, its relationship with NATO, our relations with Russia and the Ukraine, our commitment to the protection of the values of all civilization in the Balkans; strategic in our approach, bringing confidence to multilateral way of dealing with trade issues, our commitment to relaunch this year the new round of World Trade Organization and to solve in a case-by-case situation our disputes based on the WTO rules; but especially strategic because we concentrated on the new global problems that represent today the main threats to our planet—infectious diseases like tuberculosis, malaria, or AIDS, the digital divide, the difficulties to make the new economy a truly inclusive economy; and strategic because we decided to work together, the United States and European Union, to promote a global effort to match this challenge and to win this challenge, aiming at the next G-8 organization summit and working together in all relevant international fora.
Ladies and gentlemen, this has indeed been a meeting in which questions of global strategy have been a major element. Firstly, on this level of diplomacy and security, I think that we have fully understood the importance of our common European security and defense policy and the interrelations between this policy and the instruments within it and NATO and in perfect accord with the relations between these two organizations.
We also discussed in a very consensual manner the efforts that the United States and the European Union are going to be making in their relations with Russia and the Ukraine, considering this an essential triangle for the stability of our continent.
And we were able to reiterate our firm commitment to what we are doing in the western Balkans and our conviction that what we are concerned with here are essential values of civilization—in Bosnia and Kosovo, as to the possibility there of establishing a real multiethnic community in this territory, and a commitment to transform Yugoslavia into a truly democratic country, commitment to guaranteeing or to trying to guarantee stability in such complicated areas as Montenegro, and to offer support to all the countries in the region in their development to offer a long-term prospect which is truly European for the whole Balkan region.
In our discussion, we attached great importance to the transformation of the new economy, the knowledge-based economy, not simply to be a privilege for the richest countries and for people and organizations with the greatest power in society but also, particularly in the United States and Europe, for all our citizens, for all our businesses, for all our organizations, and at the same time to establish a very strong interlinkage in our efforts with the objective of promoting a broadband link between our education information services on either side of the Atlantic.
We want to develop our common efforts to combat separation between rich and poor countries in this area, since we believe that this new economy is a basic and fundamental opportunity for the poorer countries to be able to press forward, to leap forward, and come closer to the living conditions of the more developed world.
But we can't talk about this without recognizing the drama which exists today in the world, given the series of infectious diseases leading to suffering and death for so many, such as AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. And we need to work together, seriously cooperating to promote global action to combat effectively these diseases and to develop in the next meeting of the G-8 an approach on this subject and to involve the whole international community and all international organizations, with the support of the European Union and the United States of America, in being catalysts in our efforts in this area. Given the global responsibilities we have, we must also meet these challenges of our times.
We also discussed many other questions—foreign policy, for instance—and of course, one point that the Portuguese Government cannot fail to mention: We talked about the transition of East Timor to democracy and independence.
President Clinton.
President Clinton. Thank you very much. First, I would like to thank Prime Minister Guterres for his outstanding leadership in his tenure as EU President. I thank President Prodi, Commissioner Patten, High Representative Solana, for their strong leadership and the work they have done for transatlantic cooperation, and especially in Kosovo and in the Balkans in these last few months.
I would like to just take one minute to put this meeting into some historical perspective. We've come quite a long way since Portugal's first EU Presidency 8 years ago. At that time, many were predicting that Europe's new democracies would falter, that Russia would turn inward and reactionary, that NATO had lost its reason for being, that Europe's project for a common currency and foreign policy would founder, and that the United States and Europe would go their own separate ways.
Eight years later Europe's new democracies are joining the transatlantic mainstream. Russia, for all its problems, has completed the first democratic power transfer in its entire history. We have preserved and strengthened NATO. The EU has brought monetary union into being and made a fast start at a common foreign and security policy, a development the United States strongly supports. And far from moving apart, the United States and Europe today complete the 14th U.S.-EU Summit of my Presidency. So I thank all of those who have supported those developments.
Today we talked a lot about security in Kosovo, the Balkans, southeastern Europe. We talked about the European Security Defense Initiative, which the United States strongly supports, in cooperation with NATO. And we talked about a number of other issues, including Russia, at some length. We discussed the need to support democracy and economic reform in Russia and the continued need for a political solution in Chechnya.
I'd also like to thank the European Union for something else which is on my mind today because of the work I've been doing in the Middle East. I welcome the efforts that the EU has led to give Israel an invitation to join the Western Europe and others group in the United Nations. This is a very good development, and I think it will contribute to the negotiating atmosphere that is so important at this difficult and pivotal time in the Middle East.
Just two other issues briefly. We did talk, as Prime Minister Guterres said, a lot about the new economy, about how to maximize its spread within our countries and how to bridge the digital divide both within and beyond our borders, and we talked about the importance of dealing with other common challenges. I'll just mention two. I talked at some length about the climate change/global warming challenge, and we have made a joint commitment to do more to try to help developing nations deal with AIDS, malaria, and TB. And I am very grateful for the leadership and the energy of the EU in that regard.
So, in closing, I think it's been a good meeting. I think it demonstrated the vitality and importance of our partnership. I'd like to thank the business leaders who are here, who also have been meeting, and the environmental leaders and just say that from my point of view, all these exchanges have been very much worth the effort and are leading us into a better future.
Thank you.
Prime Minister Guterres. Senor Prodi.
President Romano Prodi. Well, I am most pleased to be here today with Antonio to discuss with our common friend the President of the United States the relationship between the European Union and the United States.
But before anything, I want to pay tribute to the support of President Clinton to the European Union. You always supported European Union, without any doubt. And this is the reason why our transatlantic ties are so good now and so strong. And I think that—you will go to Aachen to receive the Charlemagne Prize. I think you deserve it because this is the prize that is given to the Europeans.
Your predecessor President Kennedy was a Berliner. You now, you are not a Berliner but a European, I'd say, because I think that you belong to our family, really. The United States helped Europe, even at the most difficult point, even when Europe was becoming more and more powerful, like making up a euro in the last building of our new Europe.
Now we are 375 million people; we shall arrive to 500 million people with enlargement. And we discussed enlargement this morning, and we discussed how enlargement can be performed quickly, well, in a peaceful way, not harming anybody, and being accepted also by Russia. This almost was a photo op of the meeting that I had with the Russian President Putin just the day before yesterday, discussing how enlargement would be done and the aim, the goals of enlargement.
Concerning the point you didn't touch in our relation, we discussed frankly about trade. And of course, conflicts between the two biggest trade powers in the world are always possible. We are the largest trade in the world, and we represent more than 40 percent of world trade.
We are committed, and we decided to be committed today to a more territorial trade system, and all trade disputes will be settled case by case under WTO rules. This was clear. There was a clear commitment. And we decided also that megaphone diplomacy will be replaced by telephone diplomacy. It is more constructive, even less sexy. [Laughter]
I am pleased that we have already two results of this cooperation. After 3 years of discussion, we are finally able to come today with a solution to settle our difference on that of protection, which is a very delicate issue. And then we developed jointly the safe harbor concept. And so we shall have, together, high data protection standards and free information flows.
This deal has been approved today by our member states and so will not be reviewed by the European Parliament. It's done. WTO accession of China will take place very soon, I hope— we hope. We are working for that, and we are— the two teams, the American, U.S. team and the European Union teams, are really working together for that.
And we launch today the biotechnology consultative forum to foster public debate and create more common understanding. I remember that this forum, which I proposed in October last year at my first meeting with you, Bill, is made of outstanding and independent individuals from outside the government. It's a very independent body. And I do expect that this forum will meet in July.
And so we agreed also to go together to the G-8 with a strong agenda on the tragic problem of sickness in the world. We shall elaborate this strategy for tuberculosis, malaria, and AIDS fighting over all the world. This is the agreement that we have today in a very good friendship environment.
And also, I want to add as the last reflection that—you talked about the Balkans—we know that together with the action, with the Stability Pact, with the progress that you are doing day by day, we must find a long-term solution in the idea of European Union spirit, in the European Union environment, in order to give a long-lasting solution to the Balkan problems.
Thank you.
National Missile Defense System
Q. Prime Minister Guterres and President Prodi, in a few months President Clinton will make a decision about a national missile defense system for the United States. For an American audience, can you explain any European concerns about deploying such a system and whether, in your just-completed trip to Moscow, President Putin expressed any flexibility about amending the ABM to allow such a system?
And President Clinton, in the system that you envision, would that allow for the missile protection system to protect Europe and our NATO Allies, as Governor Bush has suggested?
Thank you.
Prime Minister Guterres. Well, President Clinton was kind enough to inform us about what he thinks about the matter. I think he'll express that better than myself. I'd like to say that this is a matter in which the European Union has not an official position, but we have—I'll say all of us—a main concern. We live in the Northern Hemisphere where from bearing to bearing we want to have a strong security situation. We believe we have built a lot on the process to create that. And we believe that every new move to strengthen these must be as comprehensive as possible, as agreed by everybody as possible, and as corresponding as possible to everyone's concerns and to everyone's preoccupations in this matter.
President Prodi. Well, I have to add also that President Clinton—there was no yet precise proposal done. But we discussed it on the general principle that there was no decoupling, that there is no division between the two sides of the Atlantic. We are still and we are more and more joined together in our defense purpose, not only in our economic purposes. And so the spirit in which we judge the program—we didn't go into the details—was a constructive and friendly talk.
Q. And the Russian President?
President Prodi. No, the Russian President didn't touch the problem 2 days ago. The program was not on the agenda, and we didn't make any head to that.
President Clinton. First, let me just very briefly reiterate the criteria that I have set out for making a decision. First of all, is there a threat which is new and different? The answer to that, it seems to me, is plainly yes, there is, and there will be one; that is, the danger that states that are not part of the international arms control and nonproliferation regime would acquire nuclear weapons and the missiles to deliver them and that they might make them available to rogue elements not part of nation-states but allied with them. Secondly, is the technology available to meet the threat? Thirdly, what does it cost? Fourthly, what is the impact of deploying a different system on our overall security interests, included but not limited to arms control? So that is the context in which this decision must be made and why I have worked so hard to try to preserve the international framework of arms agreements.
Now, I have always said that I thought that if the United States had such technology, and if the purpose of the technology is to provide protection against irresponsible new nuclear powers and their possible alliances with terrorists and other groups, then every country that is part of a responsible international arms control and nonproliferation regime should have the benefit of this protection. That's always been my position.
So I think that we've done a lot of information sharing already with the Russians. We have offered to do more, and we would continue to. I don't think that we could ever advance the notion that we have this technology designed to protect us against a new threat, a threat which was also a threat to other civilized nations who might or might not be nuclear powers but were completely in harness with us on a nonproliferation regime, and not make it available to them. I think it would be unethical not to do so. That's always been my position, and I think that is the position of everyone in this administration.
NATO Enlargement
Q. Mr. President, for Portuguese Public Television, my name is Carlos Pena. In the middle of this month, in Lithuania, nine countries met, and they expressed their will to be part of NATO, and they want to work together. Did you address the question of further NATO enlargement and how you all see this kind of new ""big bang""?
President Clinton. Well, the short answer to your question is, we didn't talk about further NATO enlargement. But we have worked hard to try to make NATO relevant to the 21st century. We've taken in new members. We have had partnerships with dozens of new democracies, stretching all the way to central Asia. We have specific agreements with Ukraine and Russia. And I think we will have to continue to modernize the structure of NATO as we go along.
And I think more and more, the countries against whom NATO was once organized—that is, Russia and other members of part of the former Soviet bloc—will see NATO as a partner, not a former adversary, and you will see further integration and further cooperation. That's what I believe will happen.
European Union
Q. Yes, I'll start with Mr. President. Now that you are formally a European, considering Mr. Prodi has given you the qualification, I just wanted to ask you how do you feel about the position that's been expressed by some members of your administration that there is really not an adequate counterpart when they have to deal, for example, on economic and financial matters? That there is a Europe, but there are no ministers. Every 6 months you meet a different President of the European Union. Do you feel that it would be better for Europe as a whole to move further ahead into further integration, expressing better and with more determination their position?
And the same question is for Mr. Prodi and for Mr. Guterres. Mr. Prodi, I know you've been attacked and some people have been saying that Europe is really moving back into some kind of national environment, a national policy. Isn't that a negative development?
Thank you.
President Clinton. Well, first, I think it's entirely a question for Europeans to determine, how they should organize themselves and at what pace this integration should proceed. But if you look at the roles now occupied, for example, by Mr. Solana and Mr. Patten, if you look at the work that the EU has done to get our common endeavors energized in Kosovo, for example, just in the last few months, I think you have to say that the European Union is growing stronger, not weaker, and that it's growing more effective.
How you should proceed from here depends upon, I think, both the attitudes of the leaders as well as popular opinion and will be determined in no small measure by what the specific circumstances are confronting Europe in the next 4, 5 to 10 years.
But as an outsider, let me just say, I think that whenever something is in the process of being born, being formed, maturing, and you want to understand it and then explain it to other people, which is what your job is—since you're in the media, you have to first understand it and explain it to other people—there is always the tendency to see in any specific event evidence of a pattern which shows either that there's backsliding or accelerating, going forward. I think you have to resist that a little bit now because, really, history has no predicate for the European Union. Even the formation of the United States out of the various States is not the same thing. And we had quite a period of time before we had a National Government, when we were sort of a nation and we sort of weren't, when we were sort of together and we sort of weren't, in a much simpler time when the States had nothing like the history all the nations of Europe have.
So I think that we all have to have a little humility here and let this thing sort of unfold as history, popular opinion, and the vision of the leaders dictate. But I take it, from my point of view as an American, I think that so far all the developments, on balance, are very positive. I believe we want a strong and united Europe that is democratic and secure and a partner with us for dealing with the world's challenges of the future. So I think it's going in the right direction, and I think it's a very good thing.
President Prodi. Well, on my side, the answer is very simple. You know that the rotation of power is as ancient as ancient Rome, you know, and Rome became Rome and it began with the rotation of 6 months, as we are doing now. [Laughter] But I can also add there is a rotation of the President's Council, but there is no rotation of the President of the Commission. And so there is some stability in this, on this power.
But I will tell you something more, just a hint, joining what Bill Clinton told now—look, let's stay on the path. Let's stick on the facts. The enlargement, resting on the facts, never happened in history to put together 11 currencies, you know. Let's stick on the facts— never happen in history to enlarge this democratic process as we are doing now.
I'm touring every day in the new applying countries. And to see 12 parliaments working day and night to apply the new legislation, to conform to the European legislation, is something that it makes different with history. This is what is happening now. And so I am not only confident that Europe is strong, but Europe will be the real new event of the democracy of the 21st century.
Prime Minister Guterres. If I may add something. I think we have achieved a lot, but we are not satisfied. We are going on. We have an intergovernmental conference taking place now to improve our efficiency in decisionmaking, our democracy, our transparency, and to make sure we'll be able to cope with enlargement and, at the same time, to deepen our integration.
And if one looks back at the recent Lisbon extraordinary summit, I have to recognize that I, myself, was not expecting the European Union to be able to take so many policy decisions in so many relevant matters in such a quick frame of time, which proves that when we want—when we have the political will to do that, we really can have good decisions, quick decisions, and can find the right path.
So I'm very optimistic about the future of Europe, and I think my optimism is shared by all those that want to join the European Union at this moment.
Middle East Peace Process
Q. Mr. President, it's been a very busy couple of weeks in the Middle East, as you know. I'm wondering whether what's happened there recently has created any new opportunities for the peace process, what dangers it might have raised, and whether anything that's happened there has given you new hope that the September 13th deadline for a Palestinian-Israeli agreement will be reached?
President Clinton. Well, I think the decision of Prime Minister Barak to withdraw the Israeli troops from southern Lebanon, in accordance with the United Nations resolution, was, first of all, a daring one which creates both new challenges and new opportunities. It changed the landscape. And from my point of view, it imposes on—it should impose, at least, on all parties a greater sense of urgency, because things are up in the air again. So there is an opportunity, to use a much overworked phrase, to create a new order, to fashion a new peaceful order out of the principles of the Oslo accord and all that's been done in the year since.
But from my point of view, it also imposes a much greater sense of urgency. I think the consequences of inaction are now likely to be more difficult because of this move. And so— for example, you have now—just for example, you talked about the Palestinians. I think this will heighten the anxieties of the Palestinians in Lebanon. Does this mean that there is going to be a peace and, therefore, they will be able to have a better life, either going home or going to some third country, going to Europe, going to the United States? Or does this mean that this is it, and there is sort of a new freezing of the situation? So there is anxiety in that community. You see that in every little aspect of this.
I think, on balance, it's good, because I believe they are going to reach an agreement. But it both turns the tension up in all camps and increases the overall price of not reaching an agreement fairly soon and the overall reward of reaching an agreement fairly soon. It changes everything in a way that both increases the pluses and increases the potential minuses. That's my analysis.
Q. President Clinton, sir, can you confirm if it's true that tomorrow you will meet in Lisbon with Prime Minister from Israel Ehud Barak?
President Clinton. Yes. I will, and I'm going to talk to Mr. Arafat before that, sometime today.
Yes.
Indonesia
Q. Mr. President, I'm from Indonesia. Since in the senior level group it was mentioned the coordinated support for the President, Wahid, and Indonesian Government, how do you feel the political and economic development in Indonesia?
Thank you.
President Clinton. Well, first, I think it's worth pointing out that it's the largest Muslim country in the world, one of the handful of nations which will determine much of the shape of the 21st century the next 30 or 40 years by whether it does well or does poorly. So I think that everything that has been done to try to stabilize the country politically and get back to economic growth is a plus.
And I suppose, like any outsider, my only wish is that more could be done more quickly, because so many people within Indonesia's lives are at stake, and the rest of us, we really need you to succeed.
Prime Minister Guterres. If I may say something that might sound surprising to you—probably before this press conference ends, our Minister of Foreign Affairs will fly to Jakarta. And under the Portuguese Presidency of the European Union, it will be held, the first political dialog between Indonesia and the European Union. And that also shows the attachment we have in the European Union for democracy, peace, and stability in Indonesia.
Russia
Q. The New York Times. Mr. Prime Minister, Mr. President, could you share with us your impressions of President Putin and the extent to which you see any prospects for some flexibility on a political solution in Chechnya? And President Clinton, could you kindly expand a bit on your discussions today about Russia? And on the eve of your trip to Russia, do you foresee any progress on any bilateral issue, including arms control, Chechnya, corruption?
Prime Minister Guterres. Well, in our last meeting in Moscow, I must say that I was quite impressed by President Putin's determination in creating in Russia a democratic state based on the market economy and rule of law. It was also clear, from our point of view, that even if our views about Chechnya are different, he said—and he said publicly—that he was committed to a political solution. And he also announced his firm support to the inquiries to be made by an independent committee, his will to see the OSCE back, and to give better support to international organizations involved in humanitarian help. And he even stressed in the press conference that there would be people prosecuted for violations of human rights in Chechnya.
So even if this does not correspond entirely to what we think, it really shows a move and a step which I believe is in a positive direction.
President Prodi. I confirm that there was a precise engagement on concrete decision to make inspections and transparency more visible in Chechnya for the immediate weeks, for the time that is in front of us.
Last question.
President Clinton. Wait, she asked me a question. Let me just say this, to start with a negative and end with a positive, I would be surprised if we bridge all of our differences on Chechnya, and I would be surprised if we resolved all of our differences on the question of missile defense, although we might make more headway than most people expect. I'm just not sure yet.
However, I do expect that there will be two or three other areas where we will have truly meaningful announcements that I think will make a real difference—one of them, in particular, we're working on it. If we get it done, it will be very, very important.
So I think the trip is well worth it, and even in the areas where we may not have an agreement, in some ways that may be the most important reason for the trip of all. We shouldn't only do these trips and these dialogs when we know we've got a guaranteed outcome. Sometimes it's most important to be talking when there's still unresolved differences.
Upcoming Meeting With Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel
Q. Mr. President, can you please explain the timing and reasoning behind your visit tomorrow with Barak and tell us what you hope to accomplish?
President Clinton. Yes. They have—first of all, all the balls are up in the air as I just explained, and so there is both greater potential for something happening and also greater tension in the atmosphere, which is causing a ripple effect in the relationship between the Israelis and the Palestinians.
Secondly, Mr. Barak and Mr. Arafat have set for themselves an earlier timetable, as you know, to reach a framework agreement—not a final agreement; that's supposed to be done in September—but an earlier one. And there are lots of things that need to be gone through that we need to go through if we're even going to reach the framework agreement, because a lot of the toughest things have to be—they'll have to come to grips with those just to reach the framework agreement.
So I have been looking for an opportunity to meet with Prime Minister Barak. As you know, he was supposed to come to the United States a few days ago, and because of developments in the region, he could not come. Then he was going to come to Germany and participate in an event to which he was invited anyway, and we were going to talk, and then he couldn't do that because of a holiday in Israel. So this was the only shot we had to do it and still have enough time to meet the deadline that both he and Mr. Arafat are trying to meet.
There's no—you shouldn't overread this. It's not like there's some bombshell out there. But we just really needed to have a face-to-face meeting, and we needed to do it in this timeframe. He couldn't come last week to the United States. Then he couldn't come to Berlin to the meeting to which he was also invited. So we're doing the best we can with a difficult situation.
Prime Minister Guterres. Ladies and gentlemen, I must confess I have enjoyed some time ago, very much, a picture called ""NeverEnding Story,"" but I don't think we can repeat that picture and transform this press conference in a new version. So, thank you very much, all of you.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-european-union-leaders-lisbon
Bill Clinton,"June 01, 2000",Press Briefing by National Security Advisor Sandy Berger,"Crowne Plaza Hotel
Berlin, Germany
9:38 P.M. (L)
MR. LOCKHART: Good evening, everyone. Mr. Hunt. The President's National Security Advisor, Samuel Berger, will brief you on the meeting that the President just held with Chancellor Schroeder and give you a sense of the important events of tomorrow, highlighted by the President receiving the Charlemagne Prize. He will take some questions, and if there are any other areas you want to discuss, I'll be glad to take further questions.
MR. BERGER: Good evening. The meeting between President Clinton and Chancellor Schroeder lasted I think about 90 minutes, scheduled for about 45. There were three basic issues they talked about, after the initial greetings. The first was Russia, our impending to there and Putin is coming here I think sometime later this month. They talked about the opportunities that a Putin administration offered, as well as some of the concerns that they had.
I think they both see Putin as likely to be the President of Russia for the next four years, and therefore, an extraordinarily important figure in terms of not only the history of Russia, but the evolution of East-West relations, or relations between Russia and Europe, Russia and the United States.
Their view is that he clearly seems committed to modernizing the Russian economy, which is the fundamental task before him -- or a fundamental task before him -- and that in so doing, if he's successful, notwithstanding the rather formidable obstacles he faces, that he can bring the very dramatic changes that have taken place in Russia over the last decade more directly to the Russian people and, therefore, put democracy on an even more stable footing going forward.
Obviously, there are concerns. They talked about Chechnya and the continuing imperative of bringing this to a political end, rather than a continued military engagement; and the challenge of Putin -- the issue of whether modernization that I talked about will reinforce democratization or whether it will come at the expense of democratization. Those are all questions that obviously will be answered by President Putin and the Russian people over the months ahead.
They had a good discussion on NMD. The President talked about, first, about the choices before him as we proceed. They talked about the nature of the threat -- that is, the development of the capability of a third country, some hostile, perhaps ultimately subnational units having long-range missile capabilities that can reach the United States, how we best deal with that threat. They talked about the challenges of the technology, other technological ideas that have been floated; about the broad security consequences of both proceeding and not proceeding, including the impact of arms control.
Clearly, as we said before, it is our strong preference to proceed, if the President so decides, in the context of the arms control regime, and the President made that clear to Chancellor Schroeder. Schroeder acknowledged that this is a sovereign decision for the United States government and the United States people to make. He expressed his concern that we proceed with due consideration for the impact on others, including Europe, assuming, of course, that we intend to do.
I think it was a good discussion, it was a very substantive discussion, and I think that -- I would hope that there is a better understanding, having listened to that discussion, on the part of the German government that we are proceeding with care and with deliberation through all of the dimensions of this.
The President then raised the child custody issue and his concern about this problem, which has gained attention in the United States. The Chancellor said that he had been looking at these cases, that he was, of course concerned from his perspective about not interfering with the judicial process, particularly given the historical precedence here, but that he recognized that some cases did raise problems.
He proposed a group of experts from both countries that would sift through each of the individual cases that are at issue, and also look to, prospectively, what kind of institutional changes perhaps are necessary to make the system work better. This, I think, represents a good step. The terms of reference of this group of experts remains to be determined, and will be worked out between our justice ministers. The President's concern here is that the Hague Convention, which provides certain rights in these cases be adhered to to the greatest extent possible. Not only here, but in other countries, and also in the United States, where in some cases it has not been adhered to, I think, although it is a much smaller number of cases.
Let me just foreshadow tomorrow a little bit, and then take your questions. The Charlemagne Prize, which the President is receiving tomorrow for his contribution to peace and integration of Europe, and the partnership between Europe and the United States, is something we value highly, the President values highly. I think you heard EU President Prodi yesterday talk about the importance of this prize and what it represents in Europe, indicating this made the President an honorary European. Chancellor Schroeder today again in the meeting expressed his pleasure that this was happening and how important this was in a European context. I think for Europeans and for us I think it's a big deal.
The prize -- this is the 50th anniversary of the Charlemagne Prize, although it's only been given 40 times in 50 years. Some years, I guess, there was no worthy recipient. I think you've been told before some of the previous recipients -- Jean Monet; Adenauer; Churchill; Mitterrand; Kohl; Havel, who I believe will be there tomorrow; King Juan Carlos, who I think also will be there; and Tony Blair. The President is only the third American to receive the prize -- George Marshall and Henry Kissinger being the other two.
Aachen, itself, is a very interesting location. I'm sure you know, it's the ancient capital of Charlemagne and has been, in a sense, the heart of the European identity for about 12 centuries. The city was severely damaged during World War II, although the cathedral remained intact. In 1944, Aachen was the first German city liberated by the U.S. armies. There was enormous, deep and long historical resonance to not only the location of the price, but, obviously, the prize itself.
And the President will give an address and talk about where we've come in realizing the vision that he's spoken of quite frequently over the last eight years of a peaceful, undivided, democratic Europe, for the first time in history -- where we are on that, toward that end, and the remaining tasks ahead; in particular, Southeastern Europe and integrating it into Europe as the way of anchoring it into the democratic world and the peaceful world; second, Russia and how it evolves over the next decade and more; and then, third, the durability and continued importance of the transatlantic alliance.
The President will talk a bit about some perceptions and misperceptions on both sides of the Atlantic, but the abiding and strong continuing interest that we have in maintaining the strength of that alliance is essentially the bedrock of American foreign policy, and I think European foreign policy.
Q: In diplospeak, your description of --
MR. BERGER: Diplo-speak? That was Joe you were referring to.
Q: Your discussion of the national missile defense sounded like a pretty sharp disagreement. Could you elaborate on what they discussed? And did they in the end just agree to disagree, or where does this --
MR. BERGER: Was that in reporto-speak? (Laughter.) No, I don't think it was a sharp disagreement. I think it was a very intelligent discussion of a very complicated issue by two very smart men, and a result of which I think both learned something. That's how I would describe it. That's not diplo-speak.
I think it was not at all sharp. It was the President saying, let me tell you how I'm thinking about this, what are the issues that I've got to deal with. We can't run away from this threat, it's there. How quickly it will evolve, what is the right way to answer it and deal with it, those are all very legitimate questions. But we can't bury it, we can't put our head in the sand. Here are the choices and here are the factors that I'm going to take into account, and I'm concerned about how we proceed with Europe and their sense of comfort level with this. But, ultimately, I've got to make a decision in terms of American national security.
I think on Schroeder's part, I think that he said that -- as I said before, they're concerned that this not be done at the expense of the arms control regime or without regard to its impact on others. And, of course, those are all factors the President has said that he will take into consideration.
Q: What's your perception of the threat that and MND would provoke any kind of an arms race?
MR. BERGER: Well, I think that the system that we have developed -- although I would say again, not yet decided whether to go forward with -- is a very limited system. It is a system that does not, from any reasonable perspective, threaten the Russian deterrent. It's not designed against China and we do not believe it will negate China's nuclear deterrent going forward.
So we don't think that a limited system, particularly if we proceed here in the context of a modified ABM treaty, as we proceed forward with a START III process, would ignite an arms race. I think there are other regimes that might be more -- run more of a risk.
But this is a system that is not directed at Russia; this is a system that is directed at Saddam Hussein or North Korea or others who may acquire, or who are acquiring, long-range missiles. And we have an obligation to the American people to think through very carefully how best we respond to that.
Q: Will the President modify his approach to Putin on this subject based on what he heard today and learned today in the meeting with Schroeder?
MR. BERGER: I think you learn something from every encounter. But I don't think fundamentally it will change the dialogue. I think that this, as I said before, is the first opportunity and Putin will have to talk to each other about this. I think it's important that President Putin hear from President Clinton how we see the threat, how we see the system, why we don't see it as a threat to Russia.
I expect that President Putin will express his concerns about it and I don't expect they'll resolve all differences, but I hope that there will be a better appreciation of this as a result of the meeting which, of course, has a number of other areas of concentration as well.
Q: Did they talk about the Holocaust slave labor?
Q: Will President Clinton offer to share American missile defense technology with Russia when he speaks with Putin?
MR. BERGER: I think that for some time we have said that we're prepared to cooperate in some respects with Russia in ways that would be stabilizing. For example, just to give you one example, early warning information which, if Russia has a greater capability to understand what may be being launched into the air, it will make decisions that will be safer and more secure for us. So there are plenty of areas of cooperation. Conceivably, we have not decided to go forward. Conceivably, there are areas where, as the President suggested yesterday, we can share some technology, presumably other technology we would not be able to share.
Q: On the ABM Treaty, you said that Schroeder expressed concern that any missile defense not be done at the expense of the arms control regime. Is he asking for upholding the ABM Treaty as is; does he still believe this is a viable treaty?
MR. BERGER: No, I don't think -- it was not expressed at that level of detail. I think that the ABM Treaty envisioned by its own terms that it would be amended and, in fact, it has been amended. It was amended in 1974. So it's not like the Ten Commandments written in stone; it is a document that, by its own terms, provides for amendments and changes to deal with the evolution of circumstance.
What we're simply saying to the Russians is that there have been an evolution of circumstance, and we ought to think about this in a way that both enables us to deal with this threat, but also in a way that preserves both an ABM Treaty, although with some modifications, and as we proceed down the START road.
Q: So what did he mean when he said that it shouldn't be done at the expense of the arms control regime, what was he referring to?
MR. BERGER: I think the Europeans would not be excited if the United States unilaterally abrogated the ABM Treaty. But that is certainly a right that we retain, and it is something the President ultimately may have to decide. But it is our strong preference, if we proceed -- and no decision to go forward has been made -- to do so in the context of arms control.
Q: When you said that you might share some technology, but not other technology -- yesterday, the President suggested a pretty strong moral imperative saying it would be unethical, it would be a moral obligation to share it --
MR. BERGER: I think you have to -- it depends on what. If we had a system and we determined that the missile had been launched -- not at us, but at somebody else -- I presume if it was launched at Europe, we would have a moral obligation to tell Europe, to inform them what we knew.
To the extent that we could share information and share technology, not only in that circumstances -- which, obviously, is an extreme circumstance -- but that gives them greater capacity of benefit from this system, that's something that we will look at. But, again, I think it's premature to be too specific about this, since we haven't yet made those judgments.
Q: But did Schroeder express any interest in Germany or other European nations obtaining the technology as a part of a system providing defense for itself, for all of Europe?
MR. BERGER: You know, Europeans are not -- to take it out of the Schroeder context -- are not impervious to the threat that we're talking about. Many of the Europeans I've talked to recognize that this is a problem. I don't think they're far along in their thinking to determine what the right solution for them is. And, obviously, a lot depends upon how we proceed.
Q: Stu Eizenstat had suggested two days ago that he was hopeful that an agreement on Holocaust slave labor fund would be -- a German fund -- would be perhaps signed by the two men during this visit to Germany. Did they discuss that subject and how close are they to an agreement? And is there any thought about having American firms that benefited from slave labor also start a fund of their own?
MR. BERGER: I would rather that we find Stu, Joe --
Q: Did the issue come up?
MR. BERGER: The issue did not come up, and I have not had a chance to talk to Stu in the last 24, 36 hours, so I'm not exactly sure where this stands, and I'm reluctant to suggest there will or there won't be an agreement. When I last spoke to Stu it was not -- there were still issues to be resolved. It did come up in the context of, I think, a commitment on the part -- it came up particularly in the meeting with President Rau in the context of a desire of both countries to resolve this, recognizing there were still some legal issues that had to be resolved.
Q: What about with Schroeder?
MR. BERGER: I don't think it came up with Schroeder, no.
Q: On the custody issue, did they discuss how they might expedite contacts between American parents who have not been able to see their children in Germany? And, also, who would be these experts that they're talking about?
MR. BERGER: Well, again, this is a new idea that Chancellor Schroeder put on the table today, after the President raised this issue. And I think we're going to have to now have serious discussions on what the nature of this group would be and what their mandate would be, what their authority would be.
We did talk about visitation rights, specifically, and the suffering of parents who can't even see their children. I think, clearly, that is something that this group could look at in individual cases. But exactly how -- what their mandate will be, what their authority will be, other than the very general one at this point of -- or generic one -- of looking through all the cases, presumably determine where there are problems; and, second, recommending changes that can be made in the system to expedite resolution of these cases on a fair basis consistent with the Hague Convention. Beyond that, that really now has to go to, I think, the justice ministers to work out.
Q: Can you say something more about these transatlantic misconceptions that the President is going to tell the world about tomorrow?
MR. BERGER: Well, I don't want to -- I mean, two I'll just mention -- perceptions or misperceptions I think is what I said. One, on the European side, I think there is often some resistance to what they perceive as overwhelming American power and American unilateralism in some cases. I think many Americans are concerned about burden-sharing issues in situations like the Balkans. The facts in many cases are different than the perceptions, and I think the President wants to address those.
Q: In the conversation on Chechnya, will there be anything new or different that Schroeder or the President will have to say about the situation there to achieve the result which you said they both favor, which is moving this toward a political and away from a military solution?
MR. BERGER: Well, that's the headline version. I'm sure that it will be more specific than that. Clearly, number one, we would like to see an end to this. There are still lives being lost in Chechnya and our view -- and it's been our view since the President met with Putin in Auckland -- has been that this can only come to a resolution through some kind of political settlement.
Second of all, there are questions of human rights issues that have been raised, questions of accountability and process and access by the international community. I think those will be questions that will be raised in Moscow.
Q: You said that the two learned something from each other in the discussion. What did the President learn from Schroeder -- technological aspects -- and did it change his perception at all about this thing going forth?
MR. BERGER: Well, I think we certainly have had enough conversations with the Europeans over the past months to know the issues that they raised. I thought Chancellor Schroeder raised those issues. And, as I say, we also would like to do this, if we do it at all, in the context of arms control in ways that are sensitive to the impacts on our allies.
Q: On Sierra Leone, you guys released from the White House today a memorandum from the Secretary of State showing that President Clinton has made an official presidential determination that furnishing support for the peacekeeping efforts there is important to the security interests of the United States. Is that prelude simply to furnishing logistical support, or do you envision some larger role for the United States that this would give us a legal basis to implement?
MR. BERGER: I think that is in connection -- I'm not specifically familiar with the piece of paper that you have in front of you, but I think that is in connection with our readiness, as we've said before, to work with regional countries -- Nigeria, in particular; Ghana and others -- in helping them to deploy to Sierra Leone, to enhance the peacekeeping mission there, to do so with as good equipment and training as is possible. So I think our role would be logistical, as well as, perhaps in the area of training and assistance, but not in any kind of a combat capacity.
Q: Sandy, is there a risk that Putin might view the President's decision as something of an ultimatum, either accept a renegotiation or the ABM treaty or we could exercise our right to withdraw from it?
MR. BERGER: No, I don't think we've ever presented anything as an ultimatum. The fact is that we have a threat. We have developed a system. We have to make a judgment whether the technology is sufficiently far along to have confidence in it. We would like to do that in the context of arms control. It is clearly in the interest of Russia that if a limited NMD system goes forward -- let alone a Star Wars kind of system -- that it be done in the context of arms control.
And so I think this will not be presented as an ultimatum. It will be presented as a set of issues that the Russians have to make their own judgment about, in terms of what their -- how they see their interests. Would they like to see this -- is it better for them for this to proceed in the context of a modified ABM treaty, or run the risk that this President or a subsequent President might build this system or a larger system outside the context of the ABM Treaty?
Q: Sandy, any response to the -- by North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il to China?
MR. BERGER: Well, like our South Korean allies, we welcome this development. It reflects -- I believe it's the first visit by a North Korean leader to China in well over a decade. And anything that brings North Korea out of isolation and into contact with other nations is a good development.
Obviously, we look forward very much to the North-South summit, which will take place June 12th to 14th. I think that is a truly historic meeting, and I think as part of that, you're seeing some of this other diplomatic activity take place.
Thank you.
MR. LOCKHART: Do you guys have anything else you want to cover?
Q: Joe, will the President today or sometime tomorrow send a notification to Congress about the drug kingpin situation --
MR. LOCKHART: Well, we have a statutory deadline of June 1, and I expect that we will meet that deadline.
Q: So it will be something tonight?
MR. LOCKHART: Well, I don't think we'll be doing anything as far as keeping you up until the middle of the night, so I expect if we have something, it may be for tomorrow. If we have something to send to Congress, it will be done today or tomorrow, I expect.
Q: Can you give us any kind of tick-tock on how the President was notified about the Elian decision? Did he read it in its entirety or --
MR. LOCKHART: No, I don't think he's had a chance to read it in its entirety. We were notified of the decision as we were landing in Berlin. We had just finished briefing the President on the trip here, and Deputy Counsel Bruce Lindsey and myself went to the front, told him of the decision, what we knew about it. We have subsequently gotten the opinion over here. Bruce has read it; he gave the President a little fuller briefing later in the day. But he hasn't had a chance in between all these meetings to sit down and read it.
Q: And the President mentioned it in his -- when he came out of the meeting with Schroeder. Did you happen to know if he mentioned it in the meeting with --
MR. LOCKHART: Not really in the meeting. He mentioned as they were walking out of the meeting to Chancellor Schroeder that because this was such a big domestic story in the States, he would be saying something about it. There was no discussion of it, but as a matter of courtesy, he mentioned to Chancellor Schroeder that he would be making a few brief comments on this at the end of his statement.
Q: Joe, when is the President meeting with former Chancellor Kohl?
MR. LOCKHART: Do we have a time on that? Let me get a time for you. Tomorrow, but I'll have to get a time for you for that.
Q: Are they going to have lunch? (Laughter.)
MR. LOCKHART: I'm not sure we have that much time in the schedule. (Laughter.)
THE PRESS: Thank you.

Bill Clinton,"June 02, 2000","Remarks on Receiving the International Charlemagne Prize in Aachen, Germany","Ladies and gentlemen, Chancellor Schroeder, Lord Mayor Linden, President Rau, President Havel, His Majesty Juan Carlos, President Halonen, previous laureates, members of the Charlemagne Foundation, leaders of the clergy and cathedral, and members of the German and American Governments. Let me begin by thanking the lord mayor for his welcome and his wise words and my good friend Chancellor Schroeder for his kind comments and his visionary statement.
The rare distinction you have bestowed upon me, I am well aware, is in large measure a tribute to the role the American people have played in promoting peace, freedom, and security in Europe for the last 50 years. I feel the honor is greater still because of the remarkable contributions made by previous recipients of this prize toward our common dream of European union.
Of course, as has already been said, that dream has its roots here in Aachen, an ancient shrine that remains at the center of what it means to be European, the seat of an empire, a place of healing waters, peace treaties, furious fighting. With its liberation at the end of World War II, Aachen became perhaps the first German city to join the postwar democratic order. Today, as I have seen, Aachen is both a sanctuary for sacred relics dating back to the dawn of Christianity and a crucible of Europe's new information economy.
Here, Charlemagne's name summons something glimpsed for the first time during his life, a sense that the disparate people of this Earth's smallest continent could actually live together as participants in a single civilization. In its quest for unity, even at the point of a sword, and in its devotion to the new idea that there was actually something called Europe, the Carolingian idea surpassed what had come before, and to an extent, it guides us still.
Twelve centuries ago, out of the long, dark night of endless tribal wars, there emerged a light that somehow has survived all the ravages of time, always burning brighter, always illuminating Europe's way to the future. Today, that shining light of European union is a matter of the utmost importance, not just to Europeans but to everyone on this planet, for Europe has shown the world humanity at its best and at its worse. Europe's most violent history was caused by men claiming the mantle of Charlemagne, men who sought to impose European union for their own ends without the consent of the people. History teaches, therefore, that European union, not to mention transatlantic unity, must come from the considered judgment of free people and must be for worthy purposes that when threatened must be defended.
The creators of this prize and its first winners clearly understood that. We often say that theirs was the generation that rebuilt Europe after World War II, but actually they did far more. They built the foundation of something entirely new, a Europe united in common commitment to democracy, free markets, and the rule of law. That achievement endured for half a century, but only for half a continent.
Then, 11 years ago, the Berlin Wall fell, the Iron Curtain parted, and at last the prospect of a Europe whole and free opened before you. All of us will remember 1989 for the Wall crumbling to the powerful strains of Schiller's ""Ode to Joy."" It was a moment of great liberation, like 1789 or 1848, a particular triumph for the German people, whose own unification defied great adversity and set the stage for the larger unification of Europe.
Too often we forget that 1989 was also a time of grave uncertainty about the future. There were doubts about NATO's future, reinforced later by its slowness to confront evil in Bosnia and Croatia. There were fears that the EU's efforts to come closer together would either fail or, succeeding, would fatally divide Europe and the United States. The countries of Central and Eastern Europe feared becoming a gray zone of poverty and insecurity. Many wondered if Russia was headed for a Communist backlash or a nationalist coup.
In January of 1994 I came to Europe for the first time as President, both to celebrate Europe's new birth of freedom and to build upon it. Then I spoke of a new conception of European security, based not on divided defense blocs but instead on political, military, and cultural integration. This new security idea required, as has already been said, the transatlantic alliance to do for Europe's East what we did for Europe's West after World War II.
Together, we set about doing that. We lowered trade barriers, supported young democracies, adapted NATO to new challenges, and expanded our Alliance across Europe's old divide. We made clear, and I repeat today, that NATO's door remains open to new members. The EU took in three new members, opened negotiations with a dozen others, created a single market with one currency.
We've stood by Russia, struggling to build their own democracy, and opened the way to a partnership between Russia and NATO and between Ukraine and NATO. We defended the values at the heart of our vision of an undivided Europe, acting to stop the ethnic cleansing in Bosnia and forging what I believe will be an enduring peace there.
We acted in Kosovo in one of our Alliance's finest moments. A year ago in Germany we launched a Stability Pact for southeastern Europe. We stand, still, with crusaders for tolerance and freedom, from Croatia to Slovakia to Serbia. And we do encourage reconciliation between Turkey and Greece.
Over the last 11 years, of course, there have been some setbacks. But unquestionably, Europe today is more united, more democratic, more peaceful than ever, and both Europeans and Americans should be proud of that.
Think how much has changed. Borders built to stop tanks now manage invasions of tourists and trucks. Europe's fastest growing economies are now on the other side of the old Iron Curtain. At NATO Headquarters the flags of 19 Allies and 27 partners fly. In Central Europe and Eastern Europe, the realistic dream of membership in the EU and NATO has sparked the resolution of almost every old ethnic and border dispute. And, finally—finally—our friend Va´clav Havel has spent more years being President than he spent in prison.
In southeastern Europe, the Bosnians are still fighting, but now at the ballot box. Croatia is a democracy. Soldiers from almost every European country, including bitter former adversaries, are keeping the peace together in Kosovo. Last year as German troops marched through the Balkan countryside, they were hailed as liberators. What a way to end the 20th century.
In the meantime, Russia has stayed on the path of democracy, though its people have suffered bitter economic hardships, political and criminal violence, and the tragedy of the war in Chechnya, which yet may prove to be selfdefeating because of the civilian casualties. Still, it has withdrawn its troops from the Baltic States, accepted the independence of its neighbors, and completed the first democratic transition in its thousand-year history.
European unity really is producing something new under the Sun, common institutions that are bigger than the nation-state and, at the same time, a devolution of democratic authority downward. Scotland and Wales have their own Parliaments. This week Northern Ireland, where my family has its roots, restored its new government. Europe is alive with the sound of ancient place names being spoken again, Catalonia, Piedmonte, Lombardy, Silesia, Transylvania, Uthenia, not in the name of separatism but in the spirit of healthy pride and heritage.
National sovereignty is being enriched by lively local voices making Europe safer for diversity, reaffirming our common humanity, reducing the chance that European disunity will embroil Europe and America in another large conflict.
One thing, thankfully, has not changed. Europe's security remains tied to America's security. When it is threatened, as it was in Bosnia and Kosovo, we, too, will respond. When it is being built, we, too, will always take part.
Europe's peace sets a powerful example to other parts of the world that remain divided along ethnic, religious, and national lines. Even today, Europe has internal disputes over fundamental questions of sovereignty, political power, and economic policy, disputes no less consequential than those over which people still fight and die in other parts of the world. However, instead of fighting and dying over them now, Europeans argue about them in Brussels in a spirit of cooperation and mutual respect.
The whole world should take notice of this. If western Europe could come together after the carnage of World War II, if central Europe could do it following 50 years of communism, it can be done everywhere on this Earth.
Of course, for all of the positive developments and our good feelings today, the job of building a united Europe is certainly not finished, and it is important not to take all this self-congratulation too far. Instead, we should focus today on two big pieces of unfinished business and one enduring challenge.
The first piece of unfinished business is to make southeast Europe fully, finally, and forever a part of the rest of Europe. That is the only way to make peace last in that bitterly divided region.
It cannot be done by forcing people to live together; there is no bringing back the old Yugoslavia. It cannot be done by giving every community its own country, army, and flag. Shifting so many borders in the Balkans will only shake the peace further.
Our goal must be to debalkanize the Balkans. We must help them to create a magnet that will bring people together, a magnet more powerful than the polarizing pull of their old hatreds. That's what the Stability Pact that Germany helped to establish is designed to do, challenging the nations of southeast Europe to reform their economies and strengthen their democracies and pledging more than $6 billion from the rest of us to support their efforts. Now we must turn quickly those pledges into positive changes in the lives of ordinary people and steadily bring those nations into Western institutions.
We must also remain unrelenting in our support for a democratic transition in Serbia. For if there is to be a future for democracy and tolerance in this region, there must be no future for Mr. Milosevic and his policy of ethnic hatred and ethnic cleansing.
If southeastern Europe is to be fully integrated into the continent, Turkey also must be included. I applaud the EU's decision to treat Turkey as a real candidate for membership. I hope both Turkey and the EU will take the next steps. It will be good for Turkey, good for southeast Europe, good for more rapid reconciliation between Greece and Turkey and the resolution of Cyprus, and good for the entire world, which is still too divided over religious differences.
Our second piece of unfinished business concerns Russia. We must work to build a partnership with Russia that encourages stability, democracy, and cooperative engagement with the West and full integration with global institutions.
Only time will tell what Russia's ultimate role in Europe will be. We do not yet know if Russia's hard-won democratic freedoms will endure. We don't know yet whether it will define its greatness in yesterday's terms or tomorrow's. The Russian people will make those decisions.
Though Russia's transformation is incomplete, there clearly is reason for hope in Russia's remarkable journey over these last few years, from dictatorship to democracy, from communism to the market, from empire to nation-state, from adversary to partner in reducing the threat of weapons of mass destruction. Because the stakes are so high, we must do everything we can to encourage a Russia that is fully democratic and united in its diversity, a Russia that defines its greatness not by dominance of its neighbors but by the dominant achievements of its people and its partnership, a Russia that should be, indeed, must be, fully part of Europe.
That means no doors can be sealed shut to Russia, not NATO's, not the EU's. The alternative would be a future of harmful competition between Russia and the West and the end of our vision of an undivided continent.
As Winston Churchill said when he received the Charlemagne Prize in the far darker days of 1956, ""In a true unity of Europe, Russia must have her part."" Of course, Russia may very well decide it has no interest in formally joining European or transatlantic institutions. If that happens, we must make sure that, as the EU and NATO expand, their eastern borders become gateways to Russia, not barriers to trade, travel, and security cooperation. We must build real institutional links with Russia, as NATO has begun to do. Of course, it won't be easy, and there is still mistrust to be overcome on both sides, but it is possible and absolutely necessary.
The steps necessary to bring southeast Europe and Russia into the embrace of European unity illustrate the continued importance of the transatlantic alliance to both Europe and America. The enduring challenge we face, therefore, is to preserve and strengthen our alliance as Europe continues its coming together.
We have agreed on the principles. We have laid the foundations. But the future we're building will look very different from anything we have ever known. In a generation, I expect the EU will have as many as 30 members, from the Baltics to the Balkans to Turkey; a community of unprecedented cultural, political, and economic diversity and vitality. It will be a bigger Europe than Charlemagne ever dared dream, a reflection of our recognition that ultimately Europe is a unifying idea as much as a particular place, an expansive continent of different peoples who embrace a common destiny, play by the same rules, and affirm the same truths: that ethnic and religious hatred are unacceptable; that human rights are inalienable and universal; that our differences are a source of strength, not weakness; that conflicts must be resolved by arguments, not by arms.
I believe America must continue to support Europe's most ambitious unification efforts. And I believe Europe should want to strengthen our alliance even as you grow stronger. The alliance has been the bedrock of our security for half a century. It can be the foundation on which our common future is built.
Oh, it's easy to point to our differences. Many do. On my bad days, I do. But let's keep a healthy perspective. Consider these news headlines about U.S.-European dispute: ""Allies Complain of Washington's Heavy Hand,"" ""France to NATO: Non, Merci,"" ""U.S. Declares Economic Warfare on Allies,"" ""Protestors Rally Against American Arms Plan."" The first of those headlines is from the Suez crisis in 1956. The second is from 1966, when France left NATO's military command. The third is from 1981, the Siberian Pipeline crisis; the fourth, from 1986, during the debate about deploying intermediate nuclear missiles in Europe.
Yes, we've always had our differences, and being human and imperfect, we always will. But the simple fact is, since Europe is an idea as much as a place, America also is a part of Europe, bound by ties of family, history, and values.
More than ever, we are also actually connected. Underwater cables allow us to send staggering amounts of E-mail and E-commerce to each other instantaneously. A billion dollars in trade and investment goes back and forth every day, employing more than 14 million people on both sides of the Atlantic.
And there is the enduring connection, the 104,000 Americans who lie in military cemeteries across Europe. Today's Europe would not be possible without them. And whatever work I have done to merit your prize was built on their sacrifice.
So my friends, we must nourish the ties that bind us as we work to resolve honest disagreements and to overcome potentially harmful misperceptions on both sides of the Atlantic. Let me mention just two.
There is a perception right now in America that Europe doesn't always carry its fair share of our mutual responsibilities. Yet Europeans are providing more than 80 percent of both the troops keeping the peace in Kosovo and the funds for economic reconstruction there. And few Americans know that in our own backyard, Europeans paid for more than 60 percent of all aid to Central America when it was ravaged by Hurricane Mitch and a third of all support for peace in Guatemala.
At the same time, there is a perception in Europe that America's power—military, economic, cultural—is at times too overbearing. Perhaps our role in NATO's air campaign in Kosovo accentuated such fears. But in Kosovo, our power was exercised in alliance with Europe, in pursuit of our shared interest in European peace and stability, in defense of shared values central to the goal of European integration.
If, after Kosovo, European countries strengthen their own ability to act with greater authority and responsibility in times of crisis, while maintaining our transatlantic link, I think that is a very good thing. There is no contradiction between a strong Europe and a strong transatlantic partnership.
I would also like to mention that our partnership, as the lord mayor pointed out, and as Chancellor Schroeder said, remains profoundly important, not only to ourselves, but to the rest of the world as well. Together, we account for more than half the world's economy and 90 percent of its humanitarian aid. If we're going to win the fight against terrorism, organized crime, the spread of weapons of mass destruction; if we want to promote ethnic, religious, and racial tolerance; if we want to combat global warming and environmental degradation, fight infectious disease, ease poverty, and close the digital divide, clearly, we must do these things together.
Europe and America should draw strength from our transatlantic alliance. Europe should not be threatened by it, and America must not listen to those who say we should go it alone. America must remain Europe's good partner and good ally.
Lord Palmerston's rule that countries have no permanent alliances, only permanent interests, simply does not apply to our relationship. For America has a permanent interest in a permanent alliance with Europe. Our shared future is deeply rooted in our shared history. The American Revolution, after all, stemmed in part from the Seven Years War, which in turn stemmed from a treaty signed here in Aachen in 1748.
Now, a few days ago, I stood at the mouth of the Tagus River in Lisbon. From that spot over five centuries ago, brave Europeans began to explore the far reaches of our planet. They traveled unimaginable distances and conquered indescribable adversity on their way to find Asia, Africa, and the Americas. In their wake, the sons and daughters of this continent came across the Atlantic to populate places they called New Spain, New England, New France, New Netherlands, Nova Scotia, New Sweden, in short, a new Europe. Without the longing for a new Europe, there never would have been an America in the first place.
Now, as the longing for a new Europe takes root on the soil of the old continent, we should never let a sense of history's inevitability cloud our wonder at how astonishingly Europeans changed the rest of the world through enterprise, imagination, and their ability to grow, qualities that always will define Europe's identity far more accurately than any mapmaker ever will.
In the years ahead, as pilgrims of peace come here to Aachen, I hope they will reflect on the similarity of the two monuments enshrined here: first, the magnificent cathedral holding Charlemagne's mortal remains, begun in his lifetime, added to throughout the Middle Ages, repaired in the 20th century, when our failure to keep the peace required it; and second, the peace and unity that three generations have been building for five decades now in Europe, a work far from complete, perhaps never to be completed, but completely worthy of our best labors and dreams. Let us keep building this cathedral, the cathedral of European unity, on the foundation of our alliance for freedom. Because I have tried to lay a stone or two in my time, I am honored and humbled to accept this prize.
Thank you very much.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-receiving-the-international-charlemagne-prize-aachen-germany
Bill Clinton,"June 04, 2000",Interview With Aleksei Venediktov of Ekho Moskvy Radio in Moscow,"Mr. Venediktov. Good evening. Today we have a guest, the President of the United States of America. Good evening, Mr. President.
The President. Good evening.
Russia-U.S. Relations
Mr. Venediktov. Right off the bat, I'd like to say that today we've already had a press conference, which our listeners could see you, and so for that reason, my questions will not be political in nature. Mostly listeners will be asking their questions.
My first question is as follows, Mr. President. The latest public opinion poll in Russia by the Institute of—[inaudible]—had found that 11 percent of Russians see an enemy in the United States. Another 11 percent of Russians do not know how to answer this question. And 78 percent of Russians believe that Russia is more of a friend, rather than an enemy. I would ask you, since just the ordinary people say this, as to the other 22 percent who feel that Russia is either an enemy or do not know how to answer the question, what would you be able to say directly to those people who are now listening to you and watching you?
The President. Well, first I would say the 78 percent are right. And I would say that the United States has tried to be a friend to Russia and to democracy, prosperity, and strength in Russia.
I have worked hard to help support Russian democracy, Russian economic reform, and a large role for Russia in the world. I supported Russia coming into the G-8, to the Asian-Pacific economic leaders group; having a special partnership with NATO; working on the ground, our troops, Russian troops, side by side in the Balkans. And I intend to support Russia's effort to get a program going with the International Monetary Fund, with the World Bank. I believe the world needs a strong and prosperous and democratic Russia that respects the rule of law and the differences among its people. And that's what I've worked for.
So I have tried to be a good friend. And I think America wants friendly relations. The American people basically like the Russian people, and they feel better when they think we have good relations and that we have a good future together.
Mr. Venediktov. I believe, Mr. President, you are mistaken, because right in front of me is a Gallup poll from the United States, March of the year 2000, and the ""positive"" attitude towards Russia, or ""mostly positive,"" is only 40 percent of the American population; and ""mostly negative"" or ""very negative"" is 59 percent answers of the Americans who were polled. How could you explain to the Russians now why Americans, a significant part of the citizens, are negative towards United States? * Is it fear? Is it unhappiness? Are they angry, or what?
The President. I think it overwhelmingly is the opinion of the American people, and most people in the West, about the situation in Chechnya and the highly publicized other differences we have. But I think if you ask the American people another question, ""Would you like to see a good American relationship with a strong, prosperous, democratic Russia,"" they would say yes. And if you talk to the American people that have actually known Russians and you ask them, ""Do you like the Russian people,"" overwhelmingly they would say yes.
Joint Anti-Ballistic Missile System
Mr. Venediktov. I am finished with asking my questions, Mr. President. Now let's go to the questions that ordinary people have asked. Some questions came over the Internet—[inaudible]— from St. Petersburg—[inaudible]—from Moscow—and they basically all ask the same question. ""Why don't you want, together with Mr. Putin, together with Russia, to create a joint system of national anti-ballistic missile system? Why have not you accepted this proposal""— these questions came before the press conference, but it does increase the fear among those people, doesn't it?
The President. Well, let me explain the issue here. And I don't want to take too long on any questions, because we want to answer as many as possible, but this is very important.
First of all, I have no objection to working with Russia on a joint missile defense that would intercept a missile directed at Russia or the United States from a hostile power in the Middle East or anywhere else, in the so-called boost phase. I have no objection to doing that. I think we should work together on it. The problem is, we think it will take 10 years or more to develop; the technology is not yet available.
Now, by contrast, we expect to face this threat in the United States within 5 years, and we think the other technology for the limited national missile defense will be available within that time. So that's why I haven't agreed to scrap what seems to be a clear way of defending our country for an unclear way. But I think it's important that the Russian people and the American people understand the exact nature of the dispute here.
Mr. Venediktov. But it frightens Russians, obviously.
The President. Yes, I understand. But I think they won't be frightened if they understand the exact nature of the difference, even if we can't resolve the difference.
The Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty of 1972 enshrined a theory of our security—that is, Russian security and American security—based on strategic stability and mutual deterrence. That is, we would never have so many defensive weapons, and we wouldn't have national missile defenses that could interfere with our offensive weapons, so that neither of us would ever launch nuclear missiles at each other because of that. Okay.
Now, we recognized that things might change and threats might come from other places, even way back then. So there was a possibility of amending the missile defense treaty. Now, we recognize—just today President Putin and I signed a statement of principles that said, ""Okay, there is a new threat; the treaty may be able to be amended, but we disagree right now on how to meet the threat."" That's what we said.
The narrow issue is this: If the U.S. has a missile defense that can stop a couple of missiles from North Korea, does it have the potential to upset what has kept us safe all these years, which is mutual deterrence and stability? We say, no; they say, the Russians say, it might. So we're trying to work through that.
But the point is, neither side believes the other side is trying to hurt them directly. There is an honest difference of opinion here. And we closed some of the gaps in our two positions, and we promise to keep working on it.
Believe me, I did not want to scrap the ABM Treaty or the theory of mutual deterrence or strategic stability. Both President Putin and I want to reduce the number of offensive missiles but keep the theory that has kept us safe all these years.
Mr. Venediktov. I think it's time to listen to some phone calls. I would like to say to Mr. President that now the Ekho program also is carrying out electronic voting, and at the end of our discussion, we'd like to comment you on what we get. The question that people are voting on is as follows: Will the situation under President Putin improve towards the United States, or will it get worse, or you don't know? So by the end of the program here we'll get some results.
U.S. Economic Issues
Hello, this is the first call. Please, what is your question to President Clinton? ""Do you think financial crisis is possible in the United States? Thank you. I guess the Russian crisis does not bother you, is not a concern to you. What about America? Is there an economic crisis possible in the United States?""
The President. Well, first of all, the Russian condition does concern me. I think when the Russian economy is healthier, the American economy will be healthier. And I intend to support the economic reform program that the President and the Prime Minister have outlined.
I think a financial crisis is unlikely in the United States, as long as we have a good economic program, as long as we keep our budget in surplus, as long as we're continuing to open our markets and compete with other countries, and as long as we're investing in our people. If we have good policies and we work hard, I think a big financial crisis is unlikely.
Political Satire
Mr. Venediktov. The next phone call. ""Have you ever seen the puppets program? Have you seen your own puppet? And how do you relate to the fact that there is a program such as this that lampoons Presidents?""
The President. I haven't seen it. Perhaps I can get it on tape and watch it; I would like to see it. But it doesn't bother me. I have been lampooned in America a lot. There is almost nothing anybody can say to make fun of me that hasn't been said already. And as long as it's said in good spirit and good humor, I don't mind. I think we need people to make fun of us so we don't take ourselves too seriously. And if it's not said in good spirits, then you just have to ignore it and go to work every day.
Freedom of the Press
Mr. Venediktov. Okay, in that case, I have a question, Mr. President. It seems to me, despite the first amendment of the Constitution, any President of the United States, or Argentina or Russia, any other country, has a desire to kind of squash the press, which is not—that follows you all the time, looks for dirty stories, is always trying to hound you. Have you ever had a desire to shake a journalist real strong? And if you've had such feelings, how did you manage to control them? This is the main question. Of course, it refers to just about any— it could be asked for any President, any leader.
The President. Well, of course, from time to time you read something that you believe is either untrue or unfair, or maybe you're afraid it is true, and you just wish it weren't printed. And you can get angry. But I think the important thing—in our country, for example, if you're a public figure, it's almost impossible to even win a lawsuit against somebody who's deliberately lying about you, because we have bent over backwards in favor of the freedom of the press.
Now, why do we do that? Because we think that democracy is more stable and people are more free when the press is free. And we trust the people to understand if the press is either false or unfair. In other words—particularly in this electronic age, when someone says something about me that's not true, I can go on a program like this, and I can say, here's what they say; here's the truth. I can go on television. I can give a speech.
So what we believe is that even though if you have a really free press, that much freedom can carry with it irresponsibility, you still have more stability in society by letting people be free, by letting the debates unfold, and by trusting that the citizens, the voters, in the end, will get it right.
And we've had this first amendment for over 200 years now. And the press has become more and more and more free. The meaning of it has been broadened. And our country has gotten stronger and stronger. It can become personally painful if someone says something that maybe they shouldn't say, but the society is stronger with a free press. And if you trust the people, then you must believe that if something is said you don't agree with, you go out and disagree. You tell the people your side, and you trust them to make the right decision. That's what I believe gives you the strongest society.
Mr. Venediktov. Have you spoken to President Putin about freedom of the press in Russia?
The President. Yes, we had a discussion about it, and I said in my press conference today— I quoted his statement. President Putin said that without civil society and free press, the Russian democracy couldn't go on. And I think that's a wise statement.
I also believe, though, that this is something that has to be debated and fought for and struggled for. For example, in the beginning of our democracy, around 1800, we had the same Constitution we have today. But there were—people could bring lawsuits against people who printed things in the newspapers, and often win in ways that intimidated them. So we had to keep changing the law to try to preserve the right for totally innocent private citizens to bring suit against people who might use the press to hurt them deliberately and to lie about them deliberately, while still allowing a very broad range for political debate and dispute and dissent.
So we've been working on this a long time. But the trend has always been for more freedom of the press, particularly where public issues and public officials are concerned. And I think it's fair to say that no one in modern history in our country has had either more negative press or more painful press than I have, but I still think on balance as long as you get to answer, the people have a chance to get it right, and you get more stability, because an open press also ensures that all these issues are fully debated and that all sides are fully heard.
So I believe it's an instrument of stability. And if you think it's not free enough here, then what I would urge you to do is to look at the example of America. Read the 200-year history of our country and just work on the issues as they come up. Just keep pushing for more— a broader and broader and broader interpretation of freedom of the press. But as I said, we've been working on it a long time. But it's served us well.
Mr. Venediktov. But you don't necessarily have to expel journalists. To tell you the truth, I have read the memoirs of your former Press Secretary, Mr. Stephanopoulos. You get upset, not do nothing, answer, or just let it go past you. Or you could ask the tax police, for example, to check on the business of CNN, or you could——
The President. Yes, but I never did that. I would never do that. And, first of all, it's now clearly illegal for a President to do that. It's not lawful. If you're mad at somebody, I think the thing to do is to express your anger, blow off steam, and go on about your business. Or even better, control your anger and think of a way to make sure the public has the impression you believe is the right one.
[At this point, the program paused for station identification.]
International Monetary Fund
Mr. Venediktov. You're live on the air; hello? What is your question? ""I'd like to ask what kind of influence does the President have on the International Monetary Fund, and why is it not giving us credits? It seems that we have an economic uprise in our economy, and we're not getting any credits from the International Monetary Fund. I'd like to get an answer to this question. Why?""
The President. Well, first of all, the President can have some influence over the International Monetary Fund, but he doesn't run it. All the various contributors to the Fund have some influence. I have focused a lot on trying to reform the IMF, to make sure that its policies and practices meet the real needs of countries for the 21st century.
Secondly, I do support Russia getting a program with the IMF and getting financial help from the IMF. Your new President, Mr. Putin, and your new Prime Minister have come up with a very good plan, and when they go before the IMF and ask for financial support, the United States will support them. They're putting the plan together now; they're going to make the presentation. I expect to support it.
Next Administration
Mr. Venediktov. Mr. President, I'd like to check to see how ready you are to quick questions, quick answers, we got over the Internet from Russia, all of Russia. These are private questions. You're a sports person, you know sports—are you ready to answer them?
The President. I'll do my best.
Mr. Venediktov. Mr. President, what kind of slogan would you put on the wall of the Oval Room for the next President?
The President. What should the next President's slogan be? Making the most of our prosperity, meeting the big challenges of the 21st century.
President's Spending Money
Mr. Venediktov. How long has it been since you've held money in your hands, cash?
The President. About an hour.
Mr. Venediktov. What did you buy?
The President. Oh, I didn't buy anything, but I got my—I'm going to dinner after I leave you, and so I brought my money with me. But I try to go out and shop every—buy something every few months, anyway, just so I keep in touch with people. And I talk to people in bookstores, or I go buy something for my wife or my daughter, just to see what things cost and see what people are doing. I think it's important that Presidents not get too isolated.
Mr. Venediktov. A favorite question that we always ask on our radio station programs, Mr. President, do you remember how you made your first dollar, earned your first dollar, and how did you spend it?
The President. Well, I remember how I made it; I don't remember how I spent it. The first thing I did to earn money was cutting lawns and cutting hedges and taking care of the yards of the people who lived in my neighborhood. And I was probably about 9 or 10 years old when I did that.
In my lifetime, I probably had earned money doing 20 or 25 different things. I've built houses. I've cleared land. I've worked in a grocery store. I had a news comic book business. Obviously, I was a musician. I made money as a musician. I've been a teacher. I've done a lot of different things in my life.
Personal Transportation
Mr. Venediktov. This is a question from the city of—[inaudible]. ""Mr. President, do you know how to drive a car, an airplane, a submarine, tank?"" Maybe President Putin has inspired this question.
The President. Yes, to the car, although I haven't driven one in a while. And, no, to the airplane. I have taken off and landed a small plane—25 years ago my wife gave me airplane lessons—but I never pursued it. I never got my pilot's license. And I have never—the submarine—I've ridden in a tank, but I've never driven a tank or guided a submarine.
President's Family
Mr. Venediktov. Going back to the telephone questions, here's another question from the Internet. ""What do you value in this life most of all?""
The President. My family, in this life.
Post-Cold-War Russia
Mr. Venediktov. There will be other questions about your wife and your daughter. And now back to the telephones. Your question, please? Hello? You're live on the air. The question is as follows: In 1995 Mr. President spoke at a meeting of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. And he very highly praised the role of the United States in the ideological efforts to make the Soviet Union fall apart. And the question was said about disassembling Russia, the falling apart of the military complex, and creating regimes in these republics, which we need, as he said. And so the question: How can you comment on that statement that you made at that time?
The President. Well, first of all, I wish I had exactly the words before me. But if I said that I thought the United States and its allies in the cold war, by staying strong, hastened the end of communism and the end of the Soviet Union and the liberation of all these various states and the rise of democracy—I believed that then; I still believe that.
But that does not mean that I think Russia should be weak. I want Russia to be strong. I have worked for 8 years for a strong Russia. I want Russia to be strong and prosperous. But I also want it to be democratic, to respect the differences of its people—religious, ethnic, and otherwise—and to be governed by the rule of law.
But I do not want a weak Russia. I want Russia to be strong. And I also want Russia, as I said just a couple of days ago in Germany, to have the ability to be fully part of all major international institutions and have its full say there.
Russia's World Status
Mr. Venediktov. And in this connection, there is a question. ""Mr. President, could you frankly say for the United States today, is Russia a country of the Third World, a developing nation?""
The President. No. No. Russia was badly hurt by the recent economic crisis and by some problems in the transition from a command-and-control Communist economy to a market economy. You know the problems as well as I do. But it is a country with a vast and impressive array of science and technology achievements, incredibly well-educated people, and the capacity, I believe, to see a big growth in per capita income very quickly.
So it's not fair to say that Russia is a developing or Third World country. It is fair to say, I think, that the incomes of the Russian people are far below where they should be and far below where they will be if the new government implements serious economic reforms and investors from around the world have confidence that their money will be treated in an appropriate way. I think you will see a large growth in jobs and incomes here, because your people are immensely talented. I think you've got good years ahead of you.
Mr. Venediktov. Since we don't have much time left, I would like to once again ask a quickstyle question and expect that you could answer quickly. These, like I said, are private questions, private nature, from our listeners. Here's a question from one of our listeners—[inaudible]— who does the Soviet program, they're continuing a live broadcast of this show—maybe you remember, he set up an interview with you——
The President. Yes, he did.
First Lady's Political Future
Mr. Venediktov. ""Some say the political career of Hillary Clinton will be so successful that she will become the President of the United States of America. Who knows? Are you ready to return to the White House as a husband of the President, being sort of the First Mister? How do you look at it?"" [Laughter]
The President. Well, let me say, first of all, I'm very proud of my wife for running for the Senate. She's running hard, and I think she'll win. And she's promised to serve her full term. Now, when she finishes that service, if she wants to continue in public life, I'll support her any way I can.
But I expect that the Vice President, Al Gore, will be elected President. And I expect he'll run for reelection. And after that, who knows what will happen? But I'll say that I'm very proud of my wife, and I'm going to support her political career any way I can. And I'm going to try to be a good citizen in any way that I can, both of my country and of the world, when I leave office.
Chelsea Clinton
Mr. Venediktov. Mr. President, are you happy with your daughter, how she's studying, how she relates to her relatives, to her parents?
The President. Well, I think when you become the parent of a young man or a young woman, you're always happy when they still want to be around you and spend some time with you. So I'm very happy with her. I'm very proud of her, and I love her very much.
Mr. Venediktov. A Moscow student asks you to convey his greetings to her, and says that the growing generation will correct your mistakes—he and she will improve the mistakes of their parents.
The President. I certainly hope so. I certainly hope so. That's what's supposed to happen in life.
President's View of Russia
Mr. Venediktov. And the last question—I'm asking this one. It's a poll, and I would like for you to comment on the results. Just before your visit, there were questions raised about you—not just about America but you, yourself. What do you think about Russia? That was a question to the Russians. I think the public have come up with very interesting results. One-third, exactly, feels that you, personally—you, not America but you, personally—feel that you're a positively disposed towards America. Onethird, exactly, thinks that you are ill-disposed. And one-third thinks that they cannot answer this question. I would like Mr. President, by the end of our discussion agree to say something to the people who have doubts in you.
The President. Well, I think that I made it clear that I'm positively disposed toward Russia, but I understand why a third would question that. That is—why would you question that? Well, because we had differences between the United States and Russia over Bosnia, Kosovo, Chechnya.
Mr. Venediktov. By the way, there were many questions on Kosovo.
The President. Yes, yes.
Mr. Venediktov. Do you agree with the fact that there was a mistake made?
The President. So we had differences. But I would like to ask you to consider on the other side—I led the way in supporting Russia's entry into the G-8 organization, the prestigious international organization, into the Asian-Pacific leaders organization, into the special partnership agreement with NATO. I have supported every effort to help Russia economically. I have been here five times. No American President has ever been here five times to Moscow. I wouldn't be surprised if no American President ever comes here five times again.
I first came to this city in 1969 when I was 23 years old. And I have been favorably disposed toward Russia and the Russian people ever since—notwithstanding our disagreements, even during the cold war.
And one of the things that I have always tried to do is to help support a free, prosperous, strong Russia that is fully integrated into the international institutions and the Western institutions, so that tomorrow and in all of the tomorrows to come, you will be a great nation. But greatness will be defined not by the dominance of your neighbors but by the dominance of the achievement of your people and the power of your partnerships with other countries. That's what I want, and I've worked very hard for it.
But I am extremely favorably disposed toward the people of Russia. And I am extremely optimistic about the future partnerships between the United States and Russia.
Mr. Venediktov. I thank you, Mr. President, for coming here. Of course, many questions have been left unasked. And I hope that after you return, after your term of office has ended, return back to Russia—perhaps even before that—you will be able to come back to the studio again, because I have many other questions. If you would allow, I would give all these questions to your staff and maybe some of them would interest you.
The President. Yes, do.
President Vladimir Putin of Russia
Mr. Venediktov. The last one. There were 5,000 of them that came in. You see the results. Forty-eight percent of the viewers—[inaudible]—believe that the relations between the United States and Russia will improve under Putin. Forty-two percent believe that they will get worse. And the rest don't know. What do you think about this last poll that we just made?
The President. Well, I think that it reflects, first of all, the fact that he's just in office, so people can't know for sure. Secondly, you've got almost 49 percent saying they will, which shows that people appreciate the fact that he's a strong and able man who has been gracious to me in this first meeting of ours in Russia. And then the 42 percent, I think, are focused on the differences we've had and the problems that have been publicized.
The truth is, you can't know for sure. But I think that based on the meeting I had, we've got a better than even chance that our relationship will improve. The relationship between the United States and Russia is profoundly important. It will tend always to be characterized by the disagreements, because they will always get more press coverage, because they will always be more current. But if there is a strong underlying commitment to democracy, to freedom, to mutual prosperity, mutual respect, I think that over time they will get better even if there are disagreements. That's what I believe, and that's what I've worked for.
Future Visit to Ekho Moskvy
Mr. Venediktov. Thank you very much, Mr. President. We will be waiting for your return, so that you could answer——
The President. I'd like to come back.
Mr. Venediktov. ——by being in the studio some of the other questions, maybe as a businessman or a lawyer. Thank you very much.
The President. I'd love to come back, because I saw on your wall that the only way I get to sign my picture is if I come twice, you see. So I'd like to come back. And I want to thank all the people who called or who E-mailed in their questions. And I hope you will give me all the questions, and maybe I can write you something about them, too.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-aleksei-venediktov-ekho-moskvy-radio-moscow
Bill Clinton,"June 04, 2000",Press Briefing by Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott,"National Hotel
Moscow, Russia
8:10 P.M. (L)
MR. HAMMER: Good evening, everyone. Tonight, we have Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott who will be briefing you on the results of the just-concluded summit between President Clinton and President Putin. Mr. Talbott has an engagement later on, so this won't go on terribly long, but here is Mr. Talbott.
DEPUTY SECRETARY TALBOTT: Thank you, Mike. Good evening to all of you. I think it was clear from the presidential press conference that you all just attended, or at least watched on television, that President Clinton and President Putin covered a great deal of ground over the last couple of days.
You heard a number of the issues referred to during the course of the press conference -- global issues, regional issues, bilateral issues, economic, strategic, diplomatic. They did, however, particularly during the working private dinner that they had in the Kremlin last night, spend a good deal of time talking about the future of the strategic relationship and how we can move forward to address new threats to the security of the international community and to the security of the United States and Russia in particular, and also how we can continue to make dramatic progress over time in reducing the nuclear legacy of the Cold War.
Now, during the course of the event that you just saw, the two Presidents signed a joint statement on principles of strategic stability. And what I would like to do in the short time that we have here is add a bit to what President Clinton had to say on that subject.
I think in a very real sense, the principles document, as we've come to call it, is a classic example of something that we have tried to do and very often succeeded in doing overt seven-plus years of this administration in dealing with the Russian Federation, and that is to maximize our areas of agreement, but also to manage those differences that remain between us. And there is both agreement and disagreement manifest in this document.
We are not claiming, nor are the Russians claiming that this joint statement puts to rest the cluster of issues surrounding the national missile defense system, the ABM Treaty, or the future of the START agreement. And all of those, I think properly, have been the focus of a lot of attention. That said, we do see this joint statement as a useful interim step that provides, we think, an important framework for pushing ahead on the issues that are subsumed by the principles document -- namely, strategic offense, strategic defense, and strategic arms control.
We think the principles document constitutes a set of guidelines for the future of our strategic relationship in general with the Russian Federation, and for further work on the ABM Treaty and START III, in particular.
Now, what I would like to do is parse the document a little bit with you. I trust you all have copies of it now. It's not absolutely essential -- well, okay, by all means go get copies. I'm going to refer to several of the paragraphs when I underscore or highlight what I think are the four key points that are contained in the joint statement.
The first point is that it affirms that both countries are committed to maintaining and strengthening strategic stability. That's paragraph two. Now, what this means in very simple terms is that neither side will seek unilateral advantage against the other, or seek to take actions that would deprive the other of a credible retaliatory deterrent.
Both President Clinton and President Putin believe that in managing strategic relations between the world's two largest nuclear powers, stability and mutual deterrence still matter. Now, mutual deterrence as codified in the ABM Treaty of 1972 has been a cornerstone of stability for the past 28 years. And we expect that it will remain so in the future as both sides continue to reduce strategic offensive arms.
That leads me to the second point that I want to underscore, and this is contained particularly in paragraph six. The joint statement acknowledges that the world has changed since 1972, when the ABM Treaty was signed. Now, in many ways, the world has changed for the better -- most notably with the end of the Cold War and the reduction of U.S. and first Soviet, then Russian, deployed strategic offensive forces by roughly 40 percent.
But while the threat of global thermonuclear war has dramatically receded, other threats have arisen. And one of the most serious of those new threats is the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile technology. That is the means to deliver nuclear and other mass destruction weapons.
And as you'll see in paragraph six, the joint statement acknowledges that that threat, that new threat, which has come sharply into focus and into being since 1972 and in recent years, represents a potentially significant change in the strategic situation and in the international security environment.
The joint statement also acknowledges that the ABM Treaty itself, by its own terms, as President Clinton put it during the press conference, in the minds and in the language used by the framers of the ABM Treaty, permits the parties to consider possible changes in the strategic situation and, in the light of those changes, to consider proposals for further increasing the viability of the treaty -- that is, steps that would make the treaty more relevant to the current and prospective security environment. And there, I would call your attention to paragraph number 8.
And it's in that spirit that the Presidents directed their governments to develop concrete measures that would allow both sides to take necessary steps to preserve strategic stability in the face of new threats. That's paragraph 14. They've asked Secretary Albright and Foreign Minister Ivanov to report to the Presidents on efforts to develop these measures.
Third point: Consistent with the joint statement and consistent, I think, very much with the exchange that you heard between the two Presidents this afternoon, they've also instructed their experts to develop a series of cooperative measures whereby the United States and Russia can jointly address the problem of ballistic missile proliferation.
I'll give you a few examples of the kind of cooperative measures we have in mind. One is implementation of the shared early warning agreement, which was designed today also by the Presidents and on which you've been briefed earlier. Second is more extensive bilateral and multilateral cooperation on theater missile defense.
Now, both sides have ideas and have put forward ideas in this area, and were already cooperating in some ways such as joint TMD exercises. Third area of cooperation -- joint work in an open, multinational arrangement that would ultimately be open to all to combat missile proliferation. And here, what we are thinking about and talking to the Russians about would be to synthesize -- that is to take the best of ideas that are out there from both sides with regard to strengthening the missile technology control regime, and also in developing the Russian idea of a global control system. The purpose of this effort would be to construct a multifaceted, multilateral approach to preventing the proliferation of ballistic missile technology.
And the fourth and last example I would give are initiatives to further develop U.S. and Russian cooperation in the field of nuclear weapons safety and security.
Now, let me if I could pause for one moment on this question of cooperation. The two sides have ongoing programs in some of these areas, and we've been discussing new ideas for cooperation over time in the future. Our experts will meet in the coming weeks to develop a comprehensive plan, drawing on the ideas of both sides, for the Presidents to review when they next meet on the margins of the G-8 summit in Okinawa.
Now, I think it's already clear that what we're talking about here is a multidimensional threat that requires a multidimensional response, and that requires cooperation in many different areas. And there is one area of cooperation where we clearly have more work to do, where our work is not done as a result of this summit. And that is diplomatic cooperation on the ABM Treaty itself.
Our view -- the United States' view -- is that the United States and Russia are going to need to work cooperatively to adapt the ABM Treaty to meet the emerging ballistic missile threat. How exactly we're going to do that is still at issue.
That brings me to the fourth and final point that I want to underscore in the joint statement, and it's in paragraph 15, which is that the joint statement reaffirms that there is a very close logical connection or linkage between strategic offense and strategic defense -- and, therefore, between strategic offensive arms control, START, and strategic defensive arms control of the kind that we've carried out under the aegis of the ABM Treaty.
The joint statement commits the two sides to intensive talks on further reductions in strategic forces in parallel with further discussions on ABM-related issues. Now, this is not a new point of agreement between us. The same linkage was very much a part of the discussions in the agreement between President Clinton and President Yeltsin during the Cologne summit last year.
Experts are going to meet over the summer with the objective of working out what we're calling the basic elements of a START III treaty. But they're also going to continue high-level exchanges on the ABM Treaty and how we believe it should be changed to accommodate the new environment.
Now, that's what's been agreed, and I think it's a lot. It represents important progress toward developing a joint approach for dealing with new challenges to our security. But I want to reiterate and be very clear about those issues that are still open.
The Russian side is more than capable of speaking for itself here. But I think that the clarity and realism with which each of us understands the other's position is an important part of what's been accomplished here -- first and foremost, between the two Presidents during their very intensive discussion of this issue over dinner last night.
President Putin made absolutely clear to President Clinton that Russia continues to oppose the changes to the ABM Treaty that the United States has proposed since last September -- that is, the changes necessary to permit deployment of phase one of our limited national missile defense plan. Russia believes that NMD will undermine strategic stability, threaten Russia's strategic deterrent, and provoke a new arms race.
So I want to be quite explicit on this point. The joint statement does not reflect or imply Russian agreement to change the ABM Treaty along the lines of our proposal, or, for that matter, along the lines of any other proposal. But as I said earlier, while it's true that Russia has not accepted our proposals, they have, through the adoption of these principles, agreed to a framework that includes discussion of possible changes to the ABM Treaty to meet new threats to our security.
Now, I talked about how clear President Putin was. President Clinton was just as clear in stating his belief that the ABM Treaty can and should be adapted to allow for a limited national missile defense without damaging strategic stability or undercutting mutual deterrence between the United States and Russia.
As I think he made quite clear in the press conference, with regard to NMD, President Clinton told President Putin that he will make a decision later this year on whether to move forward with that program, and he will make that decision on the basis of the four criteria that he laid out last year, which were technology, threat, cost, and impact on overall national security, including impact on arms control.
Nothing in the joint statement, indeed nothing that has transpired at this summit, prejudices President Clinton's decision or limits his options, or, for that matter, the next President's options with respect to national missile defense.
I'd be happy to go to your questions.
Q: Strobe, if I can try and break apart the two parts of the argument the Russians aren't buying -- the Russians agree that there is a threat emerging there, but I assume it's safe to believe there was not agreement on the nature of that threat.
DEPUTY SECRETARY TALBOTT: That is correct. You're in a very good place to get authoritative elaboration of the Russian position. But that is certainly part of what we've been hearing from them. They feel that the threat is exaggerated, but at the very core of their objection today to the proposed NMD is concern about what they see as a threat to the Russian strategic deterrent.
I have colleagues here in this room -- Under Secretary of Defense Slocombe, Assistant Secretary of Defense Warner, and others -- who have been engaged over a period of many, many months in extraordinarily detailed, non-polemic, highly technical discussions with the Russians here in Moscow, in the ""tank"" in the Pentagon, and elsewhere on this issue. Clearly, we haven't eliminated the difference between us, but we have had -- we certainly understand the technical arguments, and I think that we have made some progress at the level of facts, physics, and geography.
Q: If I could just follow, the second side of it is, what part of the President's assurances that this does not constitute -- that this does not undermine the Russian deterrent -- what part of that did the Russians not accept'
DEPUTY SECRETARY TALBOTT: Well, I don't want to -- I've gone a long way toward parsing both what has been agreed and being frank with you about where we still have additional work to do. Having participated in these discussions over the last nine months, I think that the objective case that the United States has made is very compelling, but for it to become the basis of an agreement with the Russians, they need to see that, too.
I think it's worth keeping in mind that while President Putin clearly has followed this issue very closely, and he's had his head of the Security Council, his Foreign Minister, and a number of his top advisors engaged directly with us, this was really the first serious and sustained opportunity for him as President to hear directly from President Clinton.
Q: Did the Russians reiterate today or last night what they have said up until just a few weeks ago, particularly Mr. Ivanov in Washington -- there's a way to deal with this threat, however we may disagree on the dimensions of it? With theater missile defenses, with the 1997 agreement, which had you and other people in the administration quite ecstatic as having accomplished quite a bit in getting the Russians to buy into the U.S. interpretation of four different types of tests which could be conducted within the limits of the ABM Treaty, do they still say that's the way to go? Or do they now say, we don't know how to go about this?
DEPUTY SECRETARY TALBOTT: Barry, you've never seen me ecstatic.
Q: You were pretty ecstatic. The senior official was.
DEPUTY SECRETARY TALBOTT: Theater missile defense, theater-based antimissile systems, are very much on the table as something that we ought to be discussing with the Russians, and we have been discussing with the Russians, and indeed, it's something that we've been discussing with our allies. Because, again, this is not a simple problem. There is not just one imaginable manifestation of this new threat.
And we are prepared to pursue with the Russians cooperation in the area of TMD, as long as they understand, which I'm sure they do, that it would be a supplement, and maybe you could even say a complement to what -- to other things that we very well may have to do. But it's not a substitute for NMD, in other words.
Q: So they now see it as simply a supplement and not a remedy?
DEPUTY SECRETARY TALBOTT: They understand that we see it as a supplement --
Q: How do they see it? What do they say about how they see it? Did they reiterate their position of just a few weeks ago, or has there been, quote, ""new flexibility"" on it?
DEPUTY SECRETARY TALBOTT: I wouldn't want to characterize the Russian position in that fashion, not least of all because by far, the most substantive discussions on this subject took place between the two Presidents and it's going to continue between the two Presidents, but it's also going to take place between ministers. Secretary Cohen, for example, will be coming to Moscow before too long. Secretary Albright and Secretary Ivanov are going to keep working on this. John Holum is going to be meeting with his Russian counterpart, Ambassador Kapralov.
Obviously, we wouldn't have put as much effort into trying to summarize and crystallize our points of agreement if we didn't feel that those points of agreement provided the basis for moving forward in the future. In other words, what you see here today, I think, is neither what many were predicting or were concerned about, which is a dead end, nor is it a destination. But it's a clarification of the path forward. And I think you heard from the two Presidents, from their level, a sort of management impulse to both governments to keep working on this issue, not be driven by artificial deadlines. And we've got both time and a clearer sense of the framework within which we should work.
Q: Could you square what you said about the Russians thinking that they feel the threat is exaggerated with point six of the joint statement, where it says that they agree the international community faces a dangerous and growing threat? What is the Russian perception of the new and emerging threat? And is it country-specific?
DEPUTY SECRETARY TALBOTT: Elaine, I really think that the only honest and appropriate answer is to refer you to them for their best effort to answer that question. We happen to think that the threat posed most particularly by the North Korean ballistic missile program, the so-called Tae-po dong program, is an objective reality. The world that we're describing here, the world that is covered by the ABM Treaty, changed very vividly on August 31, 1998, when the North Koreans fired that missile, and the question is, can the ABM Treaty, can the U.S.-Russian strategic relationship, including in its cooperative dimension, change to take account of those new realities. And as for the Russian answer to that and the Russian view on that, I'd refer you to them.
Q: Did the two Presidents speak about specific threats -- North Korea, Iraq, Iran?
DEPUTY SECRETARY TALBOTT: Yes. And they could do so fairly economically, because their ministers and experts had spent a great deal of time on this and there was a good deal of background -- they were sort of off to a running start on this subject last night, because they both have worked on it.
And the essence of what President Clinton said was the following: He believes very much in the ABM Treaty. I think that was clear again in what he said again today. And it certainly is not his preferred option to do anything that would harm the ABM Treaty or that would require the United States to withdraw from it. At the same time, he made very clear that his options on what he may decide as President he has to do to protect the United States remain wide open.
The ABM Treaty, in its essence, protects the principle of mutual deterrence between the United States and Russia. It protects the principle that Russia has a right to a credible, retaliatory capability. But the ABM Treaty does not protect the right of North Korea or any other third country to threaten the United States with ballistic missiles.
Q: The President suggested in the press conference that we might be prepared to go below START III framework numbers on offensive warheads if we had some assurance that this new threat would be taken care of -- is that an approach that we think the Russians may find interesting and may buy into?
DEPUTY SECRETARY TALBOTT: The President has said consistently that the United States is prepared to discuss a future strategic arms control beyond START III. But we're not at START III yet. We're not at START II yet. We haven't implemented START II. Despite that, we have begun discussions with the Russians on target numbers, which is to say a range of strategic offensive levels for START III.
Three years ago, in this meeting that Barry was referring to, that represented the culmination of intense deliberation within the United States government and intense negotiation between the United States and Russia that had a result. And the result was that the target for START III should be 2,000, 2,500. So let's take this thing a step at a time.
Q: Has the disagreement over the ABM Treaty now essentially frozen progress on START III?
DEPUTY SECRETARY TALBOTT: No. In fact, I think that what you see in this document should provide an impulse to forward movement -- whatever the opposite of freezing is. I don't think it was frozen, by the way, up until now, because it basically establishes clear agreement between us that these two processes are going to have to move forward together -- the control of strategic defenses and the reduction of strategic offenses. And it's in that spirit that we're going to be getting together with them very soon.
Q: There was no movement on START III at these meetings today?
DEPUTY SECRETARY TALBOTT: Well, there is not going to be definitive and decisive movement on START III until the overall strategic context of our strategic offensive arsenals and the Russians is clear. That context now includes new threats of the kind that we've talked about here. And the Russians acknowledge that as a principle, and the question is now translating that principle into practical steps.
Q: Can you -- given the derisive reception of the Clinton-Gore administration to Governor Bush's discussion of NMD, ABM, and the whole sort of area of Russian relations, how did you take the unsolicited sort of words of President Putin that he can do business with either of the candidates?
DEPUTY SECRETARY TALBOTT: Well, first of all, I'm not going to accept the premise of your question. I'm not going to characterize either the Republican position on this issue or the Clinton administration's characterization of the Republican position on this issue. I can tell you that what President Putin had to say on the subject struck me as basic good sense, which is that the Russian Federation and its President will deal with whomever the American people decide is to be their President.
Q: Strobe, did the Russians say this weekend that they feel that if the President does go ahead with approval of phase one, that he will be in violation of the ABM Treaty? And what did they say when you point out that what you're talking about would knock down only a fraction of the Soviet strategic arsenal, that it would be no threat to their arsenal? Do they say, nyet, that this is the start of a slippery slope?
DEPUTY SECRETARY TALBOTT: Their concern about NMD is in part captured by the last thing that you said. That is, they're concerned that phase one will not only lead to phase two, but will lead on and on and on.
Our position has been that the NMD program in its two phases is very carefully designed to do two things -- one, to deal with a certain kind of threat, namely, relatively small numbers of third country ICBMs; but, two, to leave intact mutual deterrence and the Russian retaliatory capability. It's also our view that we've come a long way, we've come 28 years with a lot of changes in the world -- notably, including in this country, and in the essence of the nature between this country and our country -- and we've done so with an ABM Treaty that's now 28 years old. It was modified two years after it was signed, and it's now time to take a good, hard look about ways to save it, to make sure that it lasts for another 28 years. That's what this is about.
I think that without in any way prejudging where the Russian Federation will come out on this issue, they understand our position even more clearly now than they did before -- not least because their President has heard it directly from out President.
Q: A couple of days before this weekend's talks, President Putin gave an interview with NBC, and after that interview there was a lot of reporting that Putin plans to propose some sort of joint missile defense involving both countries sharing technology. Did Putin raise anything of the kind?
DEPUTY SECRETARY TALBOTT: Well, there has been discussion between us and the Russians -- Walt Slocombe and Ted Warner have had a lot more detailed conversation along these lines than I have because there's been a lot of good military-to-military contact, as well -- about the possibility of cooperating on various kinds of missile defense. We haven't ruled any of that out. We see some of it as being potentially responsive and relevant to some of the problems that we might face in the future, problems that we would like to face jointly with Russia.
But there is, kind of right in the middle of the road, one very big problem. And it's the prospect within the next five years or so of a North Korean ICBM. And theater missile defense, for a variety of technical reasons, cannot deal with an ICBM -- or at least we're not sure, we don't have any reason for confidence that we could develop a system of, say -- just for example, since it's been in the news -- theater-based boost-phase intercept, in anything like the time frame in which this threat is maturing.
MR. HAMMER: Last question.
Q: How much time was spent discussing Chechnya? And was there any kind of meeting of the minds, any kind of progress there?
DEPUTY SECRETARY TALBOTT: I would say quite a bit of time was spent on Chechnya. And there's something, to be honest, a little bit lopsided about this conversation. I realize I'm responsible for that, because we've properly spent a lot of time discussing one great big issue. But there were a lot of great big issues covered at this summit, including between the two Presidents last night, and Chechnya was one of them. And we came back to it today in the larger format as well.
And I would say, as for the substance, it was pretty well captured in the press conference this afternoon. Certainly the essence of President Clinton's view and attitude on the subject.
Q: Strobe, just one quick one. Did they discuss at all Russian organized crime in this country and in the United States?
DEPUTY SECRETARY TALBOTT: Bill, the issue of -- to give it its negative name, corruption, and its positive name, the need for a rule of law as an underpinning of Russian reform -- was a theme. It's a theme on which President Clinton was very candid. And President Putin was very candid and forceful. And it came up particularly during the economic plenary with some of the economic advisors and ministers joining this afternoon.
Q: What did they decide?
DEPUTY SECRETARY TALBOTT: Serious problem, got to work on it together, like a number of others I could mention.
Thank you very much.

Bill Clinton,"June 04, 2000",The President's News Conference With President Vladimir Putin of Russia in Moscow,"President Putin. Good day, ladies and gentlemen. I will allow myself to begin summing up our 2 days of work with our guests and partners, with the President of the United States, Mr. Bill Clinton, and members of his team. For 2 days now, we worked very intensively. And I have to say right off the bat that both in terms of the spirit and the quality of our talks, as well as the results, the Russian side cannot but express its satisfaction.
We discussed issues of interest in our opinion not only to the United States and the Russian Federation but to the other countries, as well, on global matters—all of mankind's interest really lies here. We discussed in great detail everything that had been done in this very important—issues of interest to both of our sides, and that which have been in the last several years. We agree that we're going to be acting in this direction jointly in the future.
We discussed the issues of new global threats, threats such as terrorism, narcotics, crime. We talked about issues which, to our mind, have a certain solution; in the estimation of our American colleagues, maybe have a different kind of a solution. We exchanged ideas and opinions on issues to which we had different solutions in the past. These talks were very candid, very open, and very topical.
As you know, with my colleague, with the President of the United States, I signed several documents, including statements on security. And many things are determined and defined there, and much is said in these documents. The result I think can be summed up by saying that we not only confirmed the high level of our relations, but we also expressed the trend of the development of our relations between our two countries for the near future.
I wanted to stress here, ladies and gentlemen, the following, that over the last period of time, say a year or even more, the relations between our two countries have been of a varied kind. At one time, we had relations increasing and improving; then they would be falling. But that high level which was reached over the last 8 years by the efforts of the Russian leadership and of the administration of President Clinton allowed us to always find a way out of these crises with honor, not only to reestablish good relations but also to solve problems where we had disagreements. And we really cherish this. I am pleased to note here that in these very tough questions, we observed not only a desire to speak but also to find joint and mutually beneficial solutions.
We discussed also topics that had to do with bilateral economic interests. Here I wanted to say that the Russian Federation, in the face of your humble servant and the Chairman of the Government, the Prime Minister, Mr. Kasyanov, the leading ministers of the Government who participated and took part in these talks and negotiations, not only informed and described to our American guests what's happening economically in Russia today but also discussed with our partners joint actions, joint activities, both of a bilateral nature as well as within the framework of international financial institutions.
I wanted to stress here as well that the Russian Federation aims not only to go through its transformation, about which many people have so much spoken, but very decisively to do so in a practical way. I mean moving ahead on the tax code and moving ahead on production sharing. Here we have some issues which we have not yet been able to resolve between us and the State Duma, but I think these are rather technical issues. I think, together with the Deputies in the State Duma, we're going to be trying to find solutions and finally get this legislation.
We spoke about the upcoming international events, the Okinawa summit, the Millennium summit in the United Nations in New York, the Brunei meeting. In this way, Mr. Clinton and myself, we have reached an accord on further joint progress along a whole series of issues, which not only we discussed today and yesterday and which we will still have an opportunity to discuss some more tomorrow, to move ahead on these issues at the events that I have listed.
On behalf of the leadership of the Russian Federation, I want to thank the American delegation not only for accepting our invitation and coming to Russia but for a very constructive and businesslike discussion in an attempt to find solutions.
Thank you so much for your attention.
President Clinton. I would like to first thank President Putin and the Russian delegation for making us feel welcome and for these talks.
I have come to Moscow at an important time. Russia, after all, has a new President, new government, new Duma. Its economy is showing encouraging signs of growth. This gives Russia a pivotal opportunity to build on the strong record of engagement between our two countries. It is also an opportunity for the United States.
I welcome President Putin's interest in building a Russia that enjoys the enduring strength of a stable democracy. President Yeltsin led Russia to freedom. Under President Putin, Russia has the chance to build prosperity and strength, while safeguarding that freedom and the rule of law.
We've had good discussions both last night and today on a range of common interests, including nonproliferation and arms control. We expressed our differences with clarity and candor. And I, for one, appreciate that. The importance of this relationship to ourselves and the world demands that we take every opportunity we can to find common ground and that, where we cannot find it, we express our differences with clarity and candor.
I congratulated President Putin on the key role he played in the Duma's ratification of START II and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. The United States ratified START II first, and I hope we will now follow Russia in ratifying the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. I also look forward to the ratification of the START II protocols by our Senate so that we can get about the business of further reducing the number of nuclear missiles that we have.
I am very pleased today we agreed on two other major steps to reduce the nuclear danger. We reached an important agreement each to destroy 34 tons of military-grade plutonium, enough to make thousands of warheads—this raw weapon material that will now never fall into the wrong hands.
We also agreed to establish a joint data exchange center in Moscow to share early warning information on missile and space launches. This is terribly important. It is the first permanent U.S.-Russia military operation ever. In this new center, Russian and American military officials will be working side by side, 24 hours a day, to monitor missile warning information. It is a milestone in enhancing strategic stability, and I welcome it.
The President and I also discussed our common commitment to prevent the proliferation of missile technology and our determination to exert firm control over exports of sensitive technology and strictly enforce export control laws and regulations.
We discussed our common interest in commercial space cooperation, including the successful joint venture that launches commercial satellites. We agreed that our teams would soon meet to discuss future cooperation in the commercial space area, with the aim of moving toward eliminating existing constraints on commercial space launches.
We also had a thorough discussion of our work on the START III treaty and the issue of national missile defense. We have agreed to a statement of principles, which I urge you to read carefully. It makes clear that there is an emerging ballistic missile threat that must be addressed, though we have not yet agreed on how best to do so.
We have acknowledged that the ABM Treaty foresees the possibility of changes in the strategic environment that might require it to be updated. We have reaffirmed our commitment to pursue further reduction in offensive arms in parallel with our discussions on defense systems, underscoring the importance of the doctrines of strategic stability and mutual deterrence as the foundation for this work.
We've asked our experts to keep working to narrow the differences and to develop a series of cooperative measures to address the missile threat. And we have agreed that we will continue to discuss it in our next meeting.
We spent a large share of our time discussing economics. I'm encouraged by the economic plan President Putin has outlined and by the current recovery. I look forward to Russia's continuing to implement proposed reforms that will actually make the recovery last, reforms such as tax reform, anti-money-laundering legislation, strong property rights protections.
I look forward to Russia's successful negotiations with the IMF. This is a good economic team with a very good opportunity to increase investment in Russia, both the return of money that Russians have placed outside the country and new investments from other countries.
Later this month, our former Ambassador to Moscow, Bob Strauss, will come to Russia with a delegation of investors, including some of America's best-known chief executive officers, to discuss opportunities in Russia and the steps Russia is taking to improve its investment climate. I think this will be only the beginning of a very successful effort at economic reform, if the intentions that President Putin outlined become reality.
The President and I also discussed another area where we disagree, Chechnya. I have restated the opposition that I have to a policy which is well-known. Essentially, I believe a policy that causes so many civilian casualties without a political solution ultimately cannot succeed. I also urged President Putin to move forward with transparent and impartial investigations of the stories of human rights violations and to authorize a speedy return of the OSCE to the region.
Finally, I stressed to President Putin the importance the United States places on protecting religious freedom and the rights of an independent media. I strongly agree with what President Putin himself has said, that Russia has no future if it suppresses civic freedoms and the press.
We agreed to advance our technical cooperation on climate change. We believe it's essential to complete work on the Kyoto Protocol, including market mechanisms, to protect the environment, promote clean energy, and reduce costs. I think Russia has a great economic opportunity here as well as a great environmental one.
And on these issues, the President and I are asking the U.S.-Russia binational commission, under the leadership of Vice President Gore and Prime Minister Kasyanov, to carry forward the work.
I was encouraged by our discussion, pleased with our agreements, pleased with the candor and clarity of our disagreements. I am eager for more progress. I'm also looking forward to the chance to talk to the Russian people tonight, in a radio talk show, and tomorrow, as I have the opportunity to speak to the Duma and the Federation Council.
Again, Mr. President, I thank you for this and especially for these two agreements, and I look forward to our continued work together.
Russia-U.S. Relations
Q. The question to the President of Russia. What is the priority you give to Russian-American relations in the world, and a world that, as we see, is changing and forming in a different way?
Thank you.
President Putin. The history of relations of the former Soviet Union and the United States of America, and now Russian Federation and the United States—its history, as I've said, has many dramatic as well as many positive elements. We were allies. There was a period of time when we suffered through confrontation between our two sides. One would hope that the very worst in our relations is far, far behind us.
For today, the United States is one of our main partners. And as far as Russia is concerned, it will never make the choice regarding the United States in order to start once again confrontation. Never. We are for cooperation. We are for coming to agreement on problems that might arise.
And naturally, problems like this exist and have existed and probably will exist. That is not important. What's important is that the approach to finding a solution is only one—it's unique— it cannot be aimed at destroying everything positive that has been achieved in the recent past but also looking into the future. And this kind of chance and this intention among the leadership of Russia, as well as I understand it, among the leadership of the United States, the President of the United States, we are going to follow these principles, these kinds of tendencies.
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty
Q. Mr. President, do you see the chance that the United States would exercise its option to withdraw from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty if it is not possible to negotiate changes to permit a national missile defense? And was this possibility raised in your discussions with President Putin?
President Clinton. Well, first of all, I have not made a decision on the national missile defense stage one. It is premature. The statement of principles that we have agreed to I thought reflected an attempt to bring our positions closer together. I do not believe the decision before me is a threat to strategic stability and mutual deterrence. The Russian side disagrees. But we had a lot of agreement here.And again, let me say, I urge you all to read that.
I do not want the United States to withdraw from the ABM regime, because I think it has contributed to a more stable, more peaceful world. It has already been amended once, and its framers understood that circumstances might change and threats might arise which were outside the context of U.S.-now Russian relations. We acknowledge that there is a threat. It needs to be met, and we're trying to bridge our differences. And I think that's where we ought to leave it.
START Treaties
Q. President Clinton, Mr. President, what do you feel about Russia's continuation of reducing within START III the number of warheads down to 1,500 warheads?
Thank you.
President Clinton. I missed the translation. Would you give it to me again?
Q. What would be the attitude of the United States, Mr. President, on the Russian position of coming down to 1,500 warheads within START III?
President Clinton. Well, we had previously agreed to a range of 2,000 to 2,500 on START III. If we were to come down below that, it would require us to change our strategic plan. And we believe it would be much better if we were going to do that, if we could also know that we were defending ourselves against a new threat, which we believe is real. So we will continue to discuss all these things.
Let me say, I am certain—I am eager to get down to the START II levels, and I am eager to go below the START II levels, but I also want to try to solve the new threat, as well. And I will do whatever I can to achieve both objectives.
Clinton/Putin Relationship
Q. This is for both Presidents. Now that you have met together as Presidents, how would you describe each other's personalities and leadership qualities? And how do you see them affecting relations between the two countries? And in particular, President Clinton, are you any more or less assured about the future of democracy in Russia following your meetings today?
President Clinton. You want to go first?
President Putin. As you know, this is not our first meeting, between myself and President Clinton. President Clinton, now for almost 8 years, heads one of the most powerful countries in the world. He's a very experienced politician. In my mind, we've established now not only good business ties but also personal relations. For me, President Clinton is a person who is a very comfortable and pleasant partner in negotiations.
I think that if everyone behaves the way President Clinton has behaved, not trying to find dead ends and problems but to seek ways of moving ahead, I think, between us in the future our relations really will be successful. Take a look at the ABM Treaty. There are a lot of problems there. We've written down in our statement, about which Mr. Clinton just spoke, a basis, a principle of basis for maintaining the ABM Treaty as a major key point in the whole strategic balance and for maintaining security.
Now, the starting point for the possibility of seeing new threats arrive, we have a commonality. We're against having a cure which is worse than the disease. We understand that there are ways and a basis that we can build upon in order to solve even this issue, an issue which seems to be one of the most difficult to solve.
So I repeat, we know that today, in the United States, there is a campaign ongoing. We're familiar with the programs of the two main candidates. And if these programs are implemented, and there it says, for instance, the necessity to positively improve relations between Russia and the United States, the time that Mr. Clinton is going to pass on to the next President, no matter who gets to be President, we're willing to go forward on either one of these approaches.
Thank you.
President Clinton. Well, let me say first, I think President Putin has an enormous opportunity and a great challenge. If you want to know what my personal assessment is, I think he is fully capable of building a prosperous, strong Russia, while preserving freedom and pluralism and the rule of law. It's a big challenge. I think he is fully capable of doing it.
And I want to use the time I have remaining as President not only to further the interests of the United States in meeting our national security threat but also to further our interest in having a good, stable relationship with a Russia that is strong and prosperous and free, respecting pluralism and the rule of law. That's what I'm trying to do. I think he is fully capable of achieving that. And I'm encouraged by the first 2 days of our really serious work.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-president-vladimir-putin-russia-moscow
Bill Clinton,"June 05, 2000",Remarks to the Russian State Duma in Moscow,"First of all, I thank you for that introduction. And even though it is still in the morning, I am delighted to be here with the Members of the State Duma and the Federation Council.
It is important to me to have this opportunity because the prospects for virtually every important initiative President Putin and I have discussed over the last 2 days will obviously depend upon your advice and your consent, and because through you I can speak to the citizens of Russia directly, those whom you represent.
I have made five trips to Russia in my years as President. I have worked with President Yeltsin and now with President Putin. I have met with the leadership of the Duma on more than one occasion. I have spoken with Russia's religious leaders, with the media, with educators, scientists, and students. I have listened to Russian people tell me about their vision of the future, and I have tried to be quite open about my own vision of the future. I have come here at moments of extraordinary optimism about Russia's march toward prosperity and freedom, and I've been here at moments of great difficulty for you.
I believed very strongly from the first time I came here that Russia's future fundamentally is in the hands of the Russian people. It cannot be determined by others, and it should not be. But Russia's future is very important to others, because it is among the most important journeys the world will witness in my lifetime. A great deal of the 21st century will be strongly influenced by the success of the Russian people in building a modern, strong, democratic nation that is part of the life of the rest of the world. And so, many people across the world have sought to support your efforts, sharing with you a sense of pride when democracy is advanced and sharing your disappointment when difficulties arose.
It is obviously not for me to tell the Russian people how to interpret the last few years. I know your progress has come with unfilled expectations and unexpected difficulties. I know there have been moments, especially during the financial crisis in 1998, when some wondered if the new Russia would end up as a grand social experiment gone wrong.
But when we look at Russia today, we do not see an experiment gone wrong. We see an economy that is growing, producing goods and services people want. We see a nation of enterprising citizens who are beginning, despite all of the obstacles, to bring good jobs and a normal life to their communities. We see a society with 65,000 nongovernmental organizations, like Eco-Juris, which is helping citizens defend their rights in court; like Vozrozhdenie, which is aiding families with disabled children; like the local chambers of commerce that have sprung up all across Russia.
We see a country of people taking responsibility for their future, people like those of Gadzhiyevo on the Arctic Circle who organized a referendum to protect the environment of their town. We see a country transforming its system of higher education to meet the demands of the modern world, with institutions like the new Law Factory at Novgorod University and the New Economic School in Moscow.
We see a country preserving its magnificent literary heritage, as the Pushkin Library is doing in its efforts to replenish the shelves of libraries all across Russia. We see a country entering the information age, with cutting-edge software companies, with Internet centers at universities from Kazan to Ufa to Yakutsk, with a whole generation of young people more connected to the outside world than any past generation could have imagined.
We see Russian citizens with no illusions about the road ahead, yet voting in extraordinary numbers against a return to the past. We see a Russia that has just completed a democratic transfer of executive power for the first time in 1,000 years.
I would not presume to tell the people you represent how to weigh the gains of freedom against the pain of economic hardship, corruption, crime. I know the people of Russia do not yet have the Russia they were promised in 1991. But I believe you, and they, now have a realistic chance to build that kind of Russia for yourselves in far greater measure than a decade ago, because of the democratic foundations that have been laid and the choices that have been made.
The world faces a very different Russia than it did in 1991. Like all countries, Russia also faces a very different world. Its defining feature is globalization, the tearing down of boundaries between people, nations, and cultures, so that what happens anywhere can have an impact everywhere.
During the 1990's, the volume of international trade almost doubled. Links among businesses, universities, advocacy groups, charities, and churches have multiplied across physical space and cyberspace. In the developing world, some of the poorest villages are beginning to be connected to the information superhighway in ways that are opening up unbelievable opportunities for education and for development.
The Russian people did more than just about anyone else to make possible this new world of globalization by ending the divisions of the cold war. Now Russia, America, and all nations are subject to new rules of the global economy. One of those rules, to adapt a phrase from your history, is that it's no longer possible to build prosperity in one country alone. To prosper, our economies must be competitive in a global marketplace; and to compete, the most important resource we must develop is our own people, giving them the tools and freedom to reach their full potential.
This is the challenge we have tried to meet in America over the last few years. Indeed, the changes we have seen in the global economy pose hard questions that both our nations still must answer. A fundamental question is, how do we define our strength and vitality as a nation today, and what role should government play in building it?
Some people actually believe that government is no longer relevant at all to people's lives in a globalized, interconnected world. Since all of us hold government positions, I presume we disagree. But I believe experience shows that government, while it must be less bureaucratic and more oriented toward the markets and while it should focus on empowering people by investing in education and training rather than simply accruing power for itself, it is still very important.
Above all, a strong state should use its strength to reinforce the rule of law, protect the powerless against the powerful, defend democratic freedoms, including freedom of expression, religion, and the press, and do whatever is possible to give everyone a chance to develop his or her innate abilities.
This is true, I believe, for any society seeking to advance in the modern world. For any society in any part of the world that is increasingly small and tied together, the answer to law without order is not order without law.
Another fundamental question is, how shall countries define their strength in relation to the rest of the world today? Shall we define it as the power to dominate our neighbors or the confidence to be a good neighbor? Shall we define it by what we are against or simply in terms of what others are for? Do we join with others in common endeavors to advance common interests, or do we try to bend others to our will?
This federal assembly's ratification of START II and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty suggests you are answering these questions in a way that will make for both a stronger Russia and a better world, defining your strength in terms of the achievements of your people and the power of your partnerships and your role in world affairs.
A related question for both Russia and America is, how should we define our relationship today? Clearly, Russia has entered a phase when what it needs most is outside investment, not aid. What Americans must ask is not so much what can we do for Russia, but what can we do with Russia to advance our common interests and lift people in both nations?
To build that kind of relationship, we Americans have to overcome the temptation to think that we have all the answers. We have to resist the feeling that if only you would see things our way, troubles would go away. Russia will not, and indeed should not, choose a course simply because others wish you to do so. You will choose what your interests clearly demand and what your people democratically embrace.
I think one problem we have is that many Russians still suspect that America does not wish you well. Thus, you tend to see our relationship in what we call zero-sum terms, assuming that every assertion of American power must diminish Russia, and every assertion of Russian strength must threaten America. That is not true. The United States wants a strong Russia, a Russia strong enough to protect its territorial integrity while respecting that of its neighbors, strong enough to meet threats to its security, to help maintain strategic stability, to join with others to meet common goals, to give its people their chance to live their dreams.
Of course, our interests are not identical, and we will have our inevitable disagreements. But on many issues that matter to our people, our interests coincide. And we have an obligation, it seems to me, to focus on the goals we can and should advance together in our mutual interest and to manage our differences in a responsible and respectful way.
What can we do together in the years to come? Well, one thing we ought to do is to build a normal economic relationship, based on trade and investment between our countries and contact between our people. We have never had a better opportunity, and I hope you will do what you can to seize it.
This is the time, when Russia's economy is growing and oil prices are high, when I hope Russia will create a more diversified economy. The economies that will build power in the 21st century will be built not just on resources from the soil, which are limited, but on the genius and initiative of individual citizens, which are unlimited.
This is a time when I hope you will finish putting in place the institutions of a modern economy, with laws that protect property, that ensure openness and accountability, that establish an efficient, equitable tax code. Such an economy would keep Russian capital in Russia and bring foreign capital to Russia, both necessary for the kind of investment you deserve, to create jobs for your people and new businesses for your future.
This is a time to win the fight against crime and corruption so that investment will not choose safer shores. That is why I hope you will soon pass a strong law against money laundering that meets international standards.
This is also the time I hope Russia will make an all-out effort to take the needed steps to join the World Trade Organization. Membership in the WTO reinforces economic reform. It will give you better access to foreign markets. It will ensure that your trading partners treat you fairly. Russia should not be the only major industrialized country standing outside this global trading system. You should be inside this system, with China, Brazil, Japan, members of the European Union, and the United States, helping to shape those rules for the benefit of all.
We will support you. But you must know, too, that the decision to join the WTO requires difficult choices that only you can make. I think it is very important. Again I will say, I think you should be part of making the rules of the road for the 21st century economy, in no small measure because I know you believe in the importance of the social contract, and you understand that we cannot have a world economy unless we also have some rules that people in the world respect regarding the living standards of people, the conditions in which our children are raised, whether they have access to education, and whether we do what should be done together to protect the global environment.
A second goal of our partnership should be to meet threats to our security together. The same advances that are bringing the world together are also making the tools of destruction deadlier, cheaper, and more available. As you well know, because of this openness of borders, because of the openness of the Internet, and because of the advances of technology, we are all more vulnerable to terrorism, to organized crime, to the spread of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons—which themselves may someday be transferred, soon, in smaller and smaller quantities, across more and more borders, by unscrupulous illegal groups working together. In such a world, to protect our security we must have more cooperation, not more competition, among like-minded nation-states.
Since 1991, we have already cooperated to cut our own nuclear arsenals by 40 percent; in removing nuclear weapons from Belarus, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan; in fighting illicit trafficking in deadly technology. Together, we extended the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, banned chemical weapons, agreed to end nuclear testing, urged India and Pakistan to back away from nuclear confrontation.
Yesterday President Putin and I announced two more important steps. Each of us will destroy 34 tons of weapons-grade plutonium, enough to build thousands of nuclear weapons. And we will establish a system to give each other early warning of missile tests and space launches to avoid any miscalculation, with a joint center here that will operate out of Moscow 24 hours a day, 7 days a week—the first permanent, joint United States-Russian military cooperation ever. I am proud of this record, and I hope you are, too.
We will continue to reduce our nuclear arsenals by negotiating a START III treaty and to secure the weapons and materials that remain. But we must be realistic. Despite our best efforts, the possibility exists that nuclear and other deadly weapons will fall into dangerous hands, into hands that could threaten us both—rogue states, terrorists, organized criminal groups. The technology required to launch missiles capable of delivering them over long distances, unfortunately, is still spreading across the world.
The question is not whether this threat is emerging; it is. The question is, what is the best way to deal with it? It is my strong preference that any response to strengthen the strategic stability and arms control regime that has served our two nations so well for decades now—if we can pursue that goal together, we will all be more secure.
Now, as all of you know well, soon I will be required to decide whether the United States should deploy a limited national defense system designed to protect the American people against the most imminent of these threats. I will consider, as I have repeatedly said, many factors, including the nature of threat, the cost of meeting it, the effectiveness of the available technology, and the impact of this decision on our overall security, including our relationship with Russia and other nations, and the need to preserve the ABM Treaty.
The system we are contemplating would not undermine Russia's deterrent or the principles of mutual deterrence and strategic stability. That is not a question just of our intent but of the technical capabilities of the system. But I ask you to think about this, to debate it, as I know you will, to determine for yourselves what the capacity of what we have proposed is. Because I learned on my trip to Russia that the biggest debate is not whether we intend to do something that will undermine mutual deterrence; I think most people who have worked with us, not just me and others, over the years know that we find any future apart from cooperation with you in the nuclear area inconceivable. The real question is a debate over what the impact of this will be, because of the capacity of the technology involved.
And I believe that is a question of fact which people of good will ought to be able to determine. And I believe we ought to be able to reach an agreement about how we should proceed at each step along the way here, in a way that preserves mutual deterrence, preserves strategic stability, and preserves the ABM Treaty. That is my goal. And if we can reach an agreement about how we're going forward, then it is something we ought to take in good faith to the Chinese, to the Japanese, to others who are interested in this, to try to make sure that this makes a safer world, not a more unstable world.
I think we've made some progress, and I would urge all of you who are interested in this to carefully read the Statement of Principles to which President Putin and I agreed yesterday.
Let me say that this whole debate on missile defense and the nature of the threat reflects a larger and, I think, more basic truth. As we and other nation-states look out on the world today, increasingly we find that the fundamental threat to our security is not the threat that we pose to each other, but instead, threats we face in common—threats from terrorist and rogue states, from biological, chemical, and nuclear weapons which may be able to be produced in increasingly smaller and more sophisticated ways; public health threats, like AIDS and tuberculosis, which are now claiming millions of lives around the world and which literally are on the verge of ruining economies and threatening the survival of some nations. The world needs our leadership in this fight, as well. And when President Putin and I go to the G-8 meeting in July, I hope we can support a global strategy against infectious disease.
There is a global security threat caused by environmental pollution and global warming. We must meet it with strong institutions at home and with leadership abroad.
Fortunately, one of the benefits of the globalized information age is that it is now possible to grow an economy without destroying the environment. Thanks to incredible advances in science and technology over the last 10 years, a whole new aspect in economic growth has opened up. It only remains to see whether we are wise enough to work together to do this, because the United States does not have the right to ask any nation—not Russia, not China, not India—to give up future economic growth to combat the problem of climate change. What we do have is the opportunity to persuade every nation, including people in our own country who don't yet believe it, that we can grow together in the 21st century and actually reduce greenhouse gases at the same time.
I think a big part of making that transition benefits Russia, because of your great stores of natural gas. And so I hope we will be working closely together on this in the years ahead.
In the Kyoto climate change treaty, we committed ourselves to tie market forces to the fight against global warming. And today, on this World Environment Day, I'm pleased that President Putin and I have agreed to deepen our own cooperation on climate change.
This is a huge problem. If we don't deal with this within just a few years, you will have island nations flooded; you will have the agricultural balance of most countries completely changed; you will have a dramatic increase in the number of severe, unmanageable weather events. And the good news is that we can now deal with this problem—again I say—and strengthen our economic growth, not weaken it.
A third challenge that demands our engagement is the need to build a world that is less divided along ethnic, racial, and religious lines. It is truly ironic, I think, that we can go anywhere in the world and have the same kinds of conversations about the nature of the global information society. Not long ago, I was in India in a poor village, meeting with a women's milk cooperative. And the thing they wanted me to see was that they had computerized all their records. And then I met with the local village council, and the thing they wanted me to see in this remote village, in a nation with a per capita income of only $450 a year, was that all the information that the federal and state government had that any citizen could ever want was on a computer in the public building in this little village. And I watched a mother that had just given birth to a baby come into this little public building and call up the information about how to care for the child and then print it out on her computer, so that she took home with her information every bit as good as a well-to-do American mother could get from her doctor about how to care for a child in the first 6 months.
It is truly ironic that at a time when we're living in this sort of world with all these modern potentials, that we are grappling with our oldest problems of human society—our tendency to fear and then to hate people who are different from us. We see it from Northern Ireland to the Middle East to the tribal conflicts of Africa to the Balkans and many other places on this Earth.
Russia and America should be concerned about this because the stability of both of our societies depends upon people of very different ethnic, racial, and religious groups learning to live together under a common framework of rules. And history teaches us that harmony that lasts among such different people cannot be maintained by force alone.
I know when trying to come to grips with these problems, these old problems of the modern world, the United States and Russia have faced some of our greatest difficulties in the last few years. I know you disagreed with what I did in Kosovo, and you know that I disagreed with what you did in Chechnya. I have always said that the Russian people and every other people have a right to combat terrorism and to preserve the integrity of their nations. I still believe it, and I reaffirmed that today. My question in Chechnya was an honest one and the question of a friend, and that is whether any war can be won that requires large numbers of civilian casualties and has no political component bringing about a solution.
Let me say, in Kosovo my position was whether we could ever preserve a democratic and free Europe unless southeastern Europe were a part of it, and whether any people could ever say that everyone is entitled to live in peace if 800,000 people were driven out of a place they had lived in for centuries solely because of their religion.
None of these questions will be easy, but I think we ought to ask ourselves whether we are trying to resolve them. I remember going to Kosovo after the conflict, after Russians and Americans had agreed to serve there together as we have served in Bosnia effectively together, and sitting down with all the people who represented the conflict around the table. They would hardly speak to each other. They were still angry; they were still thinking about their family members that had been dislocated and killed.
So I said to them that I had just been involved in negotiating the end of the conflict in Northern Ireland, and that I was very close to the Irish conflict because all of my relatives came from a little village in Ireland that was right on the border between the north and the south, and therefore had lived through all these years of conflict between the Catholics and the Protestants.
And I said, ""Now here's the deal we've got. The deal is: majority rule, minority rights, guaranteed participation in decisionmaking, shared economic and other benefits."" Majority rule, minority rights, guaranteed participation in decisionmaking, shared economic and other benefits. I said, ""Now, it's a good deal, but what I would like to tell you is that if they had ever stopped fighting, they could have gotten this deal years ago.""
And so I told the people of Kosovo, I said, ""You know, everybody around this table has got a legitimate grievance. People on all sides, you can tell some story that is true and is legitimately true. Now, you can make up your mind to bear this legitimate grievance with a grudge for 20 or 30 years. And 20 or 30 years from now, someone else will be sitting in these chairs, and they will make a deal: majority rule, minority rights, shared decisionmaking, shared economic and other benefits. You can make the deal now, or you can wait.""
Those of us who are in a position of strong and stable societies, we have to say this to people. We have to get people—not just the people who have been wronged; everybody has got a legitimate grievance in these caldrons of ethnic and racial and religious turmoil. But it's something we have to think about. And as we see a success story, it's something I think we ought to look for other opportunities to advance.
Real peace in life comes not when you give up the feelings you have that are wrong, but when you give up the feelings you have that are right, in terms of having been wronged in the past. That's how people finally come together and go on. And those of us who lead big countries should take that position and try to work through it.
Let me say, finally, a final security goal that I have, related to all the others, is to help Europe build a community that is democratic, at peace, and without divisions—one that includes Russia and strengthens our ability to advance our common interest. We have never had that kind of Europe before in all of history, so building it will require changing old patterns of thinking. I was in Germany a couple of days ago in the historic old town of Aachen, where Charlemagne had his European empire in the late 8th and early 9th centuries, to talk about that.
There are, I know, people who resist the idea that Russia should be part of Europe and who insist that Russia is fundamentally different from the other nations that are building a united Europe. Of course, there are historical and cultural arguments that support that position. And it's a good thing that you are different and that we are different; it makes life more interesting. But the differences between Russia and France, for example, may not be any greater than those between Sweden and Spain, or England and Greece, or even between America and Europe. Integration within Europe and then the transatlantic alliance came about because people who are different came together, not because people who are the same came together.
Estrangement between Russia and the West, which lasted too long, was not because of our inherent differences but because we made choices in how we defined our interests and our belief systems. We now have the power to choose a different and a better future. We can do that by integrating our economies, making common cause against common threats, promoting ethnic and religious tolerance and human rights. We can do it by making sure that none of the institutions of European and transatlantic unity, not any of them, are closed to Russia.
You can decide whether you want to be a part of these institutions. It should be entirely your decision. And we can have the right kind of constructive partnership, whatever decision we make, as long as you know that no doors to Europe's future are closed to you, and you can then feel free to decide how best to pursue your own interests. If you choose not to pursue full membership in these institutions, then we must make sure that their eastern borders become gateways for Russia instead of barriers to travel, trade, and security cooperation.
We also should work with others to help those in Europe who still fear violence and are afraid they will not have a stable, secure future. I am proud that together we have made the OSCE into an effective champion of human rights in Europe. I am pleased that President Putin and I recommitted ourselves yesterday to helping find a settlement to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. I am proud we have together adapted the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty, to reduce conventional arms in Europe and eliminate the division of the continent into military blocs. I believe it is a hopeful thing that despite our different outlook on the war in the former Yugoslavia, that our armed forces have worked there together in both Bosnia and Kosovo to keep the peace.
We may still disagree about Kosovo, but now that the war is over, let me say one other thing about Yugoslavia. I believe the people of Serbia deserve to live in a normal country with the same freedoms the people of Russia and America enjoy, with relationships with their neighbors, including Russia, that will not constantly be interrupted by vast flows of innocent people being forced out of their country or threatened with their very lives.
The struggle in Belgrade now is not between Serbia and NATO. It is between the Serbian people and their leaders. The Serbian people are asking the world to back democracy and freedom. Our response to their request does not have to be identical, but Russia and America should both be on the side of the people of Serbia.
In the relationship we are building, we should try to stand abroad for the values each of us has been building at home. I know the kind of relationship that we would both like cannot be built overnight. Russia's history, like America's, teaches us well that there are no shortcuts to great achievements. But we have laid strong foundations. It has helped a great deal that so many Members of our Congress have visited you here, and that a number of Duma committee chairmen visited our Congress last month, that members of the Federation Council have been invited to come to Washington.
I want to urge you, as many of you as can, to visit our country and invite Members of our Congress to visit you. Let them understand how the world looks from your perspective. Let them see how you do your jobs. Tell them what you're worried about and where you disagree with us. And give us a chance to build that base of common experience and mutual trust that is so important to our future together. All of you are always welcome to come and work with us in the United States. We have to find a mutual understanding.
I also would say that the most important Russian-American relationship still should be the relationship between our peoples, the student exchanges, the business partnerships, the collaboration among universities and foundations and hospitals, the sister-city links, the growing family ties. Many of the Russians and Americans involved in these exchanges are very young. They don't even have any adult memories of the cold war. They don't carry the burdens and baggage of the past, just the universal, normal desire to build a good future with those who share their hopes and dreams. We should do everything we can to increase these exchanges, as well.
And finally, we must have a sense of responsibility for the future. We are not destined to be adversaries, but it is not guaranteed that we will be allies. For us, there is no fate waiting to be revealed, only a future waiting to be created by the actions we take, the choices we make, and the genuine views we have of one another and of our own future.
I leave you today looking to the future with the realistic hope that we will choose wisely; that we will continue to build a relationship of mutual respect and mutual endeavor; that we will tell each other the truth with clarity and candor as we see it, always striving to find common ground, always remembering that the world we seek to bring into being can come only if America and Russia are on the same side of history.
I believe we will do this, not because I know everything always turns out well but because I know our partnership, our relationship, is fundamentally the right course for both nations. We have to learn to identify and manage our disagreements because the relationship is profoundly important to the future.
The governments our people elect will do what they think is right for their own people. But they know that one thing that is right is continuing to strengthen the relationship between Russia and the United States. Our children will see the result, a result that is more prosperous and free and at peace than the world has ever known. That is what I believe we can do.
I don't believe any American President has ever come to Russia five times before. I came twice before that, once when I was a very young man and our relations were very different than they are now. All my life, I have wanted the people of my country and the people of your country to be friends and allies, to lead the world away from war toward the dreams of children. I have done my best to do that.
I hope you will believe that that is the best course for both our countries and for our children's future.
Thank you very much.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-russian-state-duma-moscow
Bill Clinton,"June 26, 2000","Statement of Administration Policy: S. 2522 - Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Bill, FY 2001","STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(Senate)
(Sponsors: Stevens (R), Alaska; McConnell (R), Kentucky)
This Statement of Administration Policy provides the Administration's views on S. 2522, the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Bill, FY 2001, as reported by the Senate Appropriations Committee. Your consideration of the Administration's views would be appreciated.
The President has requested urgently needed supplemental funding to fight against drug production and trafficking in Colombia, to provide disaster assistance to victims of hurricanes and floods in the United States and abroad, to lift crippling debt burdens for the world's poorest countries, and to sustain our military and civilian operations in Kosovo and the region, thereby protecting military readiness. Funding for UN peacekeeping and other stabilization measures in Kosovo is especially important to the eventual successful withdrawal of U.S. troops. The House passed emergency supplemental legislation addressing some of these urgent needs on March 30th.
Regrettably, the President's supplemental request has moved slowly in the Senate and now appears to be bogged down by a number of controversial provisions. These include provisions that would severely hinder the Federal Government's pending tobacco litigation, significant cuts to key international programs, as well as a number of anti-environmental riders and other objectionable provisions. Moreover, the Senate has fragmented our consolidated request into separate bills, slowing the process dramatically and jeopardizing this urgently needed funding. If a bill containing such provisions listed above were presented to the President, the President's senior advisers would recommend that he veto the bill.
The President's FY 2001 Budget is based on a balanced approach that maintains fiscal discipline, eliminates the national debt, extends the solvency of Social Security and Medicare, provides for an appropriately sized tax cut, establishes a new voluntary Medicare prescription drug benefit, in the context of broader reforms, expands health care coverage to more families, and funds critical investments for our future. An essential element of this approach is ensuring adequate funding for discretionary programs. To this end, the President has proposed discretionary spending limits at levels that we believe are necessary to serve the American people.
Unfortunately, the FY 2001 congressional budget resolution provides inadequate resources for discretionary investments. We need realistic levels of funding for critical government functions that the American people expect their government to perform well, including education, national security, law enforcement, environmental protection, preservation of our global leadership, air safety, food safety, economic assistance for the less fortunate, research and technology, and the administration of Social Security and Medicare. Based on the inadequate budget resolution, this bill fails to address critical needs of the American people.
The Administration appreciates efforts by the Committee to accommodate certain of the President's priorities within the 302(b) allocation. However, the inadequacy of the 302(b) allocations has forced the Committee to make choices that are simply unacceptable. As a result, the Committee bill is more than $1.7 billion, or more than 11 percent, below the program level requested by the President. A bill funded at this level would be grossly inadequate to maintain America's leadership around the world. It would inevitably require reductions from previously enacted levels for programs managed by the Departments of State and the Treasury, the Agency for International Development, and others, as well as preclude funding for important new Presidential initiatives. In addition, the bill does not provide urgently needed FY 2000 supplemental funding to provide debt relief to the world's poorest countries for which the President has proposed an offset.
Finally, the bill contains numerous objectionable provisions and a substantial number of earmarks that would seriously limit the President's ability to conduct an effective foreign policy. If the Congress were to enact a bill that does not provide the resources necessary to conduct an effective foreign policy and resolve the significant language problems in the current bill, the President's senior advisers would have no choice but to recommend that he veto the bill.
FY 2001 FOREIGN OPERATIONS LANGUAGE AND FUNDING
Language Issues
As noted above, the bill has numerous objectionable earmarks and language provisions. The following items are particularly objectionable.

    Russia/Chechnya. The Administration shares the concern of the Committee over the Government of Russia's massive use of military force against civilians in Chechnya and continues to push for access for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the International Red Cross, and other observers to investigate possible abuses of human rights. However, the Committee's language cutting off all aid to the Government of Russia if progress is not made on this front would shut down threat reduction and infectious disease programs vital to U.S. national security interests. The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to find a mutually acceptable way to ensure Russia's cooperation in this arena.


    Kosovo Burdensharing. The Administration shares the Committee's goal of ensuring that our allies carry the lion's share of the burden of the costs of reconstruction and recovery in Kosovo. However, the Committee's formula making any U.S. obligations contingent on certification that U.S. contributions do not exceed 15 percent of total obligations and expenditures by all donors is problematic. This approach would cede U.S. sovereignty to foreign nations by handcuffing our contributions to their contributions and it would call U.S. credibility and commitments into question. We have been pressing our European allies vigorously on moving rapidly on their pledges of assistance, and our allies have responded. Making our assistance contingent upon the actions of the international community, however, would hinder our ability to influence events on the ground. We need to move quickly to construct democratic institutions, revive the economy, and reestablish public security, reducing the burden on our troops and the rest of the Kosovo Force (KFOR).


    Early Disbursement for Egypt. The Committee has not included language requested by the President to permit early disbursement of the planned FY 2001 Foreign Military Financing (FMF) outlays for Egypt. The proposed language responds to a House Appropriations Committee report, which calls on the Administration to develop mechanisms that will make our assistance to Egypt more flexible and effective, and a Senate resolution urging the Administration to provide Egypt access to an interest bearing account. The Administration developed a proposal that reflects concerns expressed by the Committee during last year's budget process and meets, we believe, the previously stated congressional objectives.

Constitutional concerns. Several provisions included in the Senate Committee bill, including sections 514, 565(b), and 584(b)(1), purport to direct the vote of United States representatives to international financial bodies. Section 565(g)(3) also purports to infringe upon the President's authority over diplomatic negotiations. These provisions raise serious constitutional concerns regarding the responsibility of the President to formulate the position of the United States in international fora. As such these provisions will be construed as precatory.

  Section 576 ""Kyoto Protocol,"" which purports to prohibit implementation of the Kyoto Protocol is unnecessary, as the Administration has no intention of implementing the Protocol prior to ratification. To the extent that these provisions could be read to prevent the United States from negotiating with foreign governments, it would be inconsistent with the President's Constitutional authority.



  Section 6101(a)(2), provides that ""[t]he Secretary of State shall consult with internationally recognized human rights organizations regarding the Government of Colombia's progress in meeting conditions"" relating to human rights. In order to avoid constitutional concerns regarding the President's sole negotiating authority we would not read this provision to mandate such consultations to the extent that the President determines that such consultations would interfere with his diplomatic initiatives.



  Finally, in order to avoid intrusion into the President's negotiation power and his ability to maintain the confidentiality of sensitive diplomatic negotiations, we would not interpret sections 567 or 6104(a) as requiring the President to disclose either the contents of diplomatic communication or specific plans for particular negotiations in the future.

Funding Issues
As noted above, the Committee bill does not provide sufficient funding for a range of programs.

    International Debt Reduction. The Committee bill cuts the Administration's request of $262 million for debt reduction programs by $187 million, or 71 percent and, as discussed below, also does not fund the supplemental request. Funding at this low level would stall debt relief under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. In particular, the lack of sufficient resources, and authorization, to provide a U.S. contribution to the HIPC Trust Fund would mean that there would be insufficient resources to provide debt relief to many of the poorest reforming countries in Latin America and Africa, in part because other bilateral donors will base their future contributions to the HIPC Trust Fund on a substantial U.S. contribution. This provision is especially troubling in light of the strong, bipartisan action earlier this year by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to authorize the full Administration request. Funding at this level would also significantly limit the ability of the United States to encourage countries to invest in their tropical forests through innovative debt treatment mechanisms under the Tropical Forest Conservation Act (TFCA). Furthermore, it does not provide the advance appropriations requested for multilateral and bilateral debt relief in FY 2002 and FY 2003, respectively.


    Nonproliferation, Anti-terrorism, Demining, and Related Programs . The Senate Committee bill cuts the Administration's request of $311.5 million by $96.5 million, or 31 percent. In particular, the Committee has cut $20 million from the $55 million request for the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO), leaving insufficient funds to purchase necessary shipments of fuel oil, which we are required to provide under the 1995 Agreed Framework. The Committee's recommendation of $20 million for Science Centers in Russia, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan is $25 million, or 56 percent, below the Administration's request and $39 million less than the $59 million provided in FY 2000. This massive reduction would result in less support for scientists with expertise in weapons of mass production, thus increasing the risk they will work with rogue states. The Committee zeroes out the $38 million requested for a new anti-terrorism and security training center and imposes large reductions in Export Control Assistance, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) Preparatory Commission, the Terrorist Interdiction Program, and the important new small arms destruction program, all of which would severely hinder programs to help reduce the threat of proliferation and terrorism.


    Peacekeeping Operations. The bill cuts the Administration's request of $134 million by $49 million, or 37 percent, which would seriously jeopardize our peacekeeping efforts around the world, forcing dramatic cuts to programs such as the U.S. component of the civilian police contingent in East Timor, support for regional peacekeeping initiatives in Africa, and our efforts to train African militaries for peacekeeping operations. Such a reduction would additionally leave us without the means to pay our fair share of Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) mission assessment for elections and governance programs directly supporting the peace processes in Bosnia and Kosovo.


    Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs). The bill cuts the Administration's request of $1.354 billion by $326 million, or 24 percent. This cut would result in an increase of $159 million, or 35 percent, in arrears -- to a total of over $600 million, continuing to reverse the progress made in the FY 1998 and FY 1999 appropriations towards meeting our past-due obligations to these institutions. The impact of lower funding and, in turn, additional arrears has implications for all the MDBs, and in some cases, threatens new operations in the near term. Of specific concern are the proposed cuts to the International Development Association (IDA) ($85.6 million, or 10 percent) and the Global Environment Facility (GEF) ($125.6 million, or 72 percent). These cuts, combined with significant reductions in overall MDB funding, would limit the institutions' ability to achieve U.S. priorities, such as well-targeted support for the poorest, and would undermine our ability to exercise leadership and leverage in these institutions.


    International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement. The bill cuts the Administration's request of $312 million by $92 million, or 29 percent, which would reduce this funding to pre-1999 levels. This would force the State Department to scale back many small programs, such as Caribbean counter-drug initiatives, that had been expanded in accord with congressional direction and funding increases. Taken together with the fact that the bill does not provide the requested $256 million in Plan Colombia funds for FY 2001, this funding cut could represent a large step backward in America's ability to stop drugs at their source. At this critical time, it is important for the United States to maintain its worldwide effort to reduce the plague of drugs on our society.


    Assistance to the Independent States. The bill cuts the Administration's request of $830 million by $55 million, or seven percent. These funding reductions are exacerbated by earmarks that restrict the Administration's flexibility to respond to unforeseen needs. While many of the earmarks are for programs or levels that the Administration and the Committee both support, the combination of earmarks and lower-than-requested funding would hurt our ability to insure that scarce funds go where they will do the most good.


    Economic Support Fund (ESF). The bill cuts the Administration's request of $2.313 billion by $93 million, or four percent. When combined with the Middle East and various other earmarks, this would result in a 22-percent cut to other crucial foreign policy programs, including Indonesia and Nigeria, two of the four countries that the Secretary of State has identified as key transition democracies. In addition, such a cut would have an adverse impact upon regional programs, particularly in Africa, and upon human rights and democracy programs worldwide.


    U.S. Export-Import Bank. The bill cuts the Administration's request of $963 million for program resources by $195 million, or 20 percent, which would reduce the Export-Import Bank's ability to support U.S. exports by 17 percent ($2.6 billion) from the FY 2000 enacted level and by 20 percent ($3.2 billion) from the President's FY 2001 request. Lower export levels translate directly into lower employment opportunities for U.S. workers and lower revenues for U.S. companies. The requested level is necessary to help the Export-Import Bank pay for the higher cost of international lending caused by higher risk levels resulting from the international financial crisis and represents only a modest increase over the Bank's capacity for FY 2000. The Committee's mark, therefore, represents a de facto reduction in the Bank's capacity to support U.S. exports when compared to the FY 2000 enacted level.


    Peace Corps. The bill cuts the Administration's request of $275 million by $55 million, or 20 percent, which would force the Peace Corps to reduce the number of new volunteers by 1,250, effectively reducing the total number of incoming Peace Corps volunteers by 16 percent, to a level not seen since FY 1987. The Peace Corps would also likely be required to close up to 11 Peace Corps posts. A reduction of this magnitude is in stark contrast to the overwhelming bipartisan support shown for the Peace Corps program and would reverse progress toward the 10,000 volunteer level mandated by Congress.

U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). The bill cuts the Administration's request for development assistance and health programs of $2.124 billion by $172 million, or eight percent. Although in the aggregate these programs are increased above the FY 2000 operating year budget level, the large number of directives and earmarks proposed by the Committee for the Development Assistance account, including $100 million in funding for the basic education program -- heretofore appropriated under the Child Survival and Disease Programs account -- would effectively cut other discretionary Development Assistance by almost 19 percent compared to the current year. A cut of this magnitude would severely restrict USAID's ability to support a variety of programs aimed at helping poor countries develop economically, cope with environmental degradation, and support fragile democracies. For example, at the Committee's funding level, it would be impossible to fully fund the Administration's requests for increased assistance to preserve biodiversity in tropical forests and to promote clean energy technology without cutting deeply into these other activities.

  While the Administration appreciates the Committee's increase for international family planning funding to no less than $425 million, we urge the Senate to provide the full request of $541 million, including $484 million to be budgeted from AID's Development Assistance accounts and $57 million requested from other accounts.



  The Committee's decision to increase funding significantly for tuberculosis and malaria, among other things, would result in a 29-percent decrease in funds for other child survival and infectious disease programs compared to the current year. Such reductions would restrict appropriate responses to needs in child survival, other infectious diseases, and development of effective health systems in recipient countries. Although the Administration appreciates the Committee's increase in global HIV/AIDS funding, to $225 million, we urge the Senate to provide the full request of $244 million, thereby demonstrating strong bipartisan support for the fight against this deadly disease.



  The bill cuts the Administration's request of $520 million for USAID Operating Expenses by $10 million, or two percent. Since much of the Agency's operating costs are fixed, including the cost of replacing USAID's computerized operating system in FY 2001, the proposed cut would force the Agency to delay planned replacement of financial and procurement system, and engage in yet another round of staff reductions.



  Finally, the omission of transfer authority for USAID's Development Credit Program would impede the Agency's ability to mobilize local private capital for development purposes, including microenterprises in the countries in which it works. The proposed 50-percent cut in USAID's credit administrative expenses would likewise impede the Agency's ability to carry out newly implemented credit reforms and effectively oversee its current $14 billion portfolio and would be a further drain on USAID Operating Expenses.


    Inter-American Foundation (IAF). The bill would terminate funding for an agency that has effectively promoted U.S. development interests by fostering self-help poverty reduction programs and democratic practice at the grassroots level in Latin America and the Caribbean. The IAF has successfully addressed its management issues and set in motion a system to vet all grants with American Embassies to prevent any unintended funding of groups with views antithetical to peaceful, market-oriented, democratic development.


    International Organizations and Programs (IO&P). The bill cuts the Administration's request of $357 million by $16 million, or five percent. This would force sizable cuts of nearly 20 percent to unearmarked but important democracy and environmental programs such as the Organization of American States (OAS) Fund for Strengthening Democracy and Montreal Protocol Fund for the Protection of the Ozone Layer. The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for the Global Alliance for Vaccines Initiative (GAVI) (funded in the USAID Global Health account).


    African Development Foundation (ADF). The bill cuts the Administration's request of $16 million by $1.6 million, or 10 percent. While the Administration appreciates the Committee's efforts to support the ADF, the Committee's funding level of $14.4 million falls short of the amount necessary for the ADF to implement new HIV/AIDS prevention strategies in all ADF projects and launch a major program in Nigeria.


    Migration and Refugee Assistance (MRA). The bill cuts the Administration's request of $658 million by $43.2 million, or seven percent. This level would be insufficient to fund anticipated refugee admissions, humanitarian protection and assistance programs, and the administration of these programs at an acceptable level. In particular, this cut would have an adverse impact on the Up to Standards initiative, which is designed to bring refugee assistance programs in Africa up to a life sustaining level, and programs for Palestinian refugees administered by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA). The reduction would also have a severe impact on the refugee admissions program, requiring reductions of 5,000 to 10,000 admissions from the request level. We are also troubled by the congressional notification requirement for all U.S. contributions to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), which could severely jeopardize the health and well-being of refugees and conflict victims by limiting our flexibility to respond to refugee situations in a timely manner.


    Trade and Development Agency (TDA). The bill cuts the Administration's request of $54 million by $8 million, or 15 percent. The Administration believes that the full request would enable TDA to continue its support in developing export opportunities. In recent years, the growing demand worldwide for TDA assistance has stretched its existing resources to conduct its programs effectively.

Foreign Military Financing (FMF). The bill cuts the Administration's request of $3.538 billion by $19 million, or one percent. After taking into account funding levels for vital Middle East programs, the reduction is a 13-percent decrease in funding for the rest of the world. When combined with the Committee's $22 million in earmarks in the bill, this reduction would decrease our ability to strengthen capabilities and vital ties with the militaries of new NATO nations (Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic) and the nations of South-East Europe. This reduction would also jeopardize our support for the Philippines as they engage in efforts to ensure stability in the region, and hamper our efforts to support building the peacekeeping capabilities of African nations where peace is so fragile in so many places.
FY 2000 SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS CONTAINED IN THIS BILL
The Administration opposes the three-bill approach taken by the Senate regarding supplemental funding for critical domestic and foreign policy needs. Our specific concerns with these portions of the supplemental legislation attached to the Military Construction and Foreign Operations bills are described below. We want to work with the Congress to ensure that supplemental funding is enacted quickly and that urgent needs are met.
Kosovo and Southeast Europe
The Administration strongly opposes the lack of funding for any of the requests relating to vital U.S. interests in the Balkan region including: $107 million requested for critical United Nations (UN) peacekeeping operations ($91 million for Kosovo, $16 million for East Timor); $195 million in SEED funds, of which $93 million would contribute to stabilizing Kosovo; and, $285 million for the security and operational needs of Americans carrying out these programs. The $35 million in requested funding for the Foreign Military Financing Program and the International Military Education and Training, both of which were supported by the House supplemental, will enhance our efforts and ability to assist military reform and reorientation in important nations in the Baltic region and southern Europe.
Failure to provide this funding would sabotage U.S. efforts to gain greater burden sharing by our European allies on economic reconstruction, and put at risk the eventual, successful withdrawal of more than 10,000 U.S. troops. SEED programs constitute the major component of our ""exit strategy."" Not to provide these funds would be penny-wise and pound-foolish and would undercut our leverage in the multilateral effort to restore peace and democracy in the region. It would also prevent our efforts to carry out the ongoing stabilization process and endanger hard-won progress that has been made to date. Furthermore, continued delay in providing peacekeeping funds would only cause us to accumulate new arrears to the UN and undercut our efforts to reform the UN and reduce our assessment rates.
Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Debt Forgiveness Initiative
The bill fails to provide any of the fully offset $210 million supplemental that the President has requested for a contribution to the HIPC Trust Fund, which helps to finance multilateral participation in the Initiative. Without a significant U.S. contribution to the Trust Fund in FY 2000, other donors are unlikely to make additional contributions, and countries that would otherwise be eligible for HIPC debt reduction in FY 2000 will not receive it. In particular, the lack of a U.S. contribution is likely to prevent Bolivia and other eligible Latin American countries from receiving HIPC debt treatment. We urge the Senate in the strongest terms to reconsider its decision not to help reform-minded developing countries focus their internal resources on health, education, and other social sector investments that will reduce poverty for millions of the world's poorest people.
Plan Colombia
The Administration commends the Committee's support for the governments of Colombia and other countries in the region in their fight against drug traffickers and would oppose efforts to reduce this funding. However, the Administration has a number of concerns with the Committee's proposed treatment of funding for Plan Colombia.
Plan Colombia is a comprehensive approach to combating drug production in the region and requires the sustained effort delineated in the Administration's proposal. Under that proposal, funding was requested through both Defense and State Department accounts. The Committee splits this comprehensive approach by addressing needs in the Military Construction bill and the Foreign Operations appropriations bill. This bifurcation is not a sensible way to address an integrated plan.
Setting aside that basic issue, the Administration appreciates the Committee's consideration of the funding requests, particularly in the Military Construction bill for the construction of essential Forward Operating Locations in Ecuador, Curacao, and Aruba. However, we have serious concerns with several funding issues and problematic provisions in both the Military Construction bill and the Foreign Operations bill. The problematic provisions in the Foreign Operations bill include the absence of FY 2001 funding, restrictions on Colombia funding, many cumbersome reporting requirements, and the substitution of Huey II for Blackhawk helicopters, which would greatly hinder the implementation of the Plan.
In particular, the Administration strongly opposes the limitations in the Foreign Operations bill on support for Plan Colombia. This provision, which would forbid the use of funds not appropriated in the FY 2001 Military Construction or Foreign Operations appropriations bills from being used to support Plan Colombia, absent a Presidential request and congressional approval, is very onerous. This language could halt all ongoing counter-drug programs, air traffic surveillance activities, routine military training, intelligence collection activities, basic human needs and development work, agricultural development, and U.S. Customs programs linked to the Andean region, including those funded from appropriations already enacted into law. This amendment also places an extremely restrictive cap on the number of personnel who can operate in Colombia, leaving far too little flexibility to carry out essential training, development programs, and Plan Colombia oversight as needed.
The substitution of the 60 Huey II helicopters for the 30 Blackhawk helicopters is also objectionable. The Huey II helicopters are significantly less capable than Blackhawks, with slower speeds, smaller capacity, and less range. In addition, it would take twice as many Huey IIs as Blackhawks to fulfill the same mission, which means twice as many helicopter pilots would need to be trained, and twice the amount of infrastructure, such as hangar space, would be required.
Mozambique Relief and Reconstruction
The Administration has requested $200 million in emergency funding for Mozambique and the region. The Foreign Operations bill provides $25 million, which is utterly inadequate to meet the massive reconstruction needs in Mozambique and other affected countries. We urge the Senate to provide the additional emergency supplemental resources to help Mozambique and the other countries of the region continue their democratic and economic progress.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-administration-policy-s-2522-foreign-operations-export-financing-and-related
Bill Clinton,"July 11, 2000","Statement of Administration Policy: H.R. 4811 - Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Bill, FY 2001","STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY
(House Rules)
(Sponsors: Young (R), FL; Callahan (R), AL)
This Statement of Administration Policy provides the Administration's views on the Foreign Operations, Export Financing and Related Programs Appropriations Bill, FY 2001, as reported by the House Committee. Your consideration of the Administration's views would be appreciated.
The President's FY 2001 Budget is based on a balanced approach that maintains fiscal discipline, eliminates the national debt, extends the solvency of Social Security and Medicare, provides for an appropriately sized tax cut, establishes a new voluntary Medicare prescription drug benefit in the context of broader reforms, expands health care coverage to more families, and funds critical investments for our future. An essential element of this approach is ensuring adequate funding for discretionary programs. To this end, the President has proposed discretionary spending limits at levels that we believe are necessary to serve the American people.
Unfortunately, the FY 2001 congressional budget resolution provides inadequate resources for discretionary investments. We need realistic levels of funding for critical government functions that the American people expect their government to perform well, including education, national security, law enforcement, environmental protection, preservation of our global leadership, air safety, food safety, economic assistance for the less fortunate, research and technology, and the administration of Social Security and Medicare. Based on the inadequate budget resolution, this bill fails to address critical needs of the American people.
Despite the Subcommittee's efforts to provide increases over last year's funding levels for certain programs, the funding provided is inadequate, and many provisions of the Committee bill, such as the international family planning provision, are highly objectionable. The President's senior advisers would recommend that the President veto the bill if it were presented to him in its current form.
Attached is a discussion of the Administration's specific concerns with the bill. We look forward to working with the House to resolve these concerns.

FOREIGN OPERATIONS, EXPORT FINANCING, AND RELATED PROGRAMS APPROPRIATIONS BILL, FY 2001 (As Reported by the House Commmittee)
International Debt Reduction
The House Committee bill would cut the FY 2001 request of $262 million for debt reduction programs by $180 million. This shortfall is greatly exacerbated by the failure of Congress to provide any of the $210 million FY 2000 supplemental request for debt reduction. Full funding of both the FY 2001 and FY 2000 requests is critical. Funding at a low level would stall multilateral and bilateral debt relief efforts under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative. The lack of a substantial U.S. contribution to the HIPC Trust Fund would mean that there would be insufficient resources to provide debt relief to many of the poorest countries in Latin America and Africa that have undertaken macroeconomic reforms. Other bilateral donors have previously stated that they would base their future contributions to the HIPC Trust Fund on a substantial U.S. contribution. It is clear, at a minimum, that without a substantial U.S. contribution, HIPC debt relief would not be provided to Latin American HIPC countries. In addition, funding at this level would also significantly limit the ability of the United States to encourage countries to invest in their tropical forests through innovative debt treatment mechanisms under the Tropical Forest Conservation Act.
International Family Planning
The Committee's actions on the international family planning issue are a great disappointment to the Administration. First, the Committee's decision to maintain the unnecessary restrictions on international family planning providers is highly objectionable. As we have stated before, we should not impose limitations on foreign non-governmental organizations's use of their own money or their ability to participate in the democratic process in their own countries. Second, we strongly oppose the Committee's decision to freeze assistance at the FY 2000 level of $385 million. The requested increase of $156 million over the FY 2000 enacted level, for an FY 2001 funding level of $541 million, would help millions of additional women bear their children at the healthiest times for both mother and baby. The requested increase would also greatly reduce the number of unintended pregnancies, abortions, and deaths of mothers and children. Therefore, we strongly urge the House to drop these restrictions and restore funding to the requested level.
Multilateral Development Banks
Every dollar in U.S. contributions leverages nearly $60 in development assistance from the Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs). The Committee's $536 million, or 40 percent, cut would substantially reduce MDBs lending for education, health, infectious disease prevention, and other social programs in the world's poorest countries. The reduction would also severely undermine our ability to influence new policy directions, such as the fight to bring the HIV/AIDS pandemic under control. Moreover, this cut would nearly double U.S. arrears to over $800 million, reversing the progress made with bipartisan support in the FY 1998 and FY 1999 appropriations towards meeting our past-due obligations to these institutions. Of particular concern are the proposed cuts to the following institutions:

    International Development Association (IDA). IDA is the primary concessional lender for most of the world's neediest countries, with 80 percent of its lending going to countries where people earn less than two dollars a day. The $259 million, or 31 percent, cut in funding made by the Committee would have a devastating impact on IDA's ability to finance priority investments in health, clean water supplies, education, and other infrastructure needed for lasting poverty reduction. Moreover, a low contribution would significantly diminish U.S. leadership as we approach IDA-13 replenishment negotiations early next year.


    Global Environment Facility (GEF). The U.S. commitment to the GEF, begun under President Bush on a bipartisan basis, supports GEF's unique ability to finance environmental projects that cross country borders while promoting sound environmental policy in developing countries. The Committee's $140 million, or 80 percent, cut in funding would severely impair GEF's ability to play a prominent and cost-effective role in areas such as conservation of biodiversity and protection of fisheries. GEF's financial situation is precarious because its commitment authority is expected to run out late this year if financing is not made available. Given that each dollar we provide leverages $10 in co-financing, a low contribution would have a negative and cumulative effect on project work that benefits the global environment. In addition, this low level of funding would undermine U.S. credibility when negotiations for the next replenishment (GEF-3) begin later this year.


    African Development Bank (AfDB). As part of the last capital increase, the AfDB agreed to a series of major institutional reforms designed to strengthen the financial security and corporate governance of the institution. The $3 million, or 49 percent, cut made by the Committee would limit our ability to exercise the leadership necessary to ensure that the bank continues on the path of reform.

Other Concerns. The Committee's cuts to the Asian Development Fund ($53 million), African Development Fund ($28 million), and the Inter-American Investment Corporation ($26 million) would limit the ability of these institutions to provide programs to reduce poverty in countries of critical interest to the United States and would call into question the willingness of other donors to continue their support for these institutions. In addition, the Administration is seriously concerned about the amendment added during the Committee mark-up that links the payment of 10 percent of the U.S. contributions to the international financial institutions to specific and problematic changes in procurement and financial management. Such an amendment would hinder our efforts to reach the international consensus needed to push for such reforms.
Nonproliferation, Anti-terrorism, Demining, and Related Programs
The Committee bill cuts the Administration's request of $352.7 million by $111.1 million, or 32 percent. A reduction of this magnitude cannot be made without jeopardizing programs vital to our nonproliferation and anti-terrorism efforts. In particular, the Committee recommends a cut of $20 million from the $55 million request for the Korean (Peninsula) Energy Development Organization, leaving insufficient funds to purchase necessary shipments of fuel oil, which we are required to provide under the 1995 Agreed Framework. The Committee's recommendation of $25 million for science centers in Russia, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan is $20 million, or 44 percent, below the Administration's request. This massive reduction would result in less support for scientists with expertise in weapons of mass destruction, thus increasing the risk of experts being hired by nations of concern. In addition, the Committee has not responded positively to the Administration's budget amendment that added $41.2 million for a U.S. contribution to the incremental costs of the trial of the suspected Libyan terrorists in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland. The Administration is disappointed that the House Committee has not included requested funding for the Center for Anti-terrorism Security Training. The initiative is an integral part of the Administration's plans to address the growing worldwide terrorist threat.
Eastern Europe
The Administration appreciates the Committee's earlier support for FY 2000 emergency supplemental funds for programs in the Balkans. However, the shortfall from the supplemental request, when combined with the Committee's $75 million reduction to the FY 2001 request for the Assistance to Eastern Europe and the Baltic States account ($610 million to $535 million), would result in a reduction of $220 million, or 27 percent, below the funding needed to establish a stable and durable peace. In addition, the Administration strongly opposes the provision limiting funds available for Kosovo to 15 percent of funds pledged by other donors as of January 1, 2001. This cut-off date would restrict U.S. funding for Kosovo since many donors will not make funding decisions until after that date, thus undercounting other donor pledges. While burdensharing is a key component of our Kosovo policy, the 15-percent cap would arbitrarily make U.S. funding dependent on the decisions of others. The full funding request will support critical programs to revitalize Kosovo's civil society and economy, and reduce the need for prolonged U.S. presence in Kosovo as part of the Kosovo Force.
Assistance to the Independent States
The Committee mark is $96 million below the FY 2000 enacted level of $836 million. The Administration request includes a reduced allocation from FY 2000 for Expanded Threat Reduction Initiative (ETRI) programs, which would allow for restoration of funding for programs designed to foster economic and democratic reforms in the former Soviet Union after they were reduced to make room for ETRI this year. The Committee's reduction to this account would make such a restoration exceedingly difficult. The Administration strongly opposes any prohibition of assistance to the Government of the Russian Federation related to Chechnya and Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) Treaty limit. Denial of funding would seriously undermine our efforts to encourage Russia to honor its CFE Treaty commitments to reduce as soon as possible its military equipment to CFE levels and withdraw its forces from Georgia and Moldova.
U.S. Export-Import Bank
We appreciate the Committee's action to provide adequate program and administrative expense allocations for the Export-Import Bank. Nevertheless, the bill cuts the Administration's request of $963 million for program resources by $138 million, or 14 percent, which would reduce the Export-Import Bank's ability to support U.S. exports by 11 percent ($1.8 billion) from the FY 2000 enacted level and by 14 percent ($2.2 billion) from the President's FY 2001 request. Lower export levels translate directly into lower employment opportunities for U.S. workers and lower revenues for U.S. companies. The requested level is necessary to help the Export-Import Bank pay for the higher cost of international lending caused by higher risk levels resulting from the international financial crisis and represents only a modest increase over the Bank's capacity for FY 2000. The Committee's mark, therefore, represents a de facto reduction in the Bank's capacity to support U.S. exports when compared to the FY 2000 enacted level.
Peacekeeping Operations
The bill cuts the Administration's request of $134 million by $16 million, or 12 percent, which would impair our peacekeeping efforts around the world, requiring cuts to programs such as the U.S. component of the civilian police contingent in East Timor, support to regional peacekeeping initiatives in Africa, and our efforts to train African militaries for peacekeeping operations. Such a reduction could additionally leave us without the means to pay our fair share of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe mission assessment for elections and governance programs directly supporting the peace processes in Bosnia and Kosovo.
Economic Support Fund (ESF)
The bill cuts the Administration's request of $2.3 billion for ESF by $79.1 million, or three percent. When combined with the Middle East and various other earmarks, these reductions would result in a 12-percent cut to other crucial foreign policy programs. Such a cut would have an adverse impact upon regional programs, particularly in Africa, and upon human rights and democracy programs worldwide.
International Organizations and Programs (IO&P)
We are concerned about the $8.5 million reduction to the Administration's request for IO&P. After taking into account funding for UNICEF and the Global Alliance for Vaccines Initiatives, which were requested under this heading but funded under other accounts in the Committee bill, the reduction represents a six-percent reduction in the remaining programs, including important democracy and environmental programs.
Foreign Military Financing (FMF) and International Military Education and Training (IMET)
The Administration appreciates the Committee's positive response to the request for authority to disburse planned Egyptian outlays early in the fiscal year. However, the bill cuts the Administration's request for FMF of $3.5 billion by $28.2 million. After taking into account funding levels for vital Middle East programs, this reduction is a 17-percent decrease in grant funding for the rest of the world. This reduction would decrease our ability to support military reform and NATO inter-operability in the Balkans and South-East Europe, decrease our ability to strengthen capabilities and vital ties with the militaries of new NATO nations (Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic), and hamper our ability to support the Philippines, Tunisia, Morocco, and Mongolia, and build the peacekeeping capabilities of African nations.
The Committee has not accepted the Administration's proposal that the appropriations language requiring obligation upon apportionment for Foreign Military Financing be deleted. The Administration continues to request the deletion of this language. In addition, the Committee bill reduces the funding for administration of FMF programs by $2.5 million from the request and reduces the Administration's request for IMET by $2.5 million, or five percent. These reductions would further hamper these programs, in the face of increasing administrative and training costs.
International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement (INL)
The Committee bill cuts the Administration's request by $7 million and provides the same level of funding as in FY 2000. International crime in the former Soviet Union, Asia, the Caribbean, Latin America, and elsewhere is a serious threat to U.S. interests. This account funds numerous long-term programs in a number of countries. Many of these initiatives are just getting off the ground and are starting to show beneficial results. A cut of $7 million could jeopardize these results in a number of programs now underway and negate the benefits of our initial investment.
U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)
The bill cuts the Administration's request of $2.124 billion for development assistance and health programs by $207 million, or 10 percent. While the Administration notes that the Committee has provided a slight increase over the FY 2000 operating year budget level, the bulk of this increase is for health programs. The FY 2001 level for development assistance is inadequate to meet growing development needs worldwide. The overall reduction from the request in funding is compounded by the number of Committee directives, which would have the effect of further reducing funds available to promote economic growth, protect the environment, and support democracy. For example, at the Committee's funding level, it would be impossible to fully fund the Administration's requests for increased assistance to preserve biodiversity in tropical forests and to promote clean energy technology without cutting deeply into these other activities. The combination of Committee directives and reduced funding levels for development assistance would mean that economic growth activities would be underfunded further, even though the Committee's report states that such activities are necessary if health and family planning programs are to have more than a marginal impact in poor countries.
The bill provides only $23 million of the $65 million increase requested for USAID's HIV/AIDS programs in the Child Survival and Disease Programs Fund. The failure to fund this request fully would set back the Administration's effort to build program momentum that is urgently needed to address the rapid spread of HIV/AIDS in Africa where it has become the leading cause of death, where infection rates often exceed 30 percent of the adult working population, and where it is undermining decades of effort to reduce mortality, improve health, expand educational opportunities, and lift people out of poverty. We urge the Committee to provide the full $244 million requested for HIV/AIDS programs.
The bill reduces the $50 million request for the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations to $37.5 million. This would undermine this public-private partnership's ability to leverage funds from international donors and the private sector to reach millions of children in need of critical vaccines.
The Committee's proposed $15 million (27 percent) cut in funding for the Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) would severely impair the Office's ability to respond to time-sensitive transition situations and stave off crisis -- in places such as Indonesia, Nigeria, Colombia, and Kosovo -- and prevent OTI from helping to lay the foundations for peaceful democracy.
The Committee reduction from the requested $520 million to $509 million for operating expenses would make it more difficult for USAID to implement the much needed improvements in its financial management capabilities and overall information technology -- a goal the Administration and the Committee both share -- and would also make it difficult for the Agency to maintain the staffing level needed to provide adequate program oversight. In addition, the Committee should be aware that House report language accompanying the State Department appropriations bill (H.R. 4690) specifically prohibits the expenditure of $50 million in funds requested by the Administration for buildings to house USAID employees on embassy compounds safely. Safeguarding the lives of USAID employees would thus go unfunded because costs now required could not be absorbed within the President's request for the USAID operating expenses account.
Finally, while the Administration appreciates the Committee's efforts to provide sufficient administrative expenses to run USAID's credit programs, the drastic cut in transfer authority for USAID's Development Credit Program would impede the Agency's ability to mobilize local private capital for development purposes, including microenterprises in the countries in which it works.
Community Adjustment and Investment Program (USCAIP)
The Committee bill provides none of the $10 million requested for the USCAIP. The funds requested are important if the program, which provides financial assistance to U.S. communities with significant job losses due to the implementation of NAFTA, is to become fully productive.
International Technical Assistance Programs
The Committee bill cuts the Administration's request of $7 million by $5 million, or 71 percent. Less than full funding will limit our efforts to provide technical assistance in support of key reform-minded countries around the world.
Kyoto Protocol
The Administration opposes Committee bill language relating to the Kyoto Protocol. The language, which purports to prohibit implementation of the Kyoto Protocol is unnecessary, as the Administration has no intention of implementing the Protocol prior to ratification.
Phalcon Sale to China
The Administration would oppose any amendment that may be offered to condition the disbursement of $250 million in FMF assistance to Israel until the Secretary of Defense certifies to Congress that the proposed transfer by Israel to China of equipment and technology associated with the ""Phalcon"" radar system does not pose a threat to the national security of the United States or has been canceled. We do not view the fencing off of funds in a situation such as this as an effective way to achieve our objectives.
Constitutional Concerns
Several provisions of the Committee bill raise constitutional issues. The Department of Justice has provided views as follows:
Sections 514 (Surplus Commodities), and 564 (Restrictions on Assistance to Countries Providing Sanctuary to Indicted War Criminals) purport to direct the vote of the United States representatives to international financial bodies. As provisions that purport specifically to direct the President on how to proceed in negotiations with international organization could be construed to interfere with the President's exclusive power to control diplomatic negotiations, these provisions would be construed as precatory should they be enacted.


Section 565 (To Prohibit Foreign Assistance to the Government of the Russian Federation Should It Enact Laws Which Would Discriminate Against Minority Religious Faiths in the Russian Federation) and the section entitled ""Contribution to the International Development Association,"" could be read to infringe upon the President's authority over diplomatic negotiations. These provisions, if enacted, would also be construed as precatory.


Finally, in order to avoid intrusion into the President's negotiation power and his ability to maintain the confidentiality of diplomatic negotiations, section 566 (Greenhouse Gas Emissions) would not be interpreted to require the President to disclose either the contents of diplomatic communications or specific plans for particular negotiations in the future.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-administration-policy-hr-4811-foreign-operations-export-financing-and-related

FOREIGN OPERATIONS, EXPORT FINANCING, AND RELATED PROGRAMS APPROPRIATIONS BILL, FY 2001 (As Reported by the House Committee)
International Debt Reduction
The House Committee bill would cut the FY 2001 request of $262 million for debt reduction programs by $180 million. This shortfall is greatly exacerbated by the failure of Congress to provide any of the $210 million FY 2000 supplemental request for debt reduction.

The requested increase of $156 million over the FY 2000 enacted level, for an FY 2001 funding level of $541 million, would help millions of additional women bear their children at the healthiest times for both mother and baby. The requested increase would also greatly reduce the number of unintended pregnancies, abortions, and deaths of mothers and children. Therefore, we strongly urge the House to drop these restrictions and restore funding to the requested level.
Multilateral Development Banks
Every dollar in U.S. contributions leverages nearly $60 in development assistance from the Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs). The Committee's $536 million, or 40 percent, cut would substantially reduce MDBs lending for education, health, infectious disease prevention, and other social programs in the world's poorest countries. The reduction would also severely undermine our ability to influence new policy directions, such as the fight to bring the HIV/AIDS pandemic under control. Moreover, this cut would nearly double U.S. arrears to over $800 million, reversing the progress made with bipartisan support in the FY 1998 and FY 1999 appropriations towards meeting our past-due obligations to these institutions. Of particular concern are the proposed cuts to the following institutions:

    International Development Association (IDA). IDA is the primary concessional lender for most of the world's neediest countries, with 80 percent of its lending going to countries where people earn less than two dollars a day. The $259 million, or 31 percent, cut in funding made by the Committee would have a devastating impact on IDA's ability to finance priority investments in health, clean water supplies, education, and other infrastructure needed for lasting poverty reduction. Moreover, a low contribution would significantly diminish U.S. leadership as we approach IDA-13 replenishment negotiations early next year.


    Global Environment Facility (GEF). The U.S. commitment to the GEF, begun under President Bush on a bipartisan basis, supports GEF's unique ability to finance environmental projects that cross country borders while promoting sound environmental policy in developing countries. The Committee's $140 million, or 80 percent, cut in funding would severely impair GEF's ability to play a prominent and cost-effective role in areas such as conservation of biodiversity and protection of fisheries. GEF's financial situation is precarious because its commitment authority is expected to run out late this year if financing is not made available. Given that each dollar we provide leverages $10 in co-financing, a low contribution would have a negative and cumulative effect on project work that benefits the global environment. In addition, this low level of funding would undermine U.S. credibility when negotiations for the next replenishment (GEF-3) begin later this year.


    African Development Bank (AfDB). As part of the last capital increase, the AfDB agreed to a series of major institutional reforms designed to strengthen the financial security and corporate governance of the institution. The $3 million, or 49 percent, cut made by the Committee would limit our ability to exercise the leadership necessary to ensure that the bank continues on the path of reform.

Other Concerns. The Committee's cuts to the Asian Development Fund ($53 million), African Development Fund ($28 million), and the Inter-American Investment Corporation ($26 million) would limit the ability of these institutions to provide programs to reduce poverty in countries of critical interest to the United States and would call into question the willingness of other donors to continue their support for these institutions. In addition, the Administration is seriously concerned about the amendment added during the Committee mark-up that links the payment of 10 percent of the U.S. contributions to the international financial institutions to specific and problematic changes in procurement and financial management. Such an amendment would hinder our efforts to reach the international consensus needed to push for such reforms.
Nonproliferation, Anti-terrorism, Demining, and Related Programs
The Committee bill cuts the Administration's request of $352.7 million by $111.1 million, or 32 percent. A reduction of this magnitude cannot be made without jeopardizing programs vital to our nonproliferation and anti-terrorism efforts. In particular, the Committee recommends a cut of $20 million from the $55 million request for the Korean (Peninsula) Energy Development Organization, leaving insufficient funds to purchase necessary shipments of fuel oil, which we are required to provide under the 1995 Agreed Framework. The Committee's recommendation of $25 million for science centers in Russia, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan is $20 million, or 44 percent, below the Administration's request. This massive reduction would result in less support for scientists with expertise in weapons of mass destruction, thus increasing the risk of experts being hired by nations of concern. In addition, the Committee has not responded positively to the Administration's budget amendment that added $41.2 million for a U.S. contribution to the incremental costs of the trial of the suspected Libyan terrorists in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland. The Administration is disappointed that the House Committee has not included requested funding for the Center for Anti-terrorism Security Training. The initiative is an integral part of the Administration's plans to address the growing worldwide terrorist threat.
Eastern Europe
The Administration appreciates the Committee's earlier support for FY 2000 emergency supplemental funds for programs in the Balkans. However, the shortfall from the supplemental request, when combined with the Committee's $75 million reduction to the FY 2001 request for the Assistance to Eastern Europe and the Baltic States account ($610 million to $535 million), would result in a reduction of $220 million, or 27 percent, below the funding needed to establish a stable and durable peace. In addition, the Administration opposes the provision limiting funds available for Kosovo to 15 percent of funds pledged by other donors as of January 1, 2001. This cut-off date would restrict U.S. funding for Kosovo since many donors will not make funding decisions until after that date, thus undercounting other donor pledges. While burdensharing is a key component of our Kosovo policy, the 15-percent cap would arbitrarily make U.S. funding dependent on the decisions of others. The full funding request will support critical programs to revitalize Kosovo's civil society and economy, and reduce the need for prolonged U.S. presence in Kosovo as part of the Kosovo Force.
Assistance to the Independent States
The Committee mark is $96 million below the FY 2000 enacted level of $836 million. The Administration strongly opposes the Committee's decision to cut funding for critically important programs to foster economic and democratic reforms in the former Soviet Union. These carefully targeted programs work with reform-minded governments and help foster grass roots support for reforms by working with small businesses and non-governmental organizations. These programs are helping citizens of the region make the transition to market democracies -- a transition clearly in our long-term national security interests. We also strongly object to cuts in the request for Expanded Threat Reduction Initiative (ETRI) programs. The Administration's ETRI request will advance important nonproliferation objectives in the former Soviet Union. A cut in this request will undermine our ability to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and the illicit trafficking in WMD and missile related technologies. The Administration strongly opposes any prohibition of assistance to the Government of the Russian Federation in response to Chechnya and Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) Treaty limit. Denial of funding would seriously undermine our efforts to work with the Russian Government to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, to engage Russian scientists who would otherwise work on projects in countries of proliferation concern, and to honor its CFE Treaty-related commitments to withdraw its forces from Georgia and Moldova.
U.S. Export-Import Bank
We appreciate the Committee's action to provide adequate program and administrative expense allocations for the Export-Import Bank. Nevertheless, the bill cuts the Administration's request of $963 million for program resources by $138 million, or 14 percent, which would reduce the Export-Import Bank's ability to support U.S. exports by 11 percent ($1.8 billion) from the FY 2000 enacted level and by 14 percent ($2.2 billion) from the President's FY 2001 request. Lower export levels translate directly into lower employment opportunities for U.S. workers and lower revenues for U.S. companies. The requested level is necessary to help the Export-Import Bank pay for the higher cost of international lending caused by higher risk levels resulting from the international financial crisis and represents only a modest increase over the Bank's capacity for FY 2000. The Committee's mark, therefore, represents a de facto reduction in the Bank's capacity to support U.S. exports when compared to the FY 2000 enacted level.
Peacekeeping Operations
The bill cuts the Administration's request of $134 million by $16 million, or 12 percent, which would impair our peacekeeping efforts around the world, requiring cuts to programs such as the U.S. component of the civilian police contingent in East Timor, support to regional peacekeeping initiatives in Africa, and our efforts to train African militaries for peacekeeping operations. Such a reduction could additionally leave us without the means to pay our fair share of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe mission assessment for elections and governance programs directly supporting the peace processes in Bosnia and Kosovo.
Economic Support Fund (ESF)
The bill cuts the Administration's request of $2.3 billion for ESF by $79.1 million, or three percent. When combined with the Middle East and various other earmarks, these reductions would result in a 12-percent cut to other crucial foreign policy programs. Such a cut would have an adverse impact upon regional programs, particularly in Africa, and upon human rights and democracy programs worldwide.
International Organizations and Programs (IO&P)
We are concerned about the $8.5 million reduction to the Administration's request for IO&P. After taking into account funding for UNICEF and the Global Alliance for Vaccines Initiatives, which were requested under this heading but funded under other accounts in the Committee bill, the reduction represents a six-percent reduction in the remaining programs, including important democracy and environmental programs.
Foreign Military Financing (FMF) and International Military Education and Training (IMET)
The Administration appreciates the Committee's positive response to the request for authority to disburse planned Egyptian outlays early in the fiscal year. However, the bill cuts the Administration's request for FMF of $3.5 billion by $28.2 million. After taking into account funding levels for vital Middle East programs, this reduction is a 17-percent decrease in grant funding for the rest of the world. This reduction would decrease our ability to support military reform and NATO inter-operability in the Balkans and South-East Europe, decrease our ability to strengthen capabilities and vital ties with the militaries of new NATO nations (Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic), and hamper our ability to support the Philippines, Tunisia, Morocco, and Mongolia, and build the peacekeeping capabilities of African nations.
The Committee has not accepted the Administration's proposal that the appropriations language requiring obligation upon apportionment for Foreign Military Financing be deleted. The Administration continues to request the deletion of this language. In addition, the Committee bill reduces the funding for administration of FMF programs by $2.5 million from the request and reduces the Administration's request for IMET by $2.5 million, or five percent. These reductions would further hamper these programs, in the face of increasing administrative and training costs.
International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement (INL)
The Committee bill cuts the Administration's request by $7 million and provides the same level of funding as in FY 2000. International crime in the former Soviet Union, Asia, the Caribbean, Latin America, and elsewhere is a serious threat to U.S. interests. This account funds numerous long-term programs in a number of countries. Many of these initiatives are just getting off the ground and are starting to show beneficial results. A cut of $7 million could jeopardize these results in a number of programs now underway and negate the benefits of our initial investment.
U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)
The bill cuts the Administration's request of $2.124 billion for development assistance and health programs by $207 million, or 10 percent. While the Administration notes that the Committee has provided a slight increase over the FY 2000 operating year budget level, the bulk of this increase is for health programs. The FY 2001 level for development assistance is inadequate to meet growing development needs worldwide. The overall reduction from the request in funding is compounded by the number of Committee directives, which would have the effect of further reducing funds available to promote economic growth, protect the environment, and support democracy. For example, at the Committee's funding level, it would be impossible to fully fund the Administration's requests for increased assistance to preserve biodiversity in tropical forests and to promote clean energy technology without cutting deeply into these other activities. The combination of Committee directives and reduced funding levels for development assistance would mean that economic growth activities would be underfunded further, even though the Committee's report states that such activities are necessary if health and family planning programs are to have more than a marginal impact in poor countries.
The bill provides only $23 million of the $65 million increase requested for USAID's HIV/AIDS programs in the Child Survival and Disease Programs Fund. The failure to fund this request fully would set back the Administration's effort to build program momentum that is urgently needed to address the rapid spread of HIV/AIDS in Africa where it has become the leading cause of death, where infection rates often exceed 30 percent of the adult working population, and where it is undermining decades of effort to reduce mortality, improve health, expand educational opportunities, and lift people out of poverty. We urge the Committee to provide the full $244 million requested for HIV/AIDS programs.
The bill reduces the $50 million request for the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations to $37.5 million. This would undermine this public-private partnership's ability to leverage funds from international donors and the private sector to reach millions of children in need of critical vaccines.
The Committee's proposed $15 million (27 percent) cut in funding for the Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) would severely impair the Office's ability to respond to time-sensitive transition situations and stave off crisis -- in places such as Indonesia, Nigeria, Colombia, and Kosovo -- and prevent OTI from helping to lay the foundations for peaceful democracy.
The Committee reduction from the requested $520 million to $509 million for operating expenses would make it more difficult for USAID to implement the much needed improvements in its financial management capabilities and overall information technology -- a goal the Administration and the Committee both share -- and would also make it difficult for the Agency to maintain the staffing level needed to provide adequate program oversight. In addition, the Committee should be aware that House report language accompanying the State Department appropriations bill (H.R. 4690) specifically prohibits the expenditure of $50 million in funds requested by the Administration for buildings to house USAID employees on embassy compounds safely. Safeguarding the lives of USAID employees would thus go unfunded because costs now required could not be absorbed within the President's request for the USAID operating expenses account.
Finally, while the Administration appreciates the Committee's efforts to provide sufficient administrative expenses to run USAID's credit programs, the drastic cut in transfer authority for USAID's Development Credit Program would impede the Agency's ability to mobilize local private capital for development purposes, including microenterprises in the countries in which it works.
Community Adjustment and Investment Program (USCAIP)
The Committee bill provides none of the $10 million requested for the USCAIP. The funds requested are important if the program, which provides financial assistance to U.S. communities with significant job losses due to the implementation of NAFTA, is to become fully productive.
International Technical Assistance Programs
The Committee bill cuts the Administration's request of $7 million by $5 million, or 71 percent. Less than full funding will limit our efforts to provide technical assistance in support of key reform-minded countries around the world.
Kyoto Protocol
The Administration opposes Committee bill language relating to the Kyoto Protocol. The language, which purports to prohibit implementation of the Kyoto Protocol, is unnecessary, as the Administration has no intention of implementing the Protocol prior to ratification.
Phalcon Sale to China
The Administration would oppose any amendment that may be offered to condition the disbursement of $250 million in FMF assistance to Israel until the Secretary of Defense certifies to Congress that the proposed transfer by Israel to China of equipment and technology associated with the ""Phalcon"" radar system does not pose a threat to the national security of the United States or has been canceled. We do not view the fencing off of funds in a situation such as this as an effective way to achieve our objectives.
Constitutional Concerns
Several provisions of the Committee bill raise constitutional issues. The Department of Justice has provided views as follows:
Sections 514 (Surplus Commodities), and 564 (Restrictions on Assistance to Countries Providing Sanctuary to Indicted War Criminals) purport to direct the vote of the United States representatives to international financial bodies. As provisions that purport specifically to direct the President on how to proceed in negotiations with international organization could be construed to interfere with the President's exclusive power to control diplomatic negotiations, these provisions would be construed as precatory should they be enacted.


Section 565 (To Prohibit Foreign Assistance to the Government of the Russian Federation Should It Enact Laws Which Would Discriminate Against Minority Religious Faiths in the Russian Federation) and the section entitled ""Contribution to the International Development Association,"" could be read to infringe upon the President's authority over diplomatic negotiations. These provisions, if enacted, would also be construed as precatory.


Finally, in order to avoid intrusion into the President's negotiation power and his ability to maintain the confidentiality of diplomatic negotiations, section 566 (Greenhouse Gas Emissions) would not be interpreted to require the President to disclose either the contents of diplomatic communications or specific plans for particular negotiations in the future.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-administration-policy-hr-4811-foreign-operations-export-financing-and-related-0
Bill Clinton,"July 17, 2000","Press Briefing by Lael Brainard, Deputy National Economic Advisor and Jim Steinberg, Deputy National Security Advisor","The James S. Brady Briefing Room
12:50 P.M. EDT
MR. STOCKWELL: Good afternoon. Today's press briefing is on President Clinton's upcoming trip to Japan. The briefers are Jim Steinberg, Deputy National Security Advisor; and Lael Brainard, Deputy National Economic Advisor. First up is Lael.
MS. BRAINARD: The President is departing Wednesday for his 8th G-7/G-8 meeting. And before I go into the schedule I'll give you a brief overview of how the G-8 has evolved during the President's tenure, and a description of our overall agenda for Okinawa.
During the time that the President has been attending the G-7/G-8 meetings, the G-7 has expanded to formally include Russia, with the first official summit of the 8 hosted actually by President Clinton in Denver in 1997. And the agenda has expanded beyond issues of macroeconomic coordination to include the full range of issues critical to world prosperity and world stability.
Jim will comment on the regional security aspects of the Okinawa agenda in a moment, and will also preview the bilaterals.
Events have come full circle. The President attended his first summit in Japan in 1993, and will be attending this, his last summit, again in Japan. In 1993, the President was the new guy on the block with a weak U.S. economy and growing deficits. This year he returns as the senior statesman in the group, with a positive world economic outlook, the longest expansion in U.S. history, and an established record on turning deficits into surpluses.
It's worth noting that since between 1980 and 1993, every G-7 communique noted concerns about the U.S. budget deficit. In 1993, for the first time the deficit reduction plan was commended. And this year, of course, our deficit, which was projected to be $455 billion in 2000, is now, in fact, projected to be a surplus of $211 billion.
The other thing that's worth noting on the economic front is the information technology revolution that has helped drive economic growth in the United States has drawn attention throughout the world and will, in fact, be chief theme of the summit.
But at the same time there is heightened prosperity in parts of the world, there is growing disparity with the poorest nations. One point two billion of the world's roughly 6 billion people live on less than $1 per day. Another 1.6 billion live on less than $2 a day. So a second chief theme of the Okinawa Summit is to address the health divide, the education divide and the digital divide with a renewed sense of urgency and purpose.
For the first time ever, on the eve of the Summit, G-8 leaders will meet with leaders of developing nations, representatives of the private sector and key multilateral development organizations to develop a deeper partnership on global poverty.
The G-8 will signal their intent to work with these actors on a coordinated response to support strong efforts by leaders of the developing world who want to move forward on these critical challenges. This builds on one of the Cologne summit's primary achievements, which was a plan to triple the scale of debt relief for the world's poorest. Together, Cologne and Okinawa are critical steps in the President's personal agenda of putting a human face on the global economy.
Trade investment and technology are potential powerful engines of growth and development for poor countries, but they are necessary, not sufficient. That is why Okinawa is going to look at some of the complementary policies that are so important. For instance, lack of human capacity associated with disease, malnutrition and illiteracy make it impossible for some of the developing countries to take advantage of these opportunities. Sick and malnourished people have less access to education, find it harder to learn; illiterate people are harder to reach through public health campaigns -- targeted HIV-AIDS -- and it's harder for them to implement complicated treatment regimes.
Let me give you a few of the statistics on HIV-AIDS and infectious diseases more generally. HIV-AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria threaten an entire generation of the developing world. They're taking a devastating human and economic toll. And because they're disproportionately afflicting those with the least ability to afford immunizations and treatments, the private sector does not have an incentive to invest in these critical areas that's consistent with the social value of doing so.
That's why a coordinated response is necessary. In Botswana, Zimbabwe, and South Africa, over 20 percent of the population is infected, and half of all 15-year-olds are projected to die of AIDS. The population of each of these countries will actually decline in the coming years. And 44 million children will be orphaned worldwide in the next decade as a result of HIV-AIDS.
Tuberculosis accounts for more than 2.3 million deaths each year, and malaria kills more than 1 million, mostly in Africa. And finally, at least 3 million children die needlessly each year for lack of access to existing vaccines.
The G-8 will come up with a response on some of these challenges. Secondly, Okinawa will seek to address the education divide. Universal basic education is a critical goal, both in its own right and because it is a critical tool for fighting disease and for taking advantage of economic opportunity. Extensive research suggests this is one of the highest returning investments in the world.
Let me give you another statistic in this area. About 60-70 percent of the estimated over 100 million children who are not in school are girls; 40 percent of African children are out of school; 26 percent of South and West Asian children are out of school. At the G-8 the leaders will be talking about the principles and commitments that were made at Dakar to achieve universal education -- universal primary education -- by 2015, and also the Dakar principle that no country that comes forward with a strong education for all plan should not be able to implement it for lack of resources.
Finally, let me talk briefly about the digital divide. The G-8 leaders will be discussing with the developing country heads of state and members of the private sector how to create digital opportunity for the people of the developing world.
Information technology holds great promise, not only for economic opportunity, but also for improving access to health care and to education in poor and remote areas. It's worth noting that of the estimated 332 million people on line, less than 1 percent live in Africa. That's about 2.7, 2.8 out of 700 million people. Less than 5 percent of the computers connected to the Internet are in developing countries.
This is something where the President's experience in the domestic context, on closing the domestic digital divide will be helpful as we think about how to address the even more challenging problem of the global digital divide. He also will be harking back to his experiences in India, where he observed a new mother getting information about how to care for her baby on the Internet in a local community access site, where he observed people getting their drivers licenses off the Internet in Hyderabad, and also some of the world's leading entrepreneurs functioning in India in a developing economy.
This is an area where the administration has a long history. In fact, the Vice President called for a global information infrastructure in a speech that he gave in Buenos Aires as far back as 1994. The G-8 leaders will be releasing an Okinawa Charter on the global information society, which we hope will commit to mobilize and coordinate both public and private sector efforts to bridge the divide. And we have been working with private sectors and foundations to support it.
That is the economic part of the agenda and, again, Jim will go over the security and regional issues. Let me speak briefly about the schedule, before handing over to him.
We arrive into Tokyo early in the afternoon on Thursday, where the President will proceed to the Akasaka State Guest House for a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Mori. From there, they will go into the first-ever meeting with developing nations, in particular, with leaders from -- Mbeki, from South Africa; Obasango, from Nigeria; Chuan, from Thailand; and Bouteflika, from Algeria -- representing organizations such as the G-7/E-7, NAM, OAU and the ASEANs.
From that meeting they will they go into an expanded session to talk about the development partnership for the 21st century, including representatives of several multilateral institutions, as well as private sector representatives. I don't have a complete list at the moment of the participants, but we do know that Gro Brundtland of the WHO will be there, Mark Malloch Brown of UNDP, Jim Wolfensohn of the World Bank; and several members of the private sector, including John Chambers of CISCO, here in the United States, Vernon Ellis of Andersen International, Idei of Sony and several others.
From there the President travels on to Okinawa. In the morning he will tour and give remarks at the Cornerstone of Peace Park, which is a memorial to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II and, in particular, the Battle of Okinawa. It's situated on the cliffs above the island's southernmost shore and is the location of the last fighting of a very fierce battle, which I think Jim will give you some more detail on. The names of all of those who lost their lives in the Battle of Okinawa, including those from Japan, Okinawa and the United States are engraved on the granite walls in the park.
He will go from there to the beginning of the G-7, G-8 with a G-7 session at the Conference Hall of the Bankoku Shinryokan Conference Center. That is a new conference center that was constructed precisely for this purpose. I believe the name of the convention center means ""bridging the nations."" And it includes, I believe, a bronze bell cast in 1458 by the Ryukyku King which says that the Ryukyku Kingdom -- which is Okinawa -- shall become the bridge between nations. As you know, Prime Minister Obuchi wanted the summit held here because of the importance of Okinawa.
Then, from there, he'll go into a bilateral meeting with President Putin of Russia. And from there to the G-8, the first formal session of the G-8, the working dinner, which, again, will be held at the Conference Center.
On Saturday there is basically a working session of the G-8 all day, at the Conference Center. And then in the evening dinner will be held, a social dinner will be held at Shuri Castle. Shuri Castle is the previous political and administrative center of the Ryukyku Kingdom. It was destroyed during the war and has subsequently been rebuilt and has an example of traditional Okinawan architecture.
We conclude on Sunday with a G-8 session in the morning and the adoption of the communique. I believe there is a bilateral with Prime Minister Blair of the UK. There is a farewell ceremony; I think it will be a cultural dance that includes 150 Okinawan children. And then the President will visit Camp Foster, which is a Marine base on Okinawa. And, again, Jim will give you greater detail on that.
Thank you.
MR. STEINBERG: Thank you, Lael. I think this is a first in briefing room experience, of the sherpa and the ex-sherpa briefing on the upcoming events.
Let me say a word about the security and foreign policy part of the agenda for the G-8 meeting, and then I'll talk a little bit about both the Okinawa/Japan bilaterals and the other meetings that the President will have during the trip.
As veteran G-8 watchers know, the first dinner Friday night is dedicated to the foreign policy issues. And as often happened in the past, the sort of event of the day is the normal fare on the menu. We've had issues in the past involving Bosnia and the Indian nuclear test and such.
This year there is no one single issue that I think is going to dominate the agenda, unless we have some dramatic events between now and Friday. But it does give the leaders an opportunity to discuss a broader range of national security related issues. In particular, I think this year there will continue to be a focus on nonproliferation and particularly an effort to get G-8 support for the recently concluded bilateral agreement between the United States and Russia on plutonium disposition.
That agreement, which was reached when the President was in Moscow, is backed up by Congress having already $200 million here in the United States and we're seeking a similar amount in the year to come. But we need support from the other G-8 countries -- Japan, in particular, has been supportive in the past and we look forward to support from others.
Similarly, in the area of Russia's WMD stocks, we would like to see some further progress in the G-8 countries helping Russia deal with the problem and the expenses associated with Russia's destruction of its chemical weapons stocks. And this is another opportunity for the G-8 to work together towards that end.
A second feature on the national security side which will be a subject of discussion is in the area of conflict prevention. Under the efforts of the foreign ministers over the last year, there has been an effort to deal with some of the kind of more persistent problems that fuel conflicts around the world -- including small arms sales that fuel conflicts, the need to develop a framework to allow the international financial institutions to be effective and work in post-conflict situations, focus particularly in the last six months to a year on the problem of conflict diamonds, and the need to develop an effective regime to prevent these from being a source of funding for rebel forces.
And finally, a growing interest in the need to enhance the international community's capacity to provide civilian police in post-conflict situations. It's a problem we've seen in many of the peacekeeping operations that the United States has been involved in, from Haiti to Bosnia to Kosovo, and the difficulty of getting counterparts to our military peacekeepers to deal with the problem of creating stability and security in these post-conflict environments.
Finally, on the security agenda there will be a discussion on terrorism, particularly strengthening the U.N. conventions on terrorism and on funding and financial support for terrorists.
In addition to these sort of functional issues, the leaders will touch on a number of most important regional security problems, including a broad-ranging discussion on the Balkans, the conflicts now underway and the U.N. efforts to cope with them in Africa. I'm sure the President will be in a position to give them an update on his efforts over the last week in Camp David on the Middle East peace process; further discussions on the efforts to bring stability to South Asia and to move down the path away from nuclear and missile spread there; and, undoubtedly, some discussion of recent developments in North Korea, which a number of the countries in the G-8 have considerable interest.
Turning now to the bilateral piece of the President's trip, this will be the President's third opportunity to meet with Prime Minister Mori in a relatively short space of time. In addition to the meeting here, the President had a bilateral meeting with the Prime Minister when he went to Japan for the memorial service in honor of the late Prime Minister Obuchi, and it's a real reflection of the continued importance that the United States attaches to the U.S.-Japan relationship and the efforts that both countries have made over the last eight years to transform the relationship to reflect the new realities and the new possibilities of the post-Cold War in East Asia.
This is a relationship that is multifaceted, and in addition to discussing security issues, they will -- security issues like Korea and the Middle East peace process, where Japan has been a very important financial contributor to efforts in that region -- we will discuss broad-ranging global issues under the framework of our common agenda, and a number of outstanding economic and trade issues.
As Lael mentioned, one of the distinctive features of the summit from the Japanese point of view was the decision to hold this summit in Okinawa, and this provides President Clinton and the whole delegation an opportunity to really reflect on the value that we attach to both Japan generally, and the people of Okinawa to supporting our presence there. And the visit of the President to the Peace Park, where he will talk before a group of community leaders and representatives of the community, will be an opportunity for him to address directly to the Okinawan people the importance that we attach to the relationship and the importance that we attach to developing strong human ties as possible -- the goal of trying to have a good neighborly relationship with the people in Okinawa.
As Lael also said, the President will have two bilateral meetings in the time that he is in Okinawa. The first will be with Prime Minister Putin. This will build on the meetings that the President had while he was in Moscow just a few months ago. This, again, will be a wide-ranging opportunity for the President to -- and the new President of Russia, President Putin, to discuss the full range of their issues, not only on issues of arms control, strategic stability and threat reduction, but also the economic issues, regional security issues. And the President, I'm confident, will have an opportunity to raise some of the concerns that he has on issues such as press freedom, the rule of law, and Chechnya.
The second bilateral will be with Prime Minister Blair. This, again, will be a wide-ranging agenda where I expect that they will touch on Russia, the Balkans, the Middle East peace process, the progress that we've made in Northern Ireland and our joint efforts in particular to try to bring stability and peace to Sierra Leone.
So with that, let me stop and bring Lael back up and take your questions.
Q: Jim, how significant do you expect national missile defense to be an issue with the Prime Minister in view of the failure of the test? And the foreign ministers last week said that they stress the importance of maintaining the ABM treaty. Do you read that as a criticism of NMD?
MR. STEINBERG: On the second, definitely not. I think one of the hallmarks of our approach to the whole question of national missile defense is precisely that we are convinced that it is important to maintain the ABM treaty as a cornerstone of strategic stability. But the treaty, by its own terms, always contemplated the need to update it to deal with changes in the strategic environment.
And our argument, to the Russians and others, is to look at the emerging threats, threats which the Russians themselves have acknowledged in the joint statement that President Putin and President Clinton issued in Moscow, and see that by making modest changes in the ABM treaty we can address those emerging threats, at the same time preserve the core importance of the ABM treaty -- in contrast to other proposals for NMD, which would put the ABM treaty very much in jeopardy. So we welcome that call by the foreign ministers.
I think that -- I'm sure there will be discussion of NMD. It's an important topic. The President, I'm sure, will want to take advantage of having the leaders there to discuss the issues that are facing him and the decision that he will be making in the coming weeks. I think that he will indicate that he is going to take into account the concerns that have been addressed and all of the factors that we've previously identified, the four basic variables of cost, threat, technical feasibility and the impact on overall security, and continue an important dialogue that he has had both individually and collectively with the leaders over the last year or so.
Q: Will he still say that he intends to make that decision? Some Democratic leaders are urging him not -- to let that go to his successor.
MR. STEINBERG: Well, there is a little bit of a semantic thing. He will make a decision whether to begin deployment next year. Whether he decides to do that or not is obviously of the options that available to him. But he will make a decision as to whether to go forward at this time or not.
Q: How do you think the President is going to -- alleged crime by the serviceman stationed in Okinawa? Is he going to talk about it in the bilateral meeting with the President, or is he going to talk directly to the people at Okinawa when he makes remarks?
MR. STEINBERG: Well, as I think you know, both our Ambassador to Japan and the senior military commander have directly addressed that case. And I think that, more generally, the President is going to talk about the importance that we attach to good neighborly relations with the people of Okinawa, the responsibility that we feel to make sure that we do everything possible to make that a positive arrangement. And to do what we need to do to make sure that the safety of the people, of the Okinawans are assured.
So I think in general terms he will address precisely his sense of responsibility and gratitude to the people of Okinawa for doing what they've done as part of our shared interest in providing stability for the region. Because our presence in Japan is not simply for the benefit of the United States, but as I think the Japanese Government understands very clearly, and has expressed very clearly, that this is something that benefits all the people of the region. So we want to find a way together to address the concerns that the community has; to have a good dialogue with the community about those things, but to understand that we need to have a good strong shared basis for our continued presence there.
Q: What do you think is the impact of those incidents over the President's visit to Japan this time around, especially in Okinawa?
MR. STEINBERG: Without commenting on any specifics, let me just say that any time an incident arises it's regrettable and we do everything that we can to try to remove the causes of that. We want to have a relationship where there are never any incidents of that type. But the most important thing is to have a good dialogue, to have an understanding with the community leaders so that if there are other steps that they feel are useful to take that we can have those kinds of discussions. And I think that part of the exercise that all of the services in Okinawa are now undergoing is precisely to review our practices -- Secretary Cohen has asked for a review to see whether there are other steps that need to be taken. And we take this very seriously.
Q: Will the President support efforts by some europeans -- and Germany, in particular -- to get a clause in the final communique warning Milosovic to -- hands off Montenegro? And is this something of a test for Putin, where he stands on this? How he comes down on the whole question of the Balkans?
MR. STEINBERG: Well, as I think you know, this was a subject of discussion by the foreign ministers at their meeting in anticipation of the leaders' meeting. And I think that many of the G-8 countries, particularly our NATO allies and ourselves are concerned about efforts by Milosovic to destabilize the region, not only in Montenegro, but more broadly. And so, as I said, I expect both in the dinner meeting and in the bilateral with President Putin that the issue of stability in the Balkans will come up and the President will stress the importance that we attach to maintaining the democratic government under Mr. Djukanovic.
How that will be handled in the communique I think is always a little bit unpredictable. One of the lessons that I've learned from my experience being there is that the discussions, particularly at the evening dinner, are ones in which the leaders themselves like to kind of take charge of and decide how they want to handle it in terms of their public expression. So it's a little hard for me to anticipate that. But I'm quite sure that the issue specifically of the risks of actions in Montenegro, and more generally about the concerns that we have about Milosevic's continued destabilizing presence and the need to move on to a real democratic government in Serbia is going to be a matter of discussion.
Q: And what about the read on Putin's position on this? Is this going to be considered a test of his ""are you with us or against us"" sort of thing?
MR. STEINBERG: I think the argument that the President has made to President Putin -- and they discussed this when the President was in Moscow -- is that it is in our common interest to have a stable Balkans, and that as long as Milosevic is there we will have instability. And so I think that what we will continue to impress on the Russians is the fact that we have a common interest in seeing that kind of change there. You look at the changes that are taking place throughout the region -- the installation of a truly democratic government in Croatia, the positive impact that that's having, some of the changes that are taking place in the political landscape in Bosnia -- and that Serbia remains the most important source of instability.
So it's not simply a test for Putin, but it's the Russians' understanding that it really is in their interest, as it is for all the countries of Europe, to solve this problem and to have a solution which brings greater stability.
Q: The President said in his interview with the New York Daily News about going to Japan -- he said that he hopes he will be able to go and that he will give it his best shot. This doesn't seem like a real strong determination that he will go or that he has all intention of going. Do you get a growing sense that the President may miss a day or the entire G-8 summit because of the Middle East peace talks?
MR. STEINBERG: I think Joe spoke to that earlier this morning, and I think that I can't really improve on what he's had to say, so I'll leave it there.
Q: Do you expect the President to speak to the other countries present about their financial support for U.N. peacekeeping missions, and possibly for financial support towards any settlement that might come out of the Mideast peace talks?
MR. STEINBERG: We certainly -- the issue of funding for the U.N. and for peacekeeping missions has been a common topic. As you can tell from the agenda that I've described, they're going to -- it's going to be hard to get all of these things in. But I think, particularly in the context of African peacekeeping, that there may well be some discussion about how to mobilize the resources that we need to have. It's certainly something that we feel very strongly about and are very concerned by some of the appropriations bills now pending before Congress, which do not fully fund our obligations under peacekeeping. And I think the President will make clear that we take that very seriously and are going to judge those appropriations bills in part by how they do on that.
I think that, more broadly on the peace process, it's just premature to say where we'll be at that process. But I would simply note that both the EU and Japan have in the past been generous contributors to aspects of the peace process in the Middle East and we would certainly very much hope and expect that they would continue to be.
Q: Jim, is it difficult for the President to participate in discussions on debt relief when Congress hasn't fully funded our responsibilities under that?
MS. BRAINARD: The President, I believe, will actually want very much to talk about debt relief because this is a very high personal priority for him. In particular, I think they'll want to review progress that's been made over the course of the year. Nine countries have qualified over the course of this year. They're expected to receive about $16 billion in debt reduction and will be saving about $90 million per year on debt service payments, and as many as 20 countries may actually qualify by the end of this year.
I want to give you an example or two on how this money is being used, because I think it is exactly how we were hoping it would be used. In Mozambique, even after the floods, expenditures on education and health care are going to increase from 31 percent of current expenditures to over 35 percent, an increase of $45 million. And the debt to service export ratio is going to be about 2.5 percent, a very large decline over the previous 20 percent. Similarly -- I'll give you another example -- Honduras is going to save about $130 million a year and is going to use the debt relief monies to hire a thousand new teachers, buy medicines and hospital equipment, and provide low-income housing.
On the funding front, as you may recall from last year, this was a top priority for the President. It came down to a real appropriations fight at the very end of the year and we were able to fund the bilateral portion. The House vote last week suggests that we may be making headway, and we will continue to push very, very hard to fund the multilateral portion of HIPC.
Q: Do you expect any recriminations from the other leaders over the fact that, despite your efforts, the full funding has not been forthcoming?
MS. BRAINARD: I think the leaders all recognize that the President is a leader on the debt relief issue. He led with the announcement of 100-percent bilateral debt relief, for instance. The rest of the G-8 is now on board for that, so I actually expect those discussions to be very positive and a lot of agreement in the room about what needs to be done to move forward on that.
Q: Are you expecting the two countries will be able to resolve the trade dispute over the NTT interconnection rates before the bilateral talks in Tokyo? If not, will the two leaders negotiate -- will there be talks in Tokyo? And how would that affect a G-8 discussion on digital divide, IT and so on? Now that the President is busy brokering Middle East peace at Camp David, how much attention is he paying to this particular issue? Is he briefed on a daily basis on the ongoing talks in Tokyo?
MS. BRAINARD: Well, it's not possible at this moment to predict whether the negotiations will be finished. The negotiations are ongoing. It's worth noting that the issue of NTT interconnection rates, the rates that are charged to other telecommunications providers, is going to be a very high visibility issue going into the summit. I think all of the G-7 have a similar view on this. And it is very important for Japan's bid to take the lead in the new economy, to have a new economy summit. This will be a very important signal.
Just to give you some numbers so that you know what the discrepancies are like, the rates now offered by NTT are between two to five times higher than rates available elsewhere in the G-7. The UK and the U.S. are actually the lowest -- we've got these numbers in yen, but let me just give you an example. The UK is 1.74 versus 5.57, and the gap is actually widening. They're coming down further in Europe and in the U.S. So this
is critical for Japan's competitiveness, and I think that the Japanese leadership understands that this is a big part of entering the new economy.
Q: Is the President paying attention to this issue now?
MS. BRAINARD: This is an issue that the President has raised with Prime Minister Mori and with Prime Minister Obuchi before that. So, yes, this is an issue that's very much on his radar screen.
Q: I was just wondering, you had mentioned that this is going to be a very important issue and a good signal whether an agreement is reached or not. Do you think Japan can legitimately call this an IT summit if they go into the summit without an agreement and without having their own population able to connect into the Internet, you know, economically?
MS. BRAINARD: Well, I think the agenda that Japan has set for the summit, with our strong support, will be very strong in the area of the information economy, both on the kinds of policies that the G-7 countries themselves must take to ensure that information technology is widely disseminated and widely accessible in their own economies; and also, as we were discussing earlier, to close the global digital divide.
So I think that the summit will be a strong IT summit. And I also think that is very important for Japan as it moves forward on this new technology to address the issue of the inter-connection rates.
Q: Will the President be supporting the initiative that Prime Minister Mori made on Saturday to pledge exact dollar figures to bridge the global digital divide while he's there?
MS. BRAINARD: There will be, I believe, a number of outcomes that will be supportive of the efforts to address the digital divide, as well as the education and health divides. And we're very much welcome initiatives by members of -- other members of the G-7, such as Japan, on each of these things, as well as initiatives, efforts on the part of the private sector and on the part of the multilateral organizations. This is really a summit at which the G-8 leaders will be talking about how to coordinate a response from all the many actors that have a role to play.
Q: Just a follow-up. You had mentioned earlier that the White House had been working with some private organizations about putting forth some deliverables on that. Could you just be a little bit more specific? What exactly are you guys --
MS. BRAINARD: In this area we have had a private sector group very engaged in looking at what the key obstacles many developing countries face in making full use of information technology to advance their development objectives. And the private sector has been looking at initiatives that individual companies can make and that they can make cooperatively. We're not ready to talk yet about those initiatives. I think the private sector participants are still working on how they can be supportive of this effort.
But their participation is absolutely critical. The private sector has led on the information revolution and we see them as a really key -- perhaps the key element in closing the digital divide.
Q: Are you aware, has there been any conversations with the Japanese or any of the other leaders about the possibility that the President might miss, might be delayed -- any contingency plans made for his arriving late or maybe not coming at all?
MR. STEINBERG: Let me just say, Terry, and I will reiterate. I really can't improve on what Joe said. But I'm unaware of any specific conversations with any other governments.
Q: Do you expect any improvement, progress, or even an conclusion of the negotiations over host nation support deal with Japan, over this --
MR. STEINBERG: I have a parallel answer to Lael's answer on NTT interconnection, which is that we are having ongoing discussions. Under Secretary Slocumb, I believe, is in Japan as we speak. And this is an important issue to both countries. And we are very hopeful that we can get a good resolution of that.
Q: Jim, the First Lady is not going to Okinawa, we all know why/ But is it unusual for the First Lady not to go to a G-7/G-8 summit?
MR. STEINBERG: My understanding is that a number of the spouses will not be present, so I don't think it's unusual. And it's certainly -- my experience in past ones is that some have come and some have not. So I think it's a mixed bag.
Q: President Putin is meeting President Clinton after meeting Jiang Zemin and Kim Chong-il. Is there anything about what President Clinton will do with the Korean issues with President Putin?
MR. STEINBERG: Well, I think both of these meetings are welcome. I think that we welcome Russia taking an interest in the issues of regional security. We very much hope and expect that when President Putin meets with Kim Chong-il that he will reiterate the message that the rest of the international community is giving, which is, one, to welcome the steps towards reconciliation between North and South, and to encourage North Korea to take steps to deal particularly with its missile program, both its export of missile technology and its indigenous missile program. And I think that if President Putin wants to make a positive contribution, this is a real opportunity to use this meeting, and similarly, in his discussions with President Jiang, to support efforts to reduce tensions in the region, particularly on the Korean Peninsula.
Q: He will surely raise the issue of NMD, national missile defense system. What can the E-7 do with that?
MR. STEINBERG: Well, again, I think that the most constructive thing that President Putin can do on the issue of NMD is to encourage the government of North Korea to engage with us in the missile talks, to reach some resolution on the two aspects of North Korea's missile program that we're concerned about, because our interest in and the potential need for NMD is very much driven by missile developments. We welcome the fact that North Korea has a moratorium on missile testing, but its program still continues. And if the Russians, as I think, share our view that this is potentially a matter of concern, we very much hope that they'll transmit that message.
Q: Jim, on NMD, since the President's meeting with President Putin, have you seen any hint whatsoever of softening in the Russian position or the Russian objection on adapting ABM? And, secondly, do you expect any significant progress on the rest of the arms control agenda in this meeting?
MR. STEINBERG: Well, I expect that the two Presidents are going to discuss the full range of issues, which include defenses, offensive reductions, and cooperation between our two countries. I think it's a very important part of the agenda that they set out in Moscow, and we will be continuing to look for ways to make further progress and cooperation. I'm not in the predictions business, so I don't know whether we'll have anything specific coming out of this. But as I said earlier, I noted that just recently President Putin once again acknowledged that there is some basis for our concerns. And we hope that that will translate into some common understanding.
Q: Is it the intention to announce the E.U. carousel trade sanctions before the President leaves for the summit?
MS. BRAINARD: We're continuing to review the comments from the private sector, and I don't actually have information for you on specifically when the list will be finalized for public release.
Q: Thank you.

Bill Clinton,"December 06, 2000",Remarks on Presenting the Eleanor Roosevelt Award for Human Rights and the Presidential Medal of Freedom,"The President. Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen, and good morning. Let me begin by thanking Secretary Albright for her remarks and her 8 years of leadership, first at the United Nations and then at the State Department, always standing up and speaking out for human rights.
And my friend of so many years John Lewis, whom I knew before I ever decided to run for President, who started with me, and as you can hear, is going out with me, finishing. [Laughter] In my private office on the second floor of the White House Residence, I have a picture of a very young John Lewis being beaten at the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, that I was given when we went back there on the 35th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act. And he has worked now for more than 35 years. I can't help noting that he's still at it. He had a piece in the New York Times the other day making the simple but apparently controversial point that the right to vote includes not only the right to cast the vote but the right to have it counted. Thank you, John.
I also want to welcome James Roosevelt and his wife, Ann, here, and Members of the Congress, Congressman Ben Gilman, Donald Payne, and Ed Pastor. I want to thank Sandy Berger and Eric Schwartz, who have worked at the White House on human rights since the day we got here in 1993. I want to thank, in his absence, Assistant Secretary of State Harold Koh, who tried to come back from Africa today to be here but couldn't make it, and our Ambassador to the U.N. Human Rights Commission, Nancy Rubin.
We're here today to honor six extraordinary people. Like Madeleine, I also want to say that I wish Hillary could be here, but she's at Senator school today. [Laughter] It's been a great 2 days at our house, going to Senator school. I had to make sure that—I said yesterday, I said, ""This is your first day of school, and so you have to go to bed early. Get a good night's sleep.""—[laughter]—""Wear a nice dress. It's the first day of school."" So today is the second day of school, and I'm sorry she couldn't be here.
But I will always be grateful that part of our service involved the opportunity she had to go to Beijing 5 years ago, to say that women's rights are human rights. And I'm grateful that she'll have a chance to continue that fight in the United States Senate.
I'd also like to thank Melanne Verveer, who worked with us every day for 8 years, and for Bonnie Campbell at the Department of Justice and Theresa Loar at the Department of State.
Thanks to so many of you in this room, for 8 years I've had the privilege of trying to bring Americans' actions more in line with America's beliefs. Secretary Albright and John Lewis both said we have made support for democracy and freedom of religion an important part of our foreign policy. We stood up for civil rights and against discrimination at home and abroad and made it clear that America cannot simply stand by when human rights are trampled.
Dr. King once said, ""Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere."" This is a lesson we can never afford to forget, especially in this fast-forward century, when satellites, E-mail, and jet planes expand the frontiers of human contact and human awareness and bring pain and suffering instantly home to us. Globalization is bringing us closer together, with many benefits, but as with all new benefits, new responsibilities accompany them. And we have both the moral imperative and a practical incentive to do even more to recognize the rights and dignity of every person, everywhere.
In spite of what we have accomplished, which the Secretary of State articulated so clearly, major challenges lie ahead. We can never stop striving at home to become the more perfect Union of our Founders' dreams. That means we cannot abandon the struggle against discrimination and injustice here.
Specifically, let me say, I hope that in this abbreviated session of the Congress, that Congress will send me the hate crimes legislation that we worked so hard for, and which both Houses have voted for, but which a minority may yet be able to prevent. If we don't get it, I certainly hope it's one of the first pieces of legislation the next administration will ask for and sign into law.
We also must continue to support emerging democracies abroad. That means, of course, support for free and fair elections but also support for strong democratic institutions, good governance in the fight against corruption, speaking out when the progress of democracy or the most basic human rights are under threat, whether it's the scourge of slavery in Sudan, the denial of rights to women and girls in Afghanistan, curtailing religious freedom in China.
And let me say especially to the students, religious communities, and human rights activists who have done so much to publicize the atrocities of Sudan, America must continue to press for an end to these egregious practices and make clear that the Sudanese Government cannot join the community of nations until fundamental changes are made on these fronts.
Ultimately, support for human rights means preparing to act to stop suffering and violence when our values and our interests demand it. We cannot right every wrong, of course, but we cannot choose inaction, either. I have been reminded again and again that much of the best work in promoting human rights and defending freedom is done by people outside Government, students, activists, religious leaders from all walks of life, sharing an unshakable belief in the simple message of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, that all humans are free and equal in dignity and rights.
Ten years after the signing of the Universal Declaration, Eleanor Roosevelt reminded us that the destiny of human rights is in the hands of all our citizens and all our communities. I established the Eleanor Roosevelt Human Rights Awards to honor men and women who have taken the future of human rights into their committed hands. I have had the honor of working closely with several of this year's honorees and the equal honor of receiving advice and, on occasion, criticism from them, as well. So I would like to say a few words about each.
To the Lakota Sioux, the birth of a white buffalo calf is a sign of peace and harmony to come, a prophecy of the end of war and, especially, of the suffering of children. When Tillie Black Bear founded the White Buffalo Calf Women's Society more than 20 years ago, she sought to end the suffering of women and children who were victims of domestic violence. She founded the first women's shelter on an Indian reservation and then went on to help found two more.
A survivor of domestic violence herself, she has taught and counseled victims, batterers, and law enforcement officials alike. She is a founder and former president of the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault and known around the Nation as a leading advocate for battered women.
I want to add that, fittingly, Tillie was born on Human Rights Day, December the 10th. We thank her for her courage and a lifetime of commitment.
From the tall tales he loved to tell, to the size of his ambitions, Fred Cuny was larger than life in every sense. But the biggest thing about him was his heart and his devotion to saving lives anywhere he could. He participated in more than 70 relief missions to some of the world's most desolate places. And wherever he went, he made a lasting difference.
In Bosnia, he smuggled in enough equipment to build two water purification plants under snipers' noses, providing clean drinking water for 60 percent of the city during the worst days of the siege. General Shalikashvili called him ""the hero"" of our operations to help starving Kurds in Northern Iraq.
His last mission, like so many others, was to a remote and dangerous place where outsiders rarely go but where help was desperately needed. That place was Chechnya, and Fred Cuny was killed there 5 years ago. His son, Craig, is here today to accept his father's award. And we thank him and all the Cuny family— and there are lots of them here, thank goodness—for the life of one of America's and the world's great humanitarians. Thank you.
The story I am about to tell will not surprise anyone who has ever had any contact with Elaine Jones. She argued her first court case at the tender age of 11. She visited a dentist without getting her parents' permission, and when she couldn't pay the bill, the dentist decided to sue. Her parents had to work, so Elaine went to court alone and convinced the judge to dismiss the case. I wonder what the argument was? [Laughter]
That's when she decided she wanted to be a lawyer, and she's been speaking truth to power ever since. She was the first African-American woman to graduate from the University of Virginia Law School; later, the first African-American to sit on the American Bar Association board of governors. With a brief interruption for Government service, she's been a leader in the NAACP's fight for equal justice for almost 25 years now. She is an ardent advocate before Congress, a skillful litigator before the Supreme Court, a constant voice for people in need.
Thank you, Elaine, for being a champion of human rights for all Americans.
In the spring of 1954, a young Army Lieutenant named Norman Dorsen found himself on the frontlines of justice in his very first job out of law school, defending civil liberties from the attacks of Senator Joe McCarthy. Now, Norman has had other jobs and responsibilities, but he never abandoned his post in the struggle to preserve the rights and liberties of every American.
He argued and prepared briefs for landmark Supreme Court cases, such as Gideon v. Wainright, which established an accused person's right to legal counsel. He was, for 15 years, the President of the American Civil Liberties Union. He is now chairman of the board of the Lawyers' Committee for Human Rights. For almost 40 years, he's inspired law students as a professor at New York University Law School and director of its programs in civil liberties.
I've gotten to know him through our discussions of a political Third Way, but today we thank him for reminding us that in every age, respect for civil liberties is the American way. Thank you, Norman.
In tough places, where civilians are struggling to get out, chances are you will find Archbishop Theodore McCarrick working hard to get in and to help them. The litany of countries he has visited sounds more suited to a diplomat than an archbishop: the former Soviet Union, the Balkans, the countries devastated by Hurricane Mitch, East Timor, Ethiopia, Burundi, Cuba, Haiti, Colombia.
Two years ago I was honored to send him as one of my representatives on a groundbreaking trip to discuss religious freedom with China's leaders. This year, he has been a tireless and effective leader in promoting debt relief for poor countries—I might say, one of the truly outstanding accomplishments that we have achieved in a bipartisan fashion in this town in the last 5 years. It's an amazing thing.
At the same time, the Archbishop is much beloved for practicing at home what he preaches around the world. This year, as he pressed the United States to fund debt relief, he forgave the $10 million in debts of poor parishes in his Newark diocese.
Archbishop, we thank you for your devotion to all God's children, and we welcome you to your new home in the diocese of Washington, DC.
These five Americans have made our Nation and the world a better place. May they continue to inspire and guide us all for years to come.
Major, read the citations.
[ At this point, Maj. William F. Mullen III, USMC, Marine Corps Aide to the President, read the citations, and the President presented the Eleanor Roosevelt Awards for Human Rights.]
The President. Do you want to know what Elaine said to me? [Laughter] So I said, ""Well, what argument did you make when you were 11 years old?"" She said, ""I said he didn't have permission to take all those X rays. I mean, I was just 11 years old."" [Laughter] So this guy was supposed to be the only person on Earth who could have said no to her. [Laughter] We need you now, girl. That's good. That's good. [Laughter]
The Presidential Medal of Freedom was created by President Truman to honor noble service in times of war. It was expanded by President Kennedy to honor service in times of peace. I have been privileged to award the medal to many champions of liberty.
Today we continue that tradition with a difference. The person we honor, Aung San Suu Kyi of Burma, cannot be with us. In fact, she doesn't even know we're here today, thinking of her and her struggle in her country. She sits confined, as we speak here, in her home in Rangoon, unable to speak to her people or the world. But her struggle continues, and her spirit still inspires us.
Twelve years ago she went home to Burma to visit her ailing mother and found herself at the helm of a popular movement for democracy and human rights. A decade ago, she led her persecuted party in parliamentary elections that were neither free nor fair; yet they still won 80 percent of the seats. Her victory has never been recognized by the Government of Burma, but her hold on the hearts of the people in Burma has never been broken.
In the years since, she had seen her supporters beaten, tortured, and killed, yet she has never responded to hatred and violence in kind. All she has ever asked for is peaceful dialog. She has been treated without mercy, yet she has preached forgiveness, promising that in a democratic Burma there will be no retribution and nothing but honor and respect for the military.
No one has done more than she to teach us that the desire for liberty is universal, that it is a matter of conscience, not culture. When her son, Alexander, accepted her Nobel Peace Prize, he said she would never accept such an honor in her name, but only in the name of all the people of Burma. I imagine she would say the same thing today—that she would tell us that for all she has suffered, the separation from her family, the loss of her beloved husband, nothing compares to what the Burmese people, themselves, have endured—years of tyranny and poverty in a land of such inherent promise.
Our thoughts are with them. This medal stands for our determination to help them see a better day. The only weapons the Burmese people have are words, reason, and the example of this astonishing, brave woman. Let us add our voices to their peaceful arsenal. Keep using every instrument of influence to support Aung San Suu Kyi's quest for democracy through dialog.
Those who rule Burma should know that they can regain their place in the world only when they regain the trust of their own people and respect their chosen leaders. And the woman we honor today should know, America will always be a friend to freedom in Burma—a friend for as long as it takes to reach the goal for which she has sacrificed so very much.
I would like to ask Alexander to come up here, and I'd like to ask the major to read the citation.
[ At this point, Major Mullen read the citation, and the President presented the Presidential Medal of Freedom.]
The President. Thank you all for coming today. We are adjourned.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-presenting-the-eleanor-roosevelt-award-for-human-rights-and-the-presidential-medal
Bill Clinton,"December 08, 2000","Remarks at the University of Nebraska at Kearney, Nebraska","Thank you very much. Didn't Casey do a good job? [Applause] She was great. I'd like to thank Chancellor Johnston for her kind remarks and the honorary degree. And thank you, President Smith, and members of the board of trustees, to both the students and the other members.
Thank you, Governor, for your welcome. And I thank the other State officials who are here. I am especially grateful that my long-time friend and former colleague as Governor, your retiring Senator, Bob Kerrey, flew down here with me today. Thank you, Bob, for your service, along with our former Nebraska Congressman, Peter Hoagland. Thank you for coming with me. I congratulate Ben Nelson on his election to the United States Senate. Governor Morrison, thank you for being here today.
And I want to say a special word of thanks to my great friend, your former Senator, Jim Exon, who persuaded me to come here and to come to Kearney. He said—[inaudible]— should be here.
When I came in here and I looked at this crowd, one of my staff members joked that we had found a building in Nebraska that would hold every single Democrat—[laughter]—and a few charitable Republicans, to boot. [Laughter]
Let me say, I'm glad that I finally made it to Nebraska. There were a lot of signs outside that said, ""You saved the best till last."" [Laughter] And I saw the patriotism and the spirit of the people, all the children holding the American flags. It was very, very moving, coming in. All the schools were let out, and there were hundreds and hundreds of people along the way. And it made us a little bit late, and for that, I'm sorry. But I did actually stop, and we got out and shook hands with one group of schoolchildren there just to thank them for being in the cold. So I thank them for that.
I was also reminded at the airport that we are literally in the heartland of America. A gentleman at the airport gave me a sweatshirt that had a little map of Nebraska with Kearney, and it had a line and it said, ""1,300 miles to New York and 1,300 miles to San Francisco.""
Most Americans have probably forgotten this, but back in the 1870's, there was actually talk of relocating our Nation's Capital away from Washington, DC, to a more central location. And a local publisher in this community, named Moses Henry Sydenham, launched a national campaign to nominate Kearney for the Nation's Capital. He promised to rename it ""New Washington"" and to use the real estate profits to pay off the national debt. [Laughter]
Critics of his proposal asked him what in the world he would do with all those big, fancy buildings in old Washington. He said it was simple. He would turn them into asylums. [Laughter] Well, history took a different course, except for that part about turning those buildings into asylums. [Laughter] I have occupied one for the last 8 years.
And we are finally paying off the national debt, which is good. [Applause] Thank you. But since half of Washington is in Kearney today, maybe we should think again about moving the Capital. I rather like it here. [Laughter]
I want to say again, I thank the people of this community for a wonderful welcome, and all of you in the university community, especially. I also want to say again how impressed I was by what Casey had to say. Because I came here today not just to keep my promise to visit Nebraska but to keep working on something at the very end of my term I have been trying for 8 years to do, which is to persuade ordinary, hard-working American citizens in the heartland of America that you should be concerned about what goes on beyond our Nation's borders and what our role in the rest of the world is, because the world is growing smaller and smaller and more interdependent. Every Nebraska farmer knows that. And indeed, when Senator Kerrey and I visited the units of the Nebraska Air National Guard out there, we asked them where the guardsmen were. We found out that you have some Nebraska guardsman now still in Kosovo. So we are personally affected by it.
But I don't think I have still—people say I'm a pretty good talker, but I still don't think I've persuaded the American people by big majorities that you really ought to care a lot about foreign policy, about our relationship to the rest of the world, about what we're doing. And the reason is, in an interdependent world, we are all directly affected by what goes on beyond our borders—sure, in economics, but in other ways, as well—and by what we decide to do or not do about it.
This is an immensely patriotic community. That's one thing Bob Kerrey kept saying over and over again, ""Look at all those people holding the flag. These people love their country."" But what we have to do is be wise patriots. This country is still around after 224 years because our Founders not only loved our country; they were smart. They were smart enough to figure out how to give us a system that, as we have seen in the last few weeks, can survive just about anything. [Laughter]
And I want to ask you again today, just give me a few minutes to make the case in the heartland about why there is no longer a clear, bright line dividing America's domestic concerns and America's foreign policy concerns and why every American who wants to be a good citizen, who wants to vote in every election, should know more about the rest of the world and have a clearer idea about what we're supposed to be doing out there and how it affects how you live in Kearney. Because I think it is profoundly important.
Let's start with a few basics. Never before have we enjoyed at the same time so much prosperity and social progress with the absence of domestic crisis or overwhelming foreign threats. We're in the midst of the longest economic expansion in our history, with the lowest unemployment rate in 30 years, the lowest welfare rolls in 32 years, the lowest crime rates in 27 years, 3 years of surpluses in a row, and 3 years of paying down the national debt for the first time in 50 years, the highest homeownership and college-going rate in history. Today we learned that the November unemployment rate was 4 percent, staying at that 30year low.
Now, this is good news for America. But there is good news beyond our borders for our values and our interests. In the last few years, for the first time in all human history, more than half the people on the face of the Earth live under governments that they voted for, that they chose.
And more and more, even in nations that have not yet completely embraced democracy, more and more people, especially young people, see our creative, entrepreneurial society with more and more personal freedom as the model for the success they want. Last month I went to Vietnam, where America fought in a very difficult war for a long time, where Senator Kerrey earned the Medal of Honor and nearly 60,000 Americans died, and 3 million Vietnamese died on both sides of the conflict.
So I was interested to see what sort of a reception that I would get and the United States would get, because the Government there remains in the hands of a Communist leadership. And frankly, some of them didn't know what to make about America showing up. But everywhere I went, from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, tens of thousands of people appeared out of nowhere. Not for me, for America; for the idea of America. Sixty percent of the people who live in Vietnam are under 30. Because of the tragedy of the war, only 5 percent are over 60.
But the ones under 30 like what they know about America. They want to be our partners in the future, and they want to have the chance to build the kind of future they think young people in this country have. That is a priceless gift.
So the first thing I want to say, especially to the young people here, is that we should all be grateful that we are so fortunate to be alive at this moment of prosperity, military and political power, social progress, and prestige for America.
But the really important question is, what do we intend to make of this moment? Will we be grateful but basically complacent, being the political equivalent of couch potatoes? Will we assume that in this era of the Internet, freedom, peace, and prosperity will just spread? That all we have to do is kind of sit back, hook the world up to AOL, and wait for people to beat their swords into shares on the NASDAQ? [Laughter] Or will we understand that no change is inevitable—change is inevitable, but the particular change is not. And we have to actually make some decisions if we're going to seize the opportunities and meet the challenges before us.
To put it in another way, the train of globalization cannot be reversed, but it has more than one possible destination. If we want America to stay on the right track, if we want other people to be on that track and have the chance to enjoy peace and prosperity, we have no choice but to try to lead the train.
For example, you all applauded when I said more than half the people in the world live under governments of their own choosing for the first time in history. We'd like to keep that process going. But we know that democracy in some places is fragile, and it could be reversed.
We want more nations to see ethnic and religious diversity as a source of strength. You know what the chancellor said when the choir was singing? I said, ""Boy, they're good."" She said, ""They got a lot more rhythm since I came here""—we're laughing. [Laughter]
Casey talked about her Hispanic heritage. I was shaking hands with these kids out on the street, and about the third young boy I shook hands with was of Asian descent. This is a more interesting country than it has ever been. Everywhere I go—I mean, you can't be President anymore unless you understand the concerns of at least 50 different groups.
It's an interesting thing. For us, this is a big plus, even though we still have our problems with hate crimes and racial or religious or other instances. But basically, our diversity has come to be something that makes life more interesting in America, because we realize that what unites us is more important than what divides us, that our common humanity anchors us in a way that allows us to feel secure about our differences, so we can celebrate them. And this is important.
I don't like to use the word ""tolerance"" in this context, because tolerance implies that there's a dominant culture putting up with a subordinate one. I don't really think that's where we're going as America. I think we're going to the point where we say, ""Here are our common values, and if you sign on to those, we respect you; we treat you as an equal; and we celebrate and find interesting the differences.""
Now, that's what we would like for every place. And we know that if everybody deals that way, that America's going to do very well in the global society of the 21st century, because there's somebody here from everywhere else. And that's good. You know, we're going to do very, very well, as the world becomes more interdependent. So that's the outcome we want.
But all we have to do is read the paper everyday to know that old hatreds die hard. And their persistence, from Bosnia and Kosovo to the Middle East to Northern Ireland to the African tribal wars to places like East Timor, have in our time led to hundreds of thousands of deaths and countries being impoverished, for 10 years or more, because people couldn't give up their old hatreds to build a new future together.
So how this comes out is not at all inevitable. We want global trade to keep our economy growing. Nebraska farmers like it when people open their markets and the most efficient farmers in the world can sell their food to people who need to buy it. But it is possible that financial crisis abroad could wreck that system, as farmers here found out when the Asian financial crisis hit a couple years ago, or that alienation from global capitalism by people who aren't a part of it will drive whole countries away. We want global trade to lift hundreds of millions of people out of poverty, from India to China to Africa. We know if it happens, it will create a big market for everything American, from corn to cars to computers. And it will give all of us new ideas and new innovation, and we'll all help each other in constructive competition.
But the gap between rich and poor nations could continue to widen and bring more misery, more environmental destruction, more health problems, more and more young people in poor countries just checking out of wanting to be part of a global system, because they think there is nothing in it for them.
We want advances in technology to keep making our lives better. I went last year to that annual show in Chicago of all the latest hightech gadgets. And I held in my hand, in my palm, a little plastic computer—with a complete keyboard that I held in my hand, that also was connected to the Internet. And I was getting CNN on those tiny little—I don't see well enough in my old age to even use the thing. It's so small, and my hands were too big to effectively use the keyboard, it was so small. Very exciting.
But the same technological breakthroughs that put that computer in the palm of my hand could end up making it possible to create smaller and smaller chemical or biological or nuclear weapons in the hands of terrorists. And all the things we're learning about computers will be learned by people who, because they belong to organized crime units or narcotraffickers or terrorists, would like to pierce our secure networks and get information or spread viruses that wreck our most vital systems.
So I'm a wild-eyed optimist. But I've lived long enough to know that things can happen that are not necessarily what you want, and that every opportunity brings with it new responsibilities because the organized forces of destruction can take advantage of them, all these opportunities, too.
A long time ago, one of your citizens, William Jennings Bryan, said, ""Our destiny is a matter of choice. It is not a thing to be waited for. It is a thing to be achieved."" We have to continue to achieve America's destiny. And the point I want to make is that it cannot be achieved in the 21st century without American citizens who care about, know about, and understand what is going on beyond our borders and what we're supposed to do about it.
Now, for the last 8 years, I've had the honor of working with people in Congress, principled people of both parties, like both your Senators, Bob Kerrey and Chuck Hagel, to try to make a choice for American leadership in the postcold war, global information age. I think it's been good for America and for people around the world. And as I leave office, I think America should continue to build a foreign policy for the global age based on five broad principles, which I would like to briefly state and explain.
First, everything we want to achieve in the world, just about, depends upon maintaining strong alliances with people who share our interests and our values and adapting those alliances to meet today's and tomorrow's challenges. For example, our most important alliance with Europe is the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, NATO. It was organized to defend Europe against the Soviet Union in the cold war. When I became President, the cold war was over, and the alliance was in doubt. What's it for, anyway? Who's going to be in it? What's it supposed to do?
But the values that we shared with Europe and the interest we shared were very much threatened when I became President by a vicious, genocidal war in Bosnia. Our European Allies were aiding the victims heroically, but unintentionally shielding the victimizers by not stopping them. And for the first time since World War II, America was refusing to help to defeat a serious threat to peace in Europe. But all that's changed. America decided to lead. Our European Allies decided to work with us. We revitalized the NATO Alliance. We gave it new missions, new members from behind the old Iron Curtain, a new partnership with Russia.
We finally ended the war in Bosnia. We negotiated a peace that grows stronger, steadily. When ethnic cleansing erupted in Kosovo, we acted decisively to stop that and send almost a million people back home.
Today, the Serbian leader who began the Balkan wars, Slobodan Milosevic, has been deposed by his own people. And instead of fighting something bad, we're trying to finish something worthy, a Europe that is united, democratic, and peaceful, completely for the first time in all human history. That takes a big burden off America in the future and give us a big, big set of economic and political partners to deal with the world's challenges.
Now, here's the decision for today. Do we believe that we did the right thing or not? If we do, we have to stay the course, keep expanding NATO, keep working with the Russians, keep burdensharing to do what needs to be done. I don't think most people know this, but in Kosovo today, we provide less than 20 percent of the troops and the funds. But we would not be there as an alliance if the United States had not agreed to do its part. America cannot lead if we walk away from our friends and our neighbors.
The same thing is true in Asia. We fought three wars in Asia in the 20th century. Huge numbers of Americans died there, from World War II through Korea, through Vietnam. What should we do now that the cold war is over, but the future is uncertain? What we have done is to decide to keep our troops in the Pacific, to renew our alliance with Japan. We sent ships to keep tensions from escalating between China and Taiwan. We stood by South Korea and diminished the nuclear threat from North Korea, and we supported the South Korean President's decision to seek to end 50 years of tension on the Korean Peninsula, for which he justifiably won the Nobel Peace Prize.
Should we withdraw from Asia? I don't think so. I think we ought to stay there, modernize our alliances, and keep the peace so we don't have to fight any more wars in the 21st century.
The third thing I want to say about the alliances is that the 21st century world is going to be about more than great power politics, which means we can't just think about East Asia and Europe. We need a systematic, committed, long-term relationship with our neighbors in Latin America and the Caribbean, with South Asia—next to China, the most populous place on Earth—and with Africa, where 800 million people live.
One of the most—[applause]—yes, you can clap for that. That's all right. So I think that's important. We've been estranged from India for 50 years. Do you know how many people live in India? Nine hundred and eighty million. In 30 years India will be more populous than China.
In Silicon Valley today, there are 700 hightech companies headed by Indians—700, in one place. This is totally off the radar screen of American policy during the cold war. So I would encourage all of you who, like Casey, are involved in some sort of international studies, not to just think about America's traditional concerns but to think about what we're going to do with Latin America and the Caribbean, with sub-Saharan Africa and with south Asia, because a lot of our future will be there.
So beyond alliances, the second principle is that we have to build, if we can, constructive relationships with our former adversaries Russia and China. One of the big questions that will define the world for the next 10 years is, how will Russia and China define their greatness in the 21st century? Will they define it as their ability to dominate their neighbors or to control their own people? Or will they define it in a more modern sense, in their ability to develop their people's capacity to cooperate with their neighbors, to compete and win in a global economy and a global society?
What decision they make will have a huge impact on how every young person in this audience lives. It will define what kind of defense budget we have to have, how many folks we have to enroll in the armed services, where we have to send them, what we have to do. It's huge. Now, we cannot make that decision for Russia or for China. They'll make that decision for themselves. But we can control what we do, and what we do will have some impact on what they decide.
So we should say to them what we've been trying to say for 8 years: If you will accept the rules and the responsibilities of membership in the world community, we want to make sure you get the full benefits and be a full partner, not a junior partner. We also have to say, we have to feel free to speak firmly and honestly when we think what you do is wrong by international standards.
When we've worked together with Russia in a positive way, we've made real progress. Russia took its troops out of Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia and put them in joint missions with NATO, something nobody ever thought would happen. We're serving together in Bosnia and Kosovo. Russia helped us find a just end to the war in Kosovo. They worked with us to eliminate 5,000 nuclear warheads from the old Soviet Union and safeguard those that are still there.
Now, do we agree with everything in Russia? No. We think there has been too much corruption at times. We don't agree with wars in Chechnya we think were cruel and self-defeating. We don't agree with backsliding on the free press that we see. But we need a little perspective here. When I went to Moscow for the first time as President, in 1993, people were still lining up for bread, recovering from inflation that got to 2,500 percent. Many people were predicting that an impoverished Russia would go back to communism or turn to fascism.
Since then, Russia has had five—five—free elections. And every time, people have voted to deepen democracy, not to weaken it. The economy is growing. Now, are the positive trends inevitable? No, but they are more than possible. And it's in our interests to encourage them.
The same thing is true in China. We have tried to encourage change by bringing China into international systems, where there are rules and responsibilities, from nonproliferation to trade. That's what I think will happen with China coming into the World Trade Organization. It is a statement by them, by agreeing to the conditions of membership, that they can't succeed over the long run without opening to the world. It is a declaration of interdependence.
It increases the chance that they'll make a good decision, rather than a negative one, about what they're going to do in the 21st century world. And if China goes on and follows through with this, they'll have to dismantle a lot of their old command-and-control economy, which gave the Communist Party so much power. They'll open their doors to more foreign investment and more foreign information and the Internet revolution. Will it inevitably bring freedom? No, but it will increase the chances of China taking the right course.
So I believe if we stay with this course, one of the most profoundly positive changes the generation of young people in this audience will see could be the change that ultimately comes to China. And I told you the Vietnam story. I felt the same thing in Shanghai. I felt the same thing walking in little villages and talking to people who were electing their mayors for the first time in China, where there are, at least now, a million local villages electing their local officials. So, alliances, constructive relations with Russia and China.
The third thing we have to recognize is that local conflicts can become worldwide headaches if they're allowed to fester. Therefore, whenever possible, we should stop them before they get out of hand. That's why we've worked for peace in the Balkans, between Greece and Turkey on Cyprus, between India and Pakistan, Ethiopia and Eritrea. That's why I'm going back to Northern Ireland next week, the land of my ancestors. And it's why we've worked so hard to make America a force for peace in the Middle East, the home of the world's three great monotheistic religions, where God is reminding us every day that we are not in control.
But we have made a lot of progress. We've seen a peace treaty between Israel and Jordan. We saw a sweeping agreement between the Israelis and the Palestinians and progress toward implementing it over the last 8 years. But what's happened is, they're down to the hedgerows now and the hard decisions, and they've gotten to those fundamental identity questions, where they have to decide what I was talking about earlier. Is it possible for them to look at each other and see their common humanity and find a solution in which neither side can say, ""I have vanquished the other,"" or have there been so many years of history welling up inside them that neither side can let go? That is the issue, and we will continue to work on it.
But the main point I want to make to you is, you should want your President and your Government involved in these things, and you should support your Congress if they invest some of your money in the cause of peace and development in these hotspots in the world.
And let me say again: This is not inconsistent with saying that people ought to take the lead in their own backyard. I think most Americans feel if the Europeans can take the lead in Europe, they ought to do it. The same thing with the Asians in Asia and the Africans in Africa.
What I want you to understand is that we have unique capabilities and unique confidencebuilding capacity in so many parts of the world that if we're just involved a little bit, we can make a huge difference. Our role was critical in the Balkans, but it was also critical in East Timor. Do you remember when all those people were getting killed in East Timor? You saw it on television every night. And people that couldn't find it on a map, all of a sudden were living with it every single night.
We provided about 500 troops to provide support for the international operations the Australians led there. But it made all the difference. We're training peacekeepers in Sierra Leone. They don't want us to go there and fight, but they want us to train the peacekeepers.
We've been involved in trying to settle a war between Ethiopia and Eritrea that has claimed over 60,000 lives, that most people don't know much about, but could cause us a world of trouble. And besides, it's just tragic.
We had 10 people—10, total—in the jungle when we settled the conflict between East Ecuador and Peru and got them to agree—but they couldn't agree to let it go unless we, America, agreed to send 10 people into a remote place on the border of these two countries, because they knew we could be trusted to do what they had agreed ought to be done. Now, you ought to be proud of that for your country.
But the only point I want to make is, we should do things with other people, and they ought to do their part in their own backyard. But we're in a unique position in history now. There is no other military superpower or economic superpower. And we can do some things, because we've maintained a strong military, nobody else can do.
And I'll be gone in a few weeks, and America will have a new President and a new Congress, but you ought to support them when they want to do these things, because it's very, very important to the stability and future of the world.
One other thing I want to say. We ought to pay our U.N. dues and pay our fair share of peacekeeping operations. Now, nobody in the world benefits from stability more than we do. Nobody. Nobody makes more money out of it. Just think about pure, naked self-interest. Nobody. And when we pay for this peacekeeping— I'll say more about it in a minute—but we get more than our money's worth out of it. And when we walk away from our responsibilities, people resent us. They resent our prosperity; they resent our power; and, in the end, when a whole lot of people resent you, sooner or later they find some way to manifest it. When we work with each other and do things that we don't just have to do in the moment, we build a common future.
The fourth point I would like to make to you is that this growing openness of borders and technology is changing our national security priorities. People, information, ideas, and goods move around more freely and faster than ever before. That makes us more vulnerable first to the organized forces of destruction, narcotraffickers, terrorists, organized criminals— they are going to work more and more together, with growing access to more and more sophisticated technology.
Part of the challenge is just to get rid of as many weapons of mass destruction as possible. That's why we got the states of the former Soviet Union outside Russia to give up their nuclear arsenals, and we negotiated a worldwide treaty to ban chemical weapons. That's why we forced Iraq to sell its oil for money that can go to food and medicine, but not to rebuilding its weapons. And I think the other countries of the world that are willing to let them spend that money rebuilding their weapons systems are wrong. And I hope that we can strengthen the resolve of the world not to let Saddam Hussein rebuild the chemical weapons network and other weapons systems that are bad.
It's why we negotiated a freeze on plutonium production with North Korea. Now, dealing with terrorists is harder, as we have seen in the tragedy of the U.S.S. Cole. Why? Because terrorists, unlike countries, cannot be contained as easily, and it's harder to deter them through threats of retaliation. They operate across borders, so we have got to strengthen our cooperation across borders. We have succeeded in preventing a lot of terrorist attacks. There were many planned during the millennium celebration that we prevented.
We have arrested a lot of terrorists, including those who bombed the World Trade Center and those who were involved in several other killings in this country. And make no mistake about it: We will do the same for those who killed our brave Navy personnel on the U.S.S. Cole.
But the most important thing is to prevent bad things from happening. And one of the biggest threats to the future is going to be cyberterrorism—people fooling with your computer networks, trying to shut down your phones, erase bank records, mess up airline schedules, do things to interrupt the fabric of life.
Now, we have the first national strategy to protect America's computer systems and critical infrastructure against that kind of sabotage. It includes, interestingly enough, a scholarship-forservice program to help students who are studying information security and technology, pay for their education if they will give us a couple of years' service in the Government. It's really hard to get talented people in the Government, because we can't pay them enough. You've got 27-year-old young people worth $200 or $300 million if they start the right kind of dot-com company. It's pretty hard to say, ""Come be a GS-13,"" you know? [Laughter]
But if we can educate enough people, we can at least get them in their early years, and that's important. We funded this program for the very first time this year, thanks to bipartisan support. And let me say, I'd also like to congratulate the University of Nebraska—some of you perhaps know this, but Nebraska has set up a new information assurance center which is dedicated to the same exact goal. We need more universities to follow your lead. This is going to be a big deal in the future, a big deal.
There are other new things you need to think about in national security terms. Climate change could become a national security issue. The last decade was the warmest in a thousand years. If the next 50 years are as warm as the last decade, you will see the beginning of flooding of the sugarcane fields in Louisiana and the Florida Everglades; you will see the patterns of agricultural production in America begin to shift. It's still cold enough in Nebraska; you'll probably be all right for another 50 years. [Laughter] I mean, we laugh about this; this is a serious thing.
Already, in Africa, we see malaria at higher and higher levels than ever before, where it used to be too cool for the mosquitoes. This is a serious problem. And the only way to fix it is to figure out a way for people to get rich without putting more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. In other words, we have to change the rules that governed the industrial revolution. And you can play a big role in that, too.
Why? Because scientists today are researching more efficient ways of making ethanol and other biomass fuels. I always supported that, but the real problem with ethanol, you should know, is, is that the conversion ratio is pretty low. It takes about 7 gallons of gasoline to make about 8 gallons of ethanol. But scientific research now is very close to the equivalent of what happened when we turned crude oil into refined gasoline, when we cracked the petroleum molecule.
In other words, they're very close to figuring out how to change the conversion ratio from 7 gallons of gasoline to 8 gallons of ethanol to one gallon of gasoline per 8 gallons of ethanol. When that happens, everybody is all of a sudden getting 500 miles to the gallon, and the whole future of the world is different. And you don't have to use corn, either. You can use rice hulls; you can use grasses on range land. You can do anything. You can do this. This is going to be a big deal.
If I were—no offense, Mr. President—if I were the president of the University of Nebraska, whatever I was spending on that, I'd double it. [Laughter] Because if we can do this one thing, if we can do—or you could ask the Department of Agriculture to give you some more money, because we've got some more— [laughter]—because the Congress gave us a lot more money this year.
We're all laughing about this, but you think about it. One-third of this problem is transportation. It's an issue. Some people made fun of us a few months ago when we said we considered AIDS a national security issue. You know why? In some southern African countries, it is estimated that half of all the 15-year-olds will die of AIDS. There are four African countries which, within a couple of—a few years, there will be more people over 60 than people under 30.
It is estimated that AIDS will keep South Africa's GDP income 17 percent lower than it otherwise would have been 10 years from now.
That obviously makes it harder for them to preserve their democracy, doesn't it, and to give jobs to their children. So that's why we're involved in this international AIDS effort for a vaccine, for more affordable medicines, for better care. It's an important foreign policy issue. Our effort to relieve the debt of the world's poorest countries is a very important foreign policy issue.
Our efforts to help people rebuild their public health systems—they all collapsed, and a lot of the countries of the former Soviet Union, they now have the highest AIDS growth rates in the world because they don't have any public health systems anymore. And all these things will affect whether these countries are breeding grounds for terrorists, whether the narcotraffickers in the places where drugs can be grown will get a foothold, whether we can build a different future. So I hope you will think about that.
The last thing I want to say is that the final principle ought to be, we should be for more open trade, but we have to build a global economy with a more human face. We win in the trade wars, or the trade—not wars, the trade competition. And I know that Nebraska is more—I have not persuaded my fellow Americans of that either, entirely, but in Nebraska, because of the agricultural presence here, has been generally more pro-free trade.
But these 300 trade agreements, from NASA to the World Trade Organization and many others that we negotiated, 300 of them, have given us the longest economic expansion in history. Over 25 percent of our growth is tied to trade now.
Here's the problem: The benefits have not been felt in much of the rest of the world. Eight hundred million people still go hungry every day. More than a billion people have no access to clean water. More than a billion people live on less than a dollar a day. Every year 6 million undernourished boys and girls under the age of 5 die. So if the next President and the next Congress want to spend some of your money to relieve the burden of the world's poorest countries and debt, if they'll put the money into education and health care and development, if they want to spend some money fighting AIDS, if they want to expand a program that we have done a lot with—the microcredit program, which loans money to entrepreneurs in poor countries—we made 2 million of those loans last year—if they want to double, triple, or quadruple it, I hope you will support that.
If they want to close the digital divide so that people in, let's say, a mountain village in Bolivia can be hooked up to the Internet to sell their rugs that they knit to Bloomingdale's in New York, I hope you will support that. You know why? Bolivia is the poorest country in the Andes, but they've done the best job of getting rid of the narcotraffickers. And so far, they don't have a lot to show for it, because they're still the poorest country. And it would cost us a pittance of what it cost to deal with the drug problem once these drugs show up in America to help those good, honest poor people who are so proud and honorable that they do not want to tolerate the narcotraffickers to make a decent living from their efforts.
Anyway, that's what I want to say. We've got to keep building these alliances; we've got to try to have constructive relationships with Russia and China. We've got to realize there are other places in the world that we haven't fooled with enough. We have to understand the new security challenges of the 21st century. We have to keep building a global economy, because it's the engine of the global society, but we have to do more to put a human face on it.
Fifty years ago Harry Truman said something that's more true today than it was when he said it. Listen to this: ""We are in the position now of making the world safe for democracy if we don't crawl in the shell and act selfish and foolish."" We still haven't fully—you probably all say you agree with that, but there are practical consequences.
For example, Congress agreed this fall to fund our obligations to the U.N. But because Congress hasn't finished the overall Federal budget, the agreement is at risk, and Congress has got to send me the money pretty soon, or if it doesn't, literally, the very future of the United Nations will be in jeopardy. How would you feel if you picked up the paper and the Secretary-General of the United Nations said, ""I'm sorry, we're going to have to close down for a few weeks because the United States won't pay its dues""?
What will that do to us? They share the burden with us of keeping the peace, fighting hunger, protecting the environment, advancing human rights. Listen to this. When you hear people say America spends too much, just listen to this: Right now, at a time when we are the world's only superpower with the strongest economy in the world, less than one in every 800 United Nations peacekeepers is an American—less than one in 800.
Less than 2 percent of our men and women in uniform are involved in ongoing military operations abroad of any kind. Our annual global budget—for everything from diminishing the nuclear threat to preventing conflict to advancing democracy to fighting AIDS—is no more than what Americans spend each year on dietary supplements—in my case with mixed results. [Laughter] I want you to laugh about it, because I want you to remember that this is a big deal.
We must not squander the best moment in our history on smallmindedness. We don't have to be fearful. We've got the strongest military in the world, and in history, and we're going to keep it that way. We don't have to be cheap. Our economy is the envy of the world. We don't have to swim against the currents of the world. The momentum of history is on our side, on the side of freedom and openness and competition. And we don't have the excuse of ignorance, because we've got a 24-hour global news cycle. So we know what's going on out there.
We can no longer separate America's fate from the world any more than you could celebrate Nebraska's fate from America's, or Kearney's fate from Nebraska's. So that's what I came here to say. I hope that in the years ahead the heartland of America will say, America chooses to be a part of the world, with a clear head and a strong heart; to share the risks and the opportunities of the world; to work with others until ultimately there is a global community of free nations, working with us, for peace and security, where everybody counts and everybody has got a chance.
If we will do that, America's best days, and the world's finest hours, lie ahead.
Thank you very much.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-university-nebraska-kearney-nebraska
George W. Bush,"June 06, 2001",Press Briefing by National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice on President's Travel to Europe,"The James S. Brady Briefing Room
5:35 P.M. EDT
DR. RICE: Good evening, everyone. On Monday evening, June 11, the President will depart on a five-day trip to Europe that will take him to Spain, Belgium, Sweden, Poland, and Slovenia. The President will return on Saturday night, June 16th -- I might add, very late on Saturday night, June 16th.
The President's first official trip to Europe will express his vision of a Europe, whole, free and at peace, and it will include the following themes: NATO as an anchor of U.S. engagement; transatlantic security, and a force for stability and security throughout Europe; the U.S.-EU partnership for security and prosperity; the enlargement of the sphere of freedom, security and democracy. And the President also looks forward to his first meeting with President Putin and advancing an agenda for a constructive and realistic relationship with Russia.
I should note that this the first of two trips to Europe this summer. The G7-G8 meetings in Genoa in July will highlight the global dimension of our relationship with Europe. First, to the stop that we will make in Spain. The President will arrive in Spain on Tuesday morning, June 12th. While in Spain, the President will meet with King Carlos I and Queen Sophia. He will hold a bilateral and a lunch with Prime Minister Aznar and he will participate in a press availability at the Aznar ranch.
Spain is an appropriate place for the President to begin his trip. This country is an important NATO ally and trading partner, and a great example of successful post-authoritarian transition, and it is fast emerging as an influential European partner.
U.S. cooperation with Spain extends from the Mediterranean to Latin America. We have troops on the ground together in the Balkans, and we have important U.S. military installations in Spain. The President plans to cover a range of issues while there, including bilateral relations, trade issues, the Balkans, the Middle East, and European security including NATO enlargement.
The President spoke with Prime Minister Aznar early in February, and he, of course, received the King and Queen here in late March, and he looks very much forward to seeing them again in Madrid.
The President departs Spain Wednesday morning, June 13th, and goes on to Belgium. While in Belgium, the President will meet with NATO Secretary General Robertson, and with NATO leaders at NATO Headquarters. There he will have a press availability at NATO Headquarters. He will, afterwards, meet with King Albert II and Queen Paola. He will attend a U.S. Embassy greeting and hold a bilateral meeting with the Belgium Prime Minister.
During that part of the trip, the themes are that NATO embodies the transatlantic link that binds Europe and North America. It is based on common defense and security, as well as shared values and principles. The visit to NATO reaffirms the U.S. commitment to a strong alliance and to meeting new challenges together with our allies.
The President will discuss key NATO issues, adapting the Alliance to meet new challenges, defense capabilities, NATO enlargement, a new strategic framework for nuclear weapons, the European Security Defense Policy, missions in the Balkans, NATO outreach to Ukraine, Russia and --
The President is also looking forward to the bilateral component of the visit there. Belgium is a valued NATO ally and will hold the next EU presidency starting July 1. As I've said, the President will see the King and the Prime Minister there, and he will discuss U.S.-EU trade agenda, the broader U.S.-EU agenda, European security and also begin to preview with our European allies the question of AIDS in Africa, because that will undoubtedly be a major topic at the G-8 in July.
The President departs Belgium Thursday morning, June 1, and arrives -- I'm sorry, June 14th, and arrives on June 14th. While in Sweden, he will hold a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Perrson, attend a U.S.-EU summit and luncheon, participate in a press availability, meet with King Karl Gustaf and Queen Sylvia and have dinner with EU leaders.
The President's first U.S.-EU summit is a chance to advance his vision of a global partnership with the EU. The EU is already our largest economic partner, with an annual, two-way trade and investment profile of well over $1 trillion per year.
We're working well together to bring peace and stability to the Balkans and to integrate emerging democracies into Euro-Atlantic institutions. The summit is an opportunity to provide better definition and impetus to our common agenda with the EU, including the launch of a new trade round, addressing the scourge of contagious diseases like HIV-AIDS, exploring the different approaches to meeting our common goal of addressing climate change, and looking at Southeastern Europe and other regional security challenges.
The President will depart Sweden on Friday morning, June the 15th, and arrive in Poland. While in Poland, the President will hold bilateral meetings with the President and Prime Minister of Poland, lay wreaths at the Tomb of the Unknown, at the Warsaw Ghetto memorial, and at the Warsaw Uprising Memorial. He will deliver a speech at the university library and attend a state dinner, and of course, visit the U.S. Embassy in Poland.
Poland is a great success story of the post-communist era. It has built a stable democracy, a strong economy and a vibrant society. It's one of the three new allies in NATO, and the President will take the opportunity to celebrate that with the Poles while talking about this as just the beginning of a U.S.-Polish relationship that should benefit all of Europe and beyond.
The key security issues that the President will talk about there will be NATO enlargement, and he will talk also about our consultations on the new security framework. You may remember that Poland was one of the stops for the consultative team that went out a few weeks ago.
You should know that the President phoned President Kwasniewski early in his presidency, and he's stayed in close touch. And he appreciates the Polish government's tough economic reforms and will make that point to Prime Minister Buzek.
President departs Poland on Saturday morning and arrives in Slovenia. And while in Slovenia he will hold bilateral meetings with the Slovenian President Kuchan, and with the Prime Minister and, of course, he will meet there with President Putin of Russia.
But I want to make very clear that Ljubljana is not just the site of a meeting with the Russian President; it is in its own right an important stop for us, because the Slovenes have shown what a successful country in transition can achieve. It has been excellent on matters of economic reform. It is moving to an excellent political consolidation of its democracy, and the Slovene leadership seems to be determined to implement the necessary economic legal military reforms to become contributing members of EU and eventually of NATO.
The President looks forward to these meetings, and he also looks forward, of course, to meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin face to face. He will have an opportunity there to discuss with President Putin his vision for security in the 21st century and to explain to President Putin his desire to build a positive and constructive relationship with Russia.
The meeting is planned for a little over two hours between the two Presidents. We have a lot of work to do with the Russians, and the President is eager to begin it with President Putin. In addition to presenting his view on the nature of the relationship and its very important security component -- that is, to talk about the new security framework -- the President really wants to talk more broadly about the U.S.-Russian relationship, areas of cooperation, regional areas in which we are already cooperating, like Nagorno-Karabakh. Economic cooperation, and as well, areas with which we have differences with the Russians on proliferation, on Chechnya, on media freedoms in Russia.
But I want to be very clear that this will be an opportunity for the two men to get to know each other and an opportunity to sketch out a broad vision for the relationship. That is really the purpose of this meeting.
At the conclusion of the meeting with President Putin, the President returns here to Washington.
Q: What's the message the President's going to bring to allies who are critical of the administration's positions on global warming and missile defense?
DR. RICE: Well, first of all, the administration will bring to the allies another statement of our very strong interest in a strong alliance and strong Alliance relations. And as a part of that, we will understand that there will be times when we don't always agree on exactly what approaches to take to different problems. They will, I think, an important discussion of global climate change, a problem that the President takes very seriously, and he's looking forward to hearing from our friends and allies.
On missile defense, I think that I would not characterize it as disagreement. I would say that we're in the midst of ongoing consultations with our allies about how to best move forward to address the common threats of today's security environment. We understand that we're putting a lot on the table in talking about an entirely new security framework, a new comprehensive approach that includes a new offense-defense mix that puts offensive nuclear reductions on the table; that talks about new efforts at nonproliferation. We understand that there is a lot to digest here. The consultations have just begun and we look forward to talking with the Europeans.
But the one thing the President will really underscore is that we have more in common than we have in disagreement, and that we really should be celebrating that which we have in common.
Q: Just to follow up, besides listening to them on global warming, what is the message he's going to bring? ""I'm opposed to Kyoto, but"" --
DR. RICE: The President, as you know, because he was concerned about this issue, but has believed that the Kyoto Protocol did not address the issue properly, the President has had a high-level Cabinet working group that has been working very hard at this problem, but it's ongoing work. It is work that is continuing. A lot of ideas are being explored.
It has been a matter of bringing up to speed some of the highest-ranking people in this government. I would dare say -- dare challenge you to find a situation in which you've had so many high-ranking people sitting there week after week after week, understanding the challenge that we face in global climate change. Everybody from the Vice President, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Interior, Secretary of Agriculture. It has been quite something to see all of these people grappling with the issue.
The President has met with that group and he will have some ideas. But this is ongoing work and he really wants to talk about the seriousness of the problem and how we address it.
Q: Dr. Rice, is that to say, then, that whatever is announced, either prior to or during the course of the talks during the trip, will be more in line with I'm opposed to Kyoto, but these are principles that I adhere to and we're still talking about that before we come out with any specific ideas?
DR. RICE: Well, the President wants to keep this Cabinet-level working group continuing to work, because he feels that we have learned a great deal, that we have some good ideas, that we are getting a better sense for what the science does tell us and what the science does not tell us, and that ultimately, this is going to lead to better policy. But we are not through with the work, and we would be wrong to represent that we are through with the work.
This is a complex problem. It's a far more complex problem than one usually reads on the pages of the newspaper. And I think we understand its complexities. Addressing it is also a complex set of issues. So the President is going to keep this group working, and with his allies he'll talk a little bit about what we've learned thus far.
Q: You're not saying that the President is going to Europe with this buddy-buddy attitude when there's been so much hostility in the things that he's said. They don't really feel that he is on board with them or on the same page on Star Wars or everything else. So he's got a lot of fence-mending to do, doesn't he? I mean, the whole question of the whole missile defense, it doesn't work yet, and yet you're going to unveil it as our defense?
DR. RICE: Well, Helen, first of all, I want to say very clearly that the President is talking about a new strategic framework for dealing with threats of today, not the threats of yesterday. It is not 1972 --
Q: Right, but he doesn't have a system that works yet.
DR. RICE: It is not 1972. What we are embarking on and have told the allies that we wish to embark on is a comprehensive research-development, testing and evaluation program of many promising ideas. Some will accelerate; some will drop by the wayside. But this needs to be seen not just in the context of what we do about missile defense, but what we do about addressing the threats that are really there today.
This is not an era in which the Russians, pointing thousands of nuclear warheads at the United States on high stages of alert, with concerns about a Soviet conventional attack in Europe, is anything like the current situation. So the President is going to talk about the new security environment.
As to how he's received in Europe, I have sat in every meeting that he's had with European leaders. I've been there when he's made the telephone calls. These are friendly, respectful, outgoing relationships. And he's going to have a chance to renew them. The notion somehow that we have tremendous tensions with our European allies I think are, frankly, just not right.
Q: How can you say that? On global warming, on --
DR. RICE: Of course, we have policy differences on a number of issues. Not, by the way, on missile defense. There, the allies have made very clear that they appreciate the consultations that are going on, that they expect those consultations to continue. The NATO communique says that, yes, there are new threats to worry about. And so we have a lot of work to do with our allies, but, you know, the common values here, and the common agenda, far out-weighs policy differences that we have.
Q: The President is not going to be going to the Balkans, but do you expect him to make some statement about the pace or the prospect of withdrawal of U.S. troops?
DR. RICE: The President's been very clear that we are going to honor our commitments in the Balkans; that he understands that we went in together, that we will eventually come out together. What we have been talking to our allies about -- and I think everybody believes that this is appropriate -- is as conditions do change on the ground, what do we do about the troop presence, about the structure of our troops, and how do we get on with the business of building civilian institutions like police forces and a functioning judicial system that can actually be the bedrock of stable democracy in Bosnia-Hercegovina, or ultimately in Kosovo.
A lot has changed in the Balkans, including the election of a democratic government in Belgrade, and so we do have to keep assessing the circumstances. But the President has made very clear he has no deadline and that he's going to honor our commitments in the Balkans.
Q: Could you elaborate on what the President is going to be advancing or possibly proposing on AIDS? And could you also possibly react to a proposal today by Congressman Hyde, the Chairman of the International Relations Committee, which would put forward about a 50-percent increase in the funding for U.S. support for other countries dealing with HIV-AIDS?
DR. RICE: Outside of Africa? Essentially Africa, yes. I have not seen the Hyde proposal and, I'm sorry, so I can't really react to that. I know that Chairman Hyde has been very interested in this problem, and we've, indeed, talked about it. There's a lot of support on the Hill for doing something about the scourge of AIDS.
The President outlined his approach when he had Secretary General Annan here and President Obasanjo of Nigeria. And it is an approach that is comprehensive in the way we go about it. It recognizes that yes, treatment is an important issue, but so, too, is education and prevention; so, too, are health delivery systems that can actually carry out the rather complicated regimen that one needs to treat AIDS.
I think that perhaps Secretary General Kofi Annan said it best when he talked about the tremendous leadership that the United States had shown in being the first to respond to his call for a global fund to deal with infectious diseases like AIDS, tuberculosis and other such diseases.
The President will talk more about the need for accountability, for knowing what works, for having ways to measure the progress that we're getting. But most of all, I think he will join, hopefully, the allies in putting forth a real effort to deal with this scourge. And I might just want to note again, the United States already provides almost half of the funding internationally for AIDS. So it is a challenge, in a sense, to others to also come along.
Q: A question on the summit with the Russian President. Do I understand you correctly that no policy documents are expected to come out of that summit? And more generally, what outcome of the summit would you describe as a credible success to the Americans, to the Russians, and to the Europeans?
DR. RICE: I believe that the success of this summit is going to be seen in the long term. And that is that what we really are doing here is establishing a foundation with these two Presidents in their personal relationship that can help us to promote a constructive and realistic relationship with Russia going forward. No, we're not expecting major agreements here. This is, after all, a two-hour meeting of the two men. But we felt that it was time to go ahead and do this, to get them to start to get to know each other, to have them lay out a vision of how we see the relationship unfolding, and so I think that it will be successful, because I would speculate or I would guess that these two men will find that they have a lot in common in what they view as a successful U.S.-Russian relationship.
Of course, there will be disagreements. I know that it's sometimes better to write about the disagreements. But, you know, countries do disagree about some things. It doesn't mean that it's a fundamentally hostile relationship or that it's a relationship of enemies. Russia is a big power going through a major transition. I think the President wants to signal his support for having a Russia that is really a part of Europe, that is a respected partner in international politics, and they will talk about that as well.
Q: Dr. Rice, in diplomatic circles and in meetings with the President, how frequently do our European allies raise the issue of their governmental opposition to the death penalty? And do you see any possible awkwardness next week in the possibility that the U.S. will carry out the death penalty in a very high-profile case on the same day the President leaves for his trip to Europe?
DR. RICE: The death penalty has not been raised in a single meeting between the President and a head of state. I believe that our allies probably understand that this is a matter for the American government, its democratically-elected government with the American people to be concerned about. We are an open and democratic society, we have debates about the death penalty. Reasonable people disagree about the death penalty. But it is a matter for America's democracy, not a matter for international negotiation.
Q: With the 2002 target for the next round of NATO expansion coming up, do you expect that to come up in the discussions with the allies, and particularly with President Putin?
DR. RICE: I believe that it will certainly come up with the allies. It is, after all, NATO's business to decide when and where and how to take in new members. And so I suspect that there will be discussions there. It will probably also come up in the EU context because NATO and the EU are the two great European institutions and, of course, they have different profiles and different circumstances for entry. But obviously, in talking about the European Project, building a Europe whole and free and at peace, they both have their role to play. So I would expect it would come up there, too.
I think what the President will make clear in both those stops as well as when he talks to President Putin is that this really is a matter for NATO to decide. The United States believes strongly that enlargement needs to continue. It is only natural that enlargement will continue, that we believe strongly that there should be no red lines, geographic or historic, that eliminate any country as a fait accompli, and that we believe that there can be no veto by any country over NATO enlargement.
The final thing that he will make clear, though, is that anyone who wants to eventually become a member of NATO has to meet certain criteria. And there are membership action plans out with a number of states, and so fulfilling those is really very important.
Q: Going to Slovenia, does that indicate we believe Slovenia has met those standards?
DR. RICE: No. Nobody has been invited yet. Slovenia is a country that is making a lot of great strides. It seems to be a very good place to meet the Russian President and also to meet the Slovenes. Because frankly, in the Balkan story, Slovenia is a pretty remarkable success story.
Q: Dr. Rice, do you think -- first of all, were you accurately quoted in The Journal today about the administration's backing away from the Kyoto Accord? Do you believe that the administration could have better handled its withdrawal?
DR. RICE: What I think I said is that the President had made clear when he was a candidate that he did not believe the Kyoto Protocol addressed the problem of climate change in a way that the United States could support. He had the backing, by the way, of a Senate that was under no means prepared to ratify such an accord, and I think if you really look at the history of what was going on, nobody was ready to bring that treaty up for ratification because of the way that it was.
In retrospect, perhaps the fact that we understood that we had already said this was not immediately observable to everybody, and it might have been better to let people know again, in advance, including our allies, that we were not going to support the protocol. But as I said to European ambassadors, I was surprised that anyone was surprised.
Q: Dr. Rice, following up on this question, can you outline, at least at this date, what the President's principles are for a new Kyoto treaty or a new opening to discuss it? What are his principles?
DR. RICE: I think you will have an opportunity to hear this as well prepare for the European trip in one way or another. Let me say, the Cabinet-level working group is still working on what it wishes to say to the President before we go to Europe, and so I don't want to try to prefigure that. But the President's been clear about a few things.
First, he's been very clear that the problems with Kyoto could not be repeated in any further international effort. And so, one would want to be certain that developing countries were accounted for in some way, that technology and science really ought to be important parts of this answer, that we cannot do something that damages the American economy or other economies because growth is also important.
But it is also very clear that this is a President who takes extremely seriously what we do know about climate change, which is essentially that there is warming taking place. But he takes it seriously enough to also want to understand better what we don't know. It is the reason that he has worked very, very hard to put this Cabinet group together; that we've spent so much time understanding the science; that we've had experts in to help us understand what we do know and what we don't know, so that you can have intelligent policies that balance, given what we do and do not know about this problem.
Q: To follow up, in terms of timing, when would we expect, or when would the President -- Cabinet-level group? Maybe by G-8?
DR. RICE: Well, I think we don't want to set a time limit on it. It is working; it is continuing to work. I might note that even as this goes on, I think it will continue to work well into the future. I mean, one of the advantages of having this particular Cabinet group together is that you can look at the potential for agriculture and sequestration to play a role in dealing with emissions; that you can look at the effects on the economy as a whole, when you have both Larry Lindsey and Paul O'Neill sitting at the table; that you can look at concerns about energy supply when you have Spence Abraham at the table; and you can look at what we might want to do with our allies if you have Colin Powell there. So you could think of this as an ongoing way to address the problem.
Now, I think that there will be interim reports along the way, but we're taking this seriously enough that we're not just going to slap something together and say, okay, that's it. We think it's a problem that has many dimensions and deserves serious attention over an extended period of time.
Q: Dr. Rice, about the President's missile defense plan, Japan's new Foreign Minister has criticized the President's proposal, at least on several occasions. Are you disappointed? Are you willing to talk with him about the missile defense system?
DR. RICE: Well, of course, we're willing to talk with the Foreign Minister of Japan about the new strategic security framework. I must say that we've heard from the Japanese government that there is a willingness to listen and to continue to consult. Let me be very clear: We have not asked anybody to come out and say, oh yes, we woke up this morning and we think this is all a great idea to change the way that we think about nuclear weapons. That would be too much to expect. There's a lot on the table, and we're continuing to consult. And of course, we'll consult with the Japanese Foreign Minister as well.
Q: Dr. Rice, a question on some breaking news. Can you confirm that the U.S. will reopen negotiations with North Korea on a broad range of issues, including dealing with the troublesome issue of nuclear weapons?
DR. RICE: As you know, the Secretary of State is going to meet with the Korean Foreign Minister tomorrow. The President will issue a statement a little bit later tonight.
Q: Is that a confirmation?
DR. RICE: The President will issue a statement a little bit later tonight. You'll have to wait to see what it says.
Q: A question on the trip. How did you interpret the Secretary of State's ability to deal with the NATO foreign ministers on the question of missile defense? There was some language he specifically proposed that they did not endorse, and some of the communique changed what NATO had historically said about missile defense and about the ABM Treaty itself. What is your general assessment of what happened there and how does that set the table for this trip?
DR. RICE: I thought it was an enormously successful session for the Alliance. As a matter of fact, I think Lord Robertson went on the record to say that he believed that the characterization of what had happened in that meeting and the drafting of the communique was 180 degrees wrong, to paraphrase.
And it is true that for the first time, there is no mention of the ABM Treaty at all, let alone as a cornerstone of strategic stability. And so, you have to take that as a clear indication that the Alliance is moving on, that it understands that while there is a transition to be made, and while it understands that, and we understand that people believe that the treaty continues to be an issue, that people are listening when we say that the ABM Treaty can not only not be the cornerstone of strategic stability, but it is an impediment to getting to a new foundation for security in the modern era.
So I thought that -- I judge it as having been very successful, and it does lay the groundwork of continuing to move this ball forward. But I just want to emphasize, nobody expects breakthroughs on any given day, most especially so early in the process. We are early in the process of consultation.
Q: Dr. Rice, can I follow that? The reporting I've seen indicates that the language on the ABM was removed because we objected to it, and NATO being a consensus organization, it could not be included unless we went along with it. Is that inaccurate?
DR. RICE: I think that if you listen very hard to what Lord Robertson says, that Lord Robertson does not see this as having been the United States pitching a fit, and therefore getting some language that he wants.
Lord Robertson says that the reports that were out there about how the United States did not get language that it wanted, how this was all very contentious, he says this was respectful, this was a dialogue, and I think that that is exactly how this took place.
Now, all that I'm saying -- I've said that there are still people who believe in the importance of the ABM Treaty; nobody is -- we're not fooling ourselves in that regard. But in moving forward little by little -- and I would point you in this regard to the joint statements that were made with Prime Minister Blair, with Chancellor Schroeder, with the Japanese Prime Minister, with the South Korean President, all of which talk about a new offense-defense mix and working on the new threat environment -- this intellectual argument is moving forward and I think that we are at this stage very pleased in where we're going.
Q: Is it inaccurate, Dr. Rice, that a majority of the members of NATO wished to keep the language and the U.S. and perhaps Britain objected and, because -- and not in a contentious way, but simply because NATO is a consensus organization --
DR. RICE: I'm not going to give you a head count, but the United States was not alone in thinking that this was the right way to characterize the current situation.
Q: And his question on majority?
DR. RICE: Yes, all the way in back.
Q: Dr. Rice, you talk about -- you said earlier that countries -- people need to understand that countries do have their differences. But can you clarify one difference about the Bush administration, when the President's top trade negotiator, Bob Zoellick, said one day earlier, he said that it would be a constructive step if Taiwan's President can attend the APEC Summit, while today, the State Department seems to have said the opposite way, saying that Taiwan can only be represented by its senior economic official. Where does the President stand on this issue? Can Taiwan's president attend the APEC summit, or not?
DR. RICE: We have been very clear about the way that the President views the situation in the Taiwan Straits, including that we do not believe
in a change in the status quo unilaterally by either side, that we don't believe in any change by force. And I think you would find that Chen Shui-bian was treated with the kind of respect when he came to the United States that we think should be accorded to a democratically-elected leader.
But the matter of who attends the APEC summit, we don't expect any change in what has traditionally been U.S. policy at the APEC summit, which is the highest-ranking economic official.
MS. COUNTRYMAN: Last question.
Q: A question about Russia, please. This is your area.
DR. RICE: Listen, since I did this, I'll go there and there. How's that?
Q: Thank you. As you know, India approves the President's NMD, and you had spoken with the Defense Minister of India when he was here, and also you called him. But also, India is saying that China is a threat to the region as far as security and peace is concerned, because it's building up. Don't you think China is really a threat to the U.S. in the future? And if this is -- discussed between the two Presidents, also Afghanistan.
DR. RICE: We do not see -- we are not out to find a threat in the region. And what we are trying to do with China is to build a constructive relationship with China that would allow us to continue to support what is a very important fundamental transition that is going on in China. That is why the President has been so supportive of normal trade relations with China, of WTO accession for China, and a lot is going on in China domestically.
Now, it is true that we don't always see eye to eye with China about other matters, including security issues sometimes. In the Asia Pacific, for instance, we've made very clear to the Chinese that we're not leaving the region, that the United States is a stabilizing presence. But, for instance, on North Korea, there has not been tension with China.
So I think that it is by no means a picture of a threat. It is a China that has interests that are sometimes coincident with ours and sometimes not. It's true of normal relations between mature powers, and I think that we are working hard toward a constructive relationship with China that would benefit, obviously, peace and security in the Asia Pacific region.
Q: Dr. Rice, just to follow, are you going to discuss China and Afghanistan during the discussions?
DR. RICE: Well, with our allies, of course, we'll discuss any place on the globe that is of interest to them and I suspect that U.S.-China relations will come up. And most certainly, I would think that the problems that we have with the Taliban and Afghanistan will come up.
Q: Can you elaborate, Dr. Rice, on the vision that the President has for the future of U.S.-Russian relations? What does the United States want from them, this administration, other than acquiescence in the modification of the ABM Treaty? What does the President have to offer them in terms of incentives?
DR. RICE: Well, I think the greatest incentive for Russia to be a modern power that is internally reformed, democratic, economically open and marketable is that that would be the true source of Russian power for the future. And so it's not an incentive that we offer the Russians. It is that for Russia, that is the course for full acceptance and for being able to deal in the world in a way that is not a 19th century way of dealing with the world.
And I think that in some sense, Putin understands that. He understands that economic reforms do have to go forward. I am not always so certain on the democratic reform side. But obviously, the modern democratic state is the model that is succeeding. And so the incentive to Russia is to become the modern democratic state so that it can play its rightful role as a great power.
We in the United States have every reason to want that Russia to exist. We understand that it's mostly on the basis of choices that the Russians themselves will make, not choices that we will make. But of course, to the degree that a U.S.-Russian economic dialogue helps, to the degree that our support for Russian accession to the WTO when it meets the criteria helps with that process, we are prepared to offer that support.
We want to be supportive of the burgeoning civic society in Russia. I'm a university former provost and professor; I can tell you that one of the most important things that has happened since the collapse of the Soviet Union are the scores of Russian students that are studying in the United States, the easy exchange of peoples back and forth. That's an important part of the transformation that Russia is going to make.
And finally, the President will sit down, state to state, to talk about areas of potential cooperation on a new strategic security framework on regions of the world. We've cooperated in the Balkans; we've cooperated in the Nagorno-Karabakh. The Russians have been positive in the Middle East in these last -- since we have been in office. It is most certainly a broad relationship that we have with Russia. Russia is, after all, a big and important power. And it's not surprising, therefore, that it's a complex relationship. Some things we will agree on; some things we will disagree on. But there is no reason that Russia has to reemerge as a strategic adversary for the United States.
And that is really what the President is saying to President Putin. That is why he wants to move the security relationship on to a different footing, because this is now becoming a normal relationship with Russia, not the abnormal relationship that we had with the Soviet Union.
Thank you very much. Oh, I should mention, Dan Fried, who is the Special Assistant for Eurasian, will stay behind to answer any questions, on background, if you've got them.

George W. Bush,"June 14, 2001",Göteborg Statement: Summit of the United States of America and the European Union,"Today in Göteborg, we, the leaders of the United States and the European Union, reaffirm our historic partnership. Our relationship is founded on strong and enduring ties between our peoples and shared fundamental values, including respect for human rights and individual liberty, democratic government and economic freedoms.
What unites us far outweighs that which divides us. From this foundation, we are determined to forge a common and cooperative approach to the complex and changing global environment in which we live and the new challenges we face. Experience has taught us that, when the U.S. and EU work hand-in-hand, either bilaterally or multilaterally, we can be an engine for positive global change, nurturing the development of democratic regimes, opening trade and investment, working to reduce poverty, and protecting the environment.
Today's meeting takes place under conditions few of our ancestors could have imagined. The European-American bond of the last two generations has forged a great peace—rooted in democracy, free markets and human rights—that is our responsibility to preserve, deepen and extend. We renew our commitment to address in concert the most pressing bilateral, regional and global issues of the day.
Strengthening Our Transatlantic Bond
We are determined to strengthen our transatlantic bond. We agree that, for our partnership to be a stable platform for our common global agenda, we must address our differences honestly and seek, in good faith, constructive solutions. This we intend to do.
The U.S. and EU enjoy one of the deepest economic relationships in the world— the vast majority of trade and investment flows in an open, unfettered manner across the Atlantic. When this is not the case, we agree that consultation, rather than litigation, should be the preferred method of managing our disagreements. Moreover, we resolve to settle our trade disagreements more quickly and effectively. We are also determined to work together to explore ways to achieve this objective, including through mediation, and to redouble our efforts to find practical and mutually acceptable solutions to all outstanding trade disputes, in accordance with WTO rules. In this context, we welcome in particular the agreement to resolve the dispute on bananas. Furthermore, we reaffirm our determination to comply with recommendations of the WTO Dispute Settlement Body.
The EU is working to acquire a civilian and military crisis management capability, which will reinforce the Union's ability to contribute to international peace and security in accordance with the principles of the UN Charter and make the EU a stronger, more capable partner in deterring and managing crises, thereby also enhancing the security of the Transatlantic Community. The U.S. welcomes the efforts of the EU to strengthen its capabilities and to develop the ability to manage crises, including through military operations, where NATO as a whole is not engaged, and in a manner that is fully coordinated, where NATO interests are involved, and transparent with NATO, and that provides for the fullest possible participation of non-EU European allies. In particular, the commitments made by the EU Member States concerning military capabilities will, as they are implemented, strengthen both the EU and the European pillar of the Atlantic Alliance.
One of the unique aspects of our relationship is the development of transatlantic civil society dialogues. We will continue to benefit from their advice and perspective as we confront the challenges of the future. We encourage efforts to intensify the Transatlantic Legislators Dialogue between the European Parliament and the Congress of the United States, a dialogue which brings our peoples closer together.
Working to Promote Peace and Prosperity in Regions throughout the World
We remain committed to forging innovative solutions to resolve conflicts and will continue to promote peace, stability, democracy and economic renewal throughout the world.
We are gravely concerned by the developments in the Middle East. We welcome and support the report by the Sharm el-Sheikh Fact-Finding Committee. We urge both sides to implement the report's recommendations, in all aspects, including ending the violence, taking confidencebuilding measures and resuming negotiations. We welcome the constructive initiative taken by Egypt and Jordan to that end. We see no alternative to a negotiated solution based on UN Resolutions 242 and 338, and the principle of land for peace. We will continue to cooperate closely to promote peace in the region.
In recent months, we have strengthened our already close collaboration to bring peace, stability, democracy and economic renewal to South East Europe. We welcome the positive developments in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. In Bosnia-Herzegovina, we call upon all partners to contribute actively to the full implementation of the Dayton agreement, which remains the key element in building a lasting peace. In Kosovo, we welcome the promulgation of the constitutional framework for provisional self-government as a major step in building a peaceful, multi-ethnic and democratic society. We urge the people of Kosovo to condemn the use of violence and isolate extremists. In the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, we will continue to coordinate our efforts to promote a political solution to the current crisis. In this context, we support the political reform dialogue and look forward to a report in the coming days. In cooperation with NATO and OSCE, we have responded quickly and firmly to threats to peace in the region. Together, we are endeavoring to prevent extremism from undermining the democratic process and stress the need for political, not military, solutions.
We reaffirm our support for the Stability Pact for South East Europe. In order to encourage the countries of the region to promote democracy, the rule of law, protection of minorities, the inviolability of international borders and regional reconciliation and cooperation, we will continue to engage all States in the region through the Stability Pact and, in the case of the EU, also within the framework of the Stabilization and Association Process. Our objective will be to encourage political and economic reforms, among them those designed to enhance private sector investment in the region, in order to ensure long-term economic renewal. We urge all governments in the region to cooperate with the International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia in bringing war criminals to justice.
We fully support President Kim Dae-Jung's policy for peace and reconciliation on the Korean peninsula. We discussed the results of the EU high-level mission to the two Koreas and affirmed the importance of the DPRK leadership's adherence to its commitment to maintain the moratorium on missile tests and to continue the process initiated at the inter-Korean Summit We also discussed the U.S. decision to enter into a serious discussion with North Korea on a broad agenda, which was welcomed by the EU. We agree that the inter-Korean dialogue and cooperation, non-proliferation and human rights will remain issues of vital importance for further progress in developing our ties with the DPRK.
We recognize the progress made since 1991 and emphasize the importance to Europe, to the transatlantic community and the world of Russia's full transition into a democratic, free market state, enjoying constructive relations with its neighbors and close ties to the transatlantic community. We pledge to continue working together and with Russia towards that goal, and will pursue a dialogue with Russia that is constructive, cooperative and, where warranted, frank. We are concerned about recent adverse developments regarding media, which should remain independent and free of interference. We call upon the Russian Government to pursue actively a political settlement to the conflict in Chechnya.
The U.S. and EU strongly support an independent, sovereign Ukraine with close ties to the transatlantic community but are concerned about domestic developments affecting democratic and free market reforms. We support Ukraine's leaders in their pursuit of reforms that secure Ukraine's future prosperity and urge them to continue to follow this path. We remind Ukraine of the need to send a strong signal to the international community by responding positively and transparently to concerns over human rights, independent media and free elections.
We will intensify our political dialogue on the Southern Caucasus, where enhanced stability is a common interest. In that regard, the U.S. and EU remain committed to strengthening Georgia's sovereignty, independence, and transition to democracy and free market economy. We urge all sides in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict to continue their efforts to find a peaceful settlement based on mutual compromise.
Reaffirming Our Global Responsibilities and Commitments
We share a unique responsibility to confront issues of global concern and impact, and today we reiterated our commitment to address growing global challenges.
We are committed to launching an ambitious new round of multilateral trade negotiations at the WTO Ministerial Meeting in Doha, and, in our high level discussions in recent weeks, have made progress towards this shared goal. We seek a round that will lead both to the further liberalization of world trade and to clarifying, strengthening and extending WTO rules, so as to promote economic growth and equip the trading system to meet the challenges of globalization. The new round must equally address the needs and priorities of developing countries, demonstrate that the trading system can respond to the concerns of civil society, and promote sustainable development. We will work closely together and with our partners in the coming weeks to secure consensus to launch a round based on this substantive and forward looking agenda.
We also welcome the steady progress made so far on WTO implementation and are ready to examine ways to make further progress in connection with the launch of a new round of trade negotiations. We will also reinforce and improve our provision of technical assistance to build capacity, including capacity to support negotiations, in developing countries, so as to aid both their implementation of WTO agreements and help them to integrate more fully into the trading system, including the dispute settlement mechanism. Finally, we will continue to make efforts to secure the early accession of candidate countries to the WTO, with particular attention to the specific situation of least developed countries. This will make the WTO a truly universal organization.
Recalling that the dispute settlement mechanism of the WTO is a central element in providing security and predictability to the multilateral trading system, the U.S. and EU undertake to work constructively to improve that mechanism.
We agree on the need for an integrated and comprehensive approach to confront the diseases HIV/Aids, Malaria and Tuberculosis, particularly in Africa, emphasizing prevention in a continuum of treatment and care, and spurring research and development. We support the establishment of a global fund to fight these diseases. We are also working together to ensure the success of upcoming events, such as the UN General Assembly Special Session on HIV/ AIDS in promoting an effective global response to this scourge. We welcome the steps taken by the pharmaceutical industry to make drugs more affordable. In the context of the new global fund, we will work with the pharmaceutical industry and with affected countries to facilitate the broadest possible provision of drugs in an affordable and medically effective manner.
We celebrate the important contributions migrants have made to our countries. Respect for the individual right to seek asylum is also an essential democratic value of our societies. Therefore, we underline the importance of a comprehensive and integrated approach to asylum and migration based on a common commitment to human rights, existing international agreements, and support for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. We will focus on a broad range of issues related to asylum, illegal immigration and mass influxes of refugees and displaced persons.
We emphasize the need to take mutually reinforcing action in response to common problems in fighting international crime. We have, therefore, launched multi-annual cooperation in several areas, such as trafficking in human beings, cybercrime and crime related to drugs.
We had an interesting and open dialogue here in Go¨teborg on climate change, which will continue. We recognize that climate change is a pressing issue that requires a global solution. The U.S. and the EU are both committed to providing strong leadership on climate change. Prompt, effective and sustainable action is needed, consistent with the ultimate objective of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) of stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. We are determined to meet our national commitments and our obligations under the UNFCCC through a variety of flexible means, drawing on the power of markets and technology. In this context, we agree on the importance of intensifying cooperation on climate-related science and research. We disagree on the Kyoto Protocol and its ratification, but we are determined to work together in all relevant fora to address climate change and will participate constructively in the resumed COP 6 in Bonn. Our efforts must ultimately result in an outcome that protects the environment and ensures economic growth compatible with our shared objective of sustainable development for present and future generations.
Looking to the Future
We have also taken a fresh look at the mechanisms of U.S.-EU cooperation in the context of the changing global environment. Whether working together to resolve disagreements, promote peace among our neighbors or combat threats to the broader world, we seek greater results. To focus our attention and efforts on elements in our common agenda where progress is both necessary and possible, we have selected the following strategic themes for cooperation over the next several years, keeping in mind the need for flexibility in responding to unforeseen events. Within these themes, we have identified immediate priorities on which we seek tangible progress before our next Summit.
Addressing security challenges: Preventing conflict and managing crises; fighting terrorism; promoting non-proliferation;
Promoting Growth and a Multilateral Trading System: Reaching agreement on the scope of the new round and working together to solicit support for the agreement in the run-up to the WTO Ministerial in Doha;
Fighting Crime: Cooperating in fighting trafficking in human beings, drugs and cybercrime;
Protecting the Environment: Promoting effective ways to address climate change;
Fighting against poverty in the developing countries: Combating the communicable diseases HIV/Aids, Malaria and Tuberculosis.
Promoting the Digital Economy and making its benefits available to all citizens will be an important strategic theme for our dialogue for the years to come.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/goteborg-statement-summit-the-united-states-america-and-the-european-union
George W. Bush,"June 16, 2001",Press Briefing by Secretary of State Colin Powell and National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice,"Hotel Korsk
Brdo Pri Kranju, Slovenia
6:30 P.M. (L)
SECRETARY POWELL: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Dr. Rice and I are pleased to be with you, to spend a few moments answering your questions.
I just might begin by saying that I believe today's meeting between President Bush and President Putin was a fitting capstone to the Week of Europe, as we call it in the National Security Council and State Department, where President Bush had a chance to travel widely across the continent, beginning in Spain, where we reinforced the bilateral relationship that we have with Spain; continuing on to NATO, where he had the opportunity at the North Atlantic council for the first time to meet with all his fellow heads in government -- government and state of NATO, and to explain his thoughts with respect to America's continuing role in Europe, to emphasize the fact that we went into the Balkans together and we will come out together; to have an opportunity to express his ideas on a strategic framework for the future -- a future that is quite different than the past we have come out of, as we have come out of the Cold War era.
And then on to Goteborg, where he had a chance to meet with members of the European Union, and they had frank discussions with respect to global climate change. And then on down to Warsaw, where in a remarkable day yesterday we saw an outpouring of affection and support, not just for the President, but for Polish-U.S. relations. And I think the President gave a landmark speech yesterday, with respect to our belief in the future of Europe and the fact that we seek no enemies and there are no enemies, in our view, any longer, behind what used to be the Iron Curtain.
And then, finally, here today, where these two gentlemen had the chance to take the measure of each other, to express their hopes and aspirations concerning the future of the relationship between Russia and the United States.
So I think it's been an excellent week and I'm glad it ended in this very, very fine way, here in Slovenia. And let me express our appreciation to the authorities, the leaders here in Slovenia for the hospitality they've extended to us.
The meeting was about an hour and 40 minutes, just the two of them, with interpreters and note-takers. And Dr. Rice was a note-taker, so she has much more information and insight as to the meeting than I did -- or, I do -- I was in a separate meeting with Foreign Minister Inanov, and then we assembled, all of us, in a final short plenary meeting of about 15 minutes.
With that, I would invite your questions and Dr. Rice and I will field them, depending on the nature of the question.
Q: Mr. Secretary, your career was spent, as you've noted, in a time of blue lines and red lines on the map. I wonder if you could tell us what kind of a moment it was for you when Putin read that 1954 directive, and what it said to you about the prospects for future NATO-Russia cooperation?
SECRETARY POWELL: Well, I think there is every opportunity for future NATO-Russia cooperation. I did spend most of my life looking at the red side of the map from the blue side of the map, separated by an Iron Curtain. But some years ago, I had Dr. Rice's job, and I watched that whole thing disappear. And I watched the world become a mosaic of changing colors and parts.
And now I am so pleased to be the Secretary of State as I see that change continue, and I look forward to a productive relationship with Russia. There is no reason, as both Presidents noted, that we cannot be friends, that we cannot be partners, that we cannot cooperate in a number of different spheres, that we can't help each other move forward into the 21st century.
So as an old soldier, I was deeply moved by not only the activities of today, the meetings of today, but everything I have seen this week. I have been this week in places that used to just be on my target list in the old days. And now they are part of a free Europe, a Europe founded on democratic principles and values, and I'm pleased that I'm still around to be a part of it.
Q: Sir, can you tell us, when do you intend to start your consultations with Mr. Ivanov on the new security framework, and this will include missile defense?
SECRETARY POWELL: We'll begin rather quickly. Foreign Minister Ivanov and I will have overall responsibility for it, but there will be parts underneath that where the Defense Department will be our lead agency working directly with their ministry of defense. And Dr. Rice and I will set up our committees in consultation with Minister Ivanov and Minister Ivanov, and I would hope to see these consultations begin as quickly as possible.
So we're anxious to move ahead. And Foreign Minister Ivanov and I talked about it again today. I don't have a specific date for you.
Q: Mr. Secretary, to paraphrase President Putin, he said the 1972 ABM Treaty lies at the center, or the cornerstone, in his words, of the modern architecture of arms control. Can you give us a sense -- we had a pretty good sense before this meeting -- how wide the gap was between the two countries on that issue? Did it narrow any significantly today, and how do you go from here?
SECRETARY POWELL: I think I may ask Dr. Rice to talk to this, because she was in the room. But I think both sides laid out their position. I don't share President Putin's view that it remains at the center of the entire arms control structure or the entire strategic framework that exists between our two nations.
It was a treaty that was written for the time of the red and the blue map of 30-odd years ago, and I think it is quite appropriate, in light of a new world, in light of changed circumstances, to review anything that is from that era to see if it is still relevant, and why not talk about changing it.
It was interesting that President Putin made that point, but he also said, now let's get into a dialogue to see what it is that we think should be updated. So at the same time that he held his position, he also invited dialogue.
Q: Dr. Rice, if you would expand on that, please?
DR. RICE: Yes. I would also say that there was a great deal of interest on the Russian side and the question of new and common threats, and I think a desire to explore that further. As you know, President Putin has said publicly several times that he believes that there are new threats, and that was expressed again today in the meeting with the President.
He also said in his press conference, a new security architecture. And so I think we'll have serious consultations, discussions about what constitutes now that new security architecture. But I think there is an openness to dialogue, there is an openness to discussion, and I felt that they established a very good basis to move forward.
Q: On that dialogue, did the gap close any in the differences of opinion on the ABM Treaty and its centrality?
DR. RICE: Well, as the Secretary said, they had an hour and 40 minutes together, and then an additional 15 minutes. But they covered a wide variety of subjects. It would be a mistake to think that even the bulk of this conversation was about missile defense or the ABM Treaty; it was not. It was about a whole wide range of issues. This was one small part of the discussion, and they did not try, as the President said, to get into a negotiating session about trying to close the gap.
But I think it is also important to note that they gave experts -- both the Secretaries of the Foreign Ministry and State and the Defense Secretaries -- a desire to go now and talk about concrete issues.
Q: Dr. Rice and Secretary Powell, during the campaign, Bush seemed to be very skeptical about Russia, especially compared to the Clinton administration, and critical of the way the Clinton administration tended to personalize relations between the countries, and embodied in their two leaders.
It seemed today that we were witnessing a personalization of diplomacy in a way that maybe you criticized in the past. I'm wondering, I mean, they seem to have had a very warm meeting, they talked about how they trusted each other. How do you look at that now? And, also, any other atmospherics for those magazine writers in the room that you could provide would be great.
DR. RICE: Doing the work for all of you, all right? (Laughter.)
On the issue of personalization, no one has ever said that it's not a good thing for the President of Russia and the President of the United States to have a good, warm relationship, to be able to look each other in the eye and to expect each other to be straightforward. That was never the issue.
The issue was whether or not the United States started to equate reform with Boris Yeltsin. And I think you heard something very important, actually, from President Putin that I don't remember hearing earlier in the history of U.S.-Russian relations, because he took full responsibility for creating conditions in Russia in which economic capital would begin to flow to Russia.
He talked about the work that Russia had to do. And I think that the United States can clearly try to be a partner; the United States can be supportive; we can send the Secretary of Commerce and Treasury and trade representatives and support Russia in WTO accession when it is ready. But we cannot do the Russian's work for them. And I think that was the tone of this meeting.
This President has been very clear that he wants a good relationship with President Putin, but that he's going to be realistic both about those things about which we agree and those things about which we disagree. And he did so, the two of them, in an atmosphere that was respectful and, frankly, quite straightforward.
Q: Did you hear in anything President Putin said or as what we're seeing emerges, the possibility that there could be some kind of agreement and embrace of the ABM that would allow us to do what we want and would allow them to have the sort of reassurances that they seem to --
DR. RICE: Well, Frank, as I said, they only talked about this issue for a period of time with the President kind of allaying out a vision. But I do believe that they are open to discussions and I believe that both the Secretary and I have said to you that we are open to discussions about what constitutes the new security framework.
We are quite convinced that it's time for the world to move on, pass the ABM Treaty, to deal with the new threats, to deal with offensive reductions, defensive forces that can contribute to deterrence and new nonproliferation efforts. And, by the way, they did spend a good deal of time on nonproliferation issues.
And so we believe that there is a new security framework to be had. Its form is really up for discussion. And I think they set in course a very high level set of discussions to get that done.
Q: I'm wondering what kind of talk there was between the two Presidents on actually reducing nuclear arsenals?
DR. RICE: Again, they did not talk in specifics. The President laid out the framework that you have heard him lay out. President Putin listened, said that he looked forward to further discussions. But they didn't get into details.
Q: Did they agree on the basic idea that it was important to reduce nuclear arsenals on a general level?
DR. RICE: Well, I think we have known for some time that the Russian Federation feels strongly that nuclear reductions are in its interest, and the President has made clear that he believes that getting to a level that is consistent with our deterrent needs is important to us. So I don't think that there was anything there to bridge.
Q: Dr. Rice, Mr. Secretary, when President Putin said today that he agreed with President Bush that the U.S. and Russia can be good allies, is that meant, allies in the sense that the members of NATO are allies?
SECRETARY POWELL: Let's call it small ""a."" I think he was talking in terms of a partnership, friends, countries that could get together, that have mutual and shared interests, that can work together. I don't think he was talking about an alliance in the sense of a military alliance or a political alliance.
Q: Are you ruling that out?
SECRETARY POWELL: I'm not ruling anything in or our at the moment.
Q: Can I ask you to elaborate on your answer to Jay's question on the atmospherics? For example, who's idea was it to take a walk in the woods? Did the President enter the meeting intending to invite him to Crawford or did that just develop? I mean, what were the atmospherics?
DR. RICE: The President had said -- really it wasn't planned hours in advance. The President said, I would like to invite him to come to Washington, and I think on the spot then President Putin invited the President to come to Russia. It was a quite remarkable meeting in that it was both warm and straightforward. Sometimes meetings are warm because people are trying to blur differences. This was not the case. This was a case in which I think President Putin feels he had his say, in which President Bush felt that he had his say, but they maintained a kind of warmth about it, a kind of respect about it.
And, frankly, I think both men, I think, connected on a kind of sense of humor. The President mentioned the point about the daughters being named after mother-in-laws. That was kind of an interesting moment. But it was really not a very scripted meeting. It was a meeting in which the exchanges were long. There was a lot of dialogue between them on every issue. They went into depth on some issues; others, they left to their experts to do.
But it really was one of the more remarkable meetings of this kind that I've been in, because it was extremely straightforward. They did not blur their differences. The President brought up freedom of the press. The President brought up Chechnya. Mr. Putin brought up concerns that he had about the region to his south. They did not try to blur their differences, but it was still a very warm meeting.
Q: In his speech in Warsaw yesterday, the President seemed to put the United States' weight behind full membership of NATO. Did President Putin understand that speech in that way, and what was his general response to the possibility of the Balkan states coming into it?
DR. RICE: The President, in his speech in Poland, I think simply laid out some important principles, which were that he believes NATO should continue to expand. He and the allies, as Lord Robertson said, believe that something should happen at Prague. There cannot be a zero option at Prague. The President also clearly said that there should be no geographic and historical red-lines, and that no one has a veto. He did not bother -- he did not need to reiterate that to President Putin. President Putin had read the speech, he understood that.
But the President did reiterate that there was nothing for Russia to fear with Europe moving toward it, that this is an alliance of democracies and peace-loving states, and that he looked forward to a relationship that completely took cognizance of Russia's European-ness in much the way that he talked about in Poland. But President Putin did not comment directly on specific areas, specific questions that the President had raised -- or specific points that the President had made in Poland.
We'll miss the plane if we don't get out of here.
THE PRESS: Thank you.

George W. Bush,"June 16, 2001",The President's News Conference With President Vladimir Putin of Russia in Kranj,"President Bush. Good afternoon. President Putin and I have just concluded 2 hours of straightforward and productive meetings. We had a good discussion of our views of Russian-American relations and of the changing world at the beginnings of this new century. Our countries have common interests, and we share great responsibilities.
My meeting with President Putin today is an important step in building a constructive, respectful relationship with Russia, a relationship that has the potential to benefit not only our two countries but also the world. Russia is an important country with vast potential. When Russia and the United States work together in a constructive way, we can make the world a safer and more prosperous place.
I enjoyed the opportunity to meet President Putin in person for the first time. I am convinced that he and I can build a relationship of mutual respect and candor. And I'm convinced that it's important for the world that we do so.
More than a decade after the cold war ended, it is time to move beyond suspicion and toward straight talk, beyond mutually assured destruction and toward mutually earned respect. As we work together to address the world as it is, not as it used to be, it is important that we not only talk differently; we also must act differently.
We have great opportunities to cooperate on economic, commercial, regional, and security issues. President Putin and I have agreed to launch an extensive dialog about a wide range of issues that we can constructively address together.
We also discussed the importance of sound investment climate to improve Russia's future economic prosperity. I was so impressed that he was able to simplify his tax code in Russia with a flat tax. I'm not so sure I'll have the same success with our Congress.
We must continue a dialog, so I'm prepared to send both Secretary O'Neill and Secretary Evans to Moscow soon to further our discussions. I want to encourage Russian and American businesses to become more involved in our discussions, so that together, we can foster meaningful investments. President Putin agrees with this approach.
And we've agreed to launch regular detailed and serious consultations on the nature of our security relationship. I said to President Putin that we need a new approach for a new era, an approach that protects both our peoples and strengthens deterrence by exploring and developing our new attitudes toward defenses and missile defenses. I've directed Secretary of State Powell and Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld to work with their Russian counterparts to begin discussing a new security framework. I have invited President Putin to Washington this fall; he accepted. He invited me to Russia, and I accepted, and I look forward to the visit.
We also agreed to continue our cooperation and work toward common solutions on important regional issues, from the Balkans to Nagorno-Karabakh to Afghanistan. And we discussed our common interest in developing the energy resources of the Caspian Basin in a way that benefits all the countries of the region.
Respectful relations require honesty. And we did discuss areas where my country has differences with Russia, over Chechnya and over media relations. I also expressed my hope that Russia will develop constructive relations with its neighbors, like Georgia, that are trying to find their own way in a challenging but hopeful world.
This was a very good meeting. And I look forward to my next meeting with President Putin in July. I very much enjoyed our time together. He's an honest, straightforward man who loves his country. He loves his family. We share a lot of values. I view him as a remarkable leader. I believe his leadership will serve Russia well. Russia and America have the opportunity to accomplish much together; we should seize it. And today we have begun.
And finally, I'm especially pleased we're able to have this meeting in Slovenia, one of the success stories of Southeast Europe. In my meetings today with the President and the Prime Minister, I reaffirmed America's support for Slovenia's integration with Europe and the Euro-Atlantic community. I especially thank the people of Slovenia, and I want to thank the leadership for such warm hospitality and congratulate the people on the 10th anniversary of its independence on June the 25th.
I only regret not staying long enough to see Lake Bled or to climb Mount Triglav. Who knows, maybe I'll have the opportunity down the road.
Mr. President.
President Putin. First of all, I wanted to confirm everything that's been said by President Bush when he characterized our meeting. I could even add that I was counting on an open, frank dialog, confidential dialog. But in this regard, as they say in cases like this, reality was a lot bigger than expectations, because this was not only a confidential discussion but extremely and all the way to more than what you could expect from frankness, because President Bush, as a person who has studied history, proposed a very global, wide-scale approach and view to history. And it was very interesting and positive.
We sat, talked about the past, about the present, about the future of our countries and about the development of the situation in the world for many years into the future. This was really a very interesting discussion. I think that we found a good basis to start building on our cooperation. We're counting on a pragmatic relationship between Russia and the United States. We compared our approaches in key areas, and once again, we established our common ground.
I want to return now to what the President said very recently, that Russia and the United States are not enemies, they do not threaten each other, and they could be fully good allies. And taking into account the fact that the United States and the Russian Federation—as no one else, as no other country of the world—have accumulated huge amounts of nuclear weapons, weapons of mass destruction, we bear a special responsibility for maintaining the common peace and security in the world, for building a new architecture of security in the world.
All of this presupposes a very close cooperation for strengthening security in the 21st century. And saying this, any unilateral actions can only make more complicated various problems and issues.
One of the central topics of our discussion was the strengthening of strategic stability. We exchanged our views on our approaches. It was very important for me to hear how and what the President of the United States thinks and to hear directly from him.
In turn, naturally, I expressed the approaches of Russia in this sphere. The differences in approaches do exist, and naturally, in one short moment, it's impossible to overcome all of them. But I am convinced that ahead of us we have a constructive dialog and the will to talk about these topics, to discuss, to hear, to listen—to listen and to hear each other. And to my mind, this is very important.
The President and I have agreed that we're going to tell our Ministers of Defense, Secretaries of Defense, Foreign Ministers, to continue in this vein, to continue this discussion without any pauses.
Of course, we discussed some very difficult regional issues, the Near East and Afghanistan and the Balkans. I have to say that this discussion showed that the differences in our approaches in the very fundamental areas are much less than that which unites us. The differences in our positions, positions of the two countries, really are not of a fundamental nature, a global nature, something which cannot be solved—not at all. I think that it would be very incorrect for us to start forcing out issues and arguments and not take into account the very fundamental, main concepts and issues in our relationships, which are the basis and the whole foundation of the relationship between the Russian Federation and the United States of America.
The President and I are united in saying that the economic ties between our two countries do not correspond to the potential of our two countries. The Government of the Russian Federation, businessmen of both countries, and the U.S. administration, of course, can do a lot more to support the effectiveness of our economic ties. And the President expressed that we need an additional impulse from our businessmen, that we will do everything possible to receive a very high-level business delegation of the United States to Russia, moreover, especially if it is headed by one of the senior officials of the U.S. administration.
Here there are a lot of very specific issues. We talked about energy resources; we talked about using the Caspian Basin. You know, very soon the new pipeline system is going to go into effect, which is going to be transporting energy resources from the Caspian region through novie russkies. And this is a joint project of two companies, Russian and American companies. I'm sure that this will not be the last such project.
I want to stress here that the issues that were discussed at Ljubljana are going to be the subject of our continuing dialog. And we really, in fact, did agree that we're going to talk in Genoa; we're going to talk in Shanghai at the APEC Conference. And I'm very grateful to the President of the United States for inviting me to the United States. I would do it with great pleasure, especially because he invited to have me over at his ranch. And I'm going to receive him in my own home, not just in Russia but in my own home.
And the last, in the last few months, and at the very threshold of our meeting, there was a lot of discussion about the fact that U.S.-Russian relations are overburdened by problems and issues that are somehow reaching a critical stage. I think the very nature and the result of our discussion today between myself and the President of the United States will put an end to all of these rumors. We see very clearly a very positive prospect of our relationship in the future. And we are all geared up to work in the future constructively, pragmatically, and to establish very good, predictable relationship.
And of course, I cannot but say the very highest about the hospitality of our hosts, who provided us with all the conditions necessary for holding this very good meeting—good, moral atmosphere.
Thank you. Thank you ever so much.
Moderator. Dear colleagues, we have said that we're going to give the first opportunity to ask a question to journalists from Slovenia, please.
[At this point, a question was asked, and an English translation was not provided.]
President Bush. I don't think the interpreter could have done it in English, but anyway, go ahead.
NATO Enlargement
Q. On the next summit in Prague, where, according to Lord Robertson, enlargement will happen, and what is the Russian position on enlargement?
President Bush. I went to my first NATO summit, and there appears to be a uniform desire to expand NATO. This is certainly the position of my country. But as I reminded the leaders today, that there is a process, and the countries must work toward that process. I am impressed by the progress being made in this country, and we will take that under consideration when we meet in Prague a year from this fall.
The Balkans
Q. A question for you, Mr. Putin. You're leaving from Slovenia, straight to Belgrade. Do you have any concrete solutions for the Balkan crisis?
President Putin. As I understand you, what you have in mind is the situation in the region.
Yes, it's working. It's working. It's good to have dealings with effective people that make things work.
As I understand it, what you have in mind is the overall situation in the Balkans, right? Macedonia, Kosovo, et cetera, right? Well, we do have our own idea, vision of what's happening here and how we should act.
Today we did discuss with the President of the United States, Mr. Bush. The most important things that we have to really pay attention to is to put an effective block, an end to any kind of extremism and feelings of intolerance—religious intolerance. People who are trying to solve, no matter how complex an issue of national or ethnic or religious conflict—weapons simply are not those kinds of things which can solve these problems.
In some of the countries of the former Soviet Union, for instance—you probably know, we talk about this very often—in the Baltic States, for instance, we feel that human rights are damaged, especially of the ethnic Russian populations. In Latvia, for instance, 40 percent of the population is Russian-speaking, a huge number of noncitizens—in other words, people who can't even get citizenship. We don't send weapons there. We don't support those people. We don't call it terrorism. We don't try to get people to rise up on the basis of national or ethnic origin or religious feelings. We don't encourage people to take up arms to fight against that.
I stress against, and I insist that people who try to do this do not deserve the support of the international community. But on the contrary, the international community must say once and for all, everybody who does this will receive due answer. These things can only be solved through negotiations. This is a very difficult process. It requires patience, but there is no other way.
National Missile Defense/Nuclear Proliferation
Q. A question to both of you, if I may. President Putin, President Bush has said that he's going to go forward with his missile defense plans basically with or without your blessing. Are you unyielding in your opposition to his missile defense plan? Is there anything you can do to stop it?
And to President Bush, did President Putin ease your concern at all about the spread of nuclear technologies by Russia, and is this a man that Americans can trust?
President Bush. Yes. Do you want to go first?
President Putin. Now, as far as the issue of antimissile defense, the official position of the Russian Government is known. I don't think we need to spend time to, yet again, declare it. We proceed from the idea that the 1972 ABM Treaty is the cornerstone of the modern architecture of international security. We proceed from the premise that there are elements which unite us with our partners in the United States.
When we hear about things like concerns of the future and about threats from the future, we do agree that together, we have to sit down and have a good think about this. But we proceed from the idea that these concerns and threats are different kinds of things. Threats have to be defined. We have to look at where they come from and then make some decisions as to how we have to counter them.
We feel that we can do it best together. Based upon today's dialog, I've come to the conclusion, and the impression, that we might have a very constructive development here in this arena; at least the President of the United States listened carefully. He listens to our arguments very carefully. But I think the specialists, as I have said before, have to sit down, have contact to identify the overall platform that we're going to work from, and try to find a way together to solve these problems.
Now, as far as the issues of proliferation and nonproliferation, I have to say that in our opinion, this is a topic that's very, very closely tied to the ABM Treaty because many other things are hooked onto this same string. And many threshold states, when it comes to the destruction of a previous accord, can only be happy and say, ""Look, fantastic. Yesterday, we were threshold. Nobody agreed—nobody took any account of us—now, today, recognize us."" This is a problem we're going to have to really think very hard about.
Can we trust Russia? I'm not going to answer to that. I could ask the very same question.
President Bush. I found him to be very straightforward and trustworthy. We had a very good dialog. I was able to get a sense of his soul, a man deeply committed to his country and the best interests of his country. And I appreciated so very much the frank dialog. There was no kind of diplomatic chitchat, trying to throw each other off balance. There was a straightforward dialog. And that's the beginning of a very constructive relationship. I wouldn't have invited him to my ranch if I didn't trust him. [Laughter]
Secondly, I appreciate the opportunity to be able to talk about a new relationship, and we will continue these dialogs. The basis for my discussion began with this simple premise, that Russia and the United States must establish a new relationship beyond that of the old cold war mentality. The cold war said loud and clear that we're opponents and that we bring the peace through the ability for each of us to destroy each other. Friends don't destroy each other. People who cooperate do not have a basis of peace on destruction.
Our nations are confronted with new threats in the 21st century. Terror in the hands of what we call rogue nations is a threat. I expressed my concern—and so did the President—very openly, about nations on his border and nations that can't stand America's freedoms developing the capacity to hold each of us hostage; and he agreed. I brought up concerns about Iran. And I'm hesitant to put words in the President's mouth, but he said he's concerned, as well—I think that accurately categorizes your position—and we'll work together to stop the spread of weapons of mass destruction. And I believe as we go down the road that we'll be able to develop a constructive relationship as to how to use our technologies and research and willingness to keep the peace, in a way that makes the world more peaceful.
I was so pleased that we were able to begin constructive, real dialog between our Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld and Mr. Andrei Ivanov. These will be fruitful discussions, and I believe what people will see is a strategy, a joint strategy. The President's a history major, and so am I. And we remember the old history. It's time to write new history, in a positive and constructive way.
NATO Expansion
Q. This is a question to both Presidents, if you allow. Mr. Bush, you partially answered—you talked about issues of strategic security; you talked about the future. In this connection, could you tell us anything about what you talked about the expansion of NATO? Thank you.
President Bush. [Inaudible]—to expand, so long as nations met their obligations and fulfilled their—met what's called the MAP process. I said yesterday in Poland, I felt like a secure border for Russia, a border with safe and friendly nations, is positive. And I expressed my Government's position very plainly. And the President, of course, had a reaction, which I'm sure he'll give you right now.
I thought he was going to give it to you right now. [Laughter]
President Putin. Yes, I'm going to lay it out for you. I'm going to lay it out for you. Look, I'm going to read to you something which was recently declassified. Speaking for myself—look, this was printed a while back, but there's a document—attached addendum documents which were secret. ""Copy declassified""—it was top secret. Look, here it is. This is a note of the Soviet Government from 1954, sent to the countries of NATO. Here's what it says: ""The leadership, holding to its inalienable policy and taking into account all the tensions, the Soviet Government announces its intention to enter into discussions with NATO countries about its participation in NATO, with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.""
And this was the answer—look, here's the answer: The Soviet Government proposed—they were talking about the widening of the NATO pact and what they're going to do about bringing the Soviet Union in. ""There is no need to stress the completely unrealistic nature of such a proposal from the Soviet Union."" That's the answer that NATO gave.
So what we're talking about here, you remember about a year ago, I think, somebody asked a question about, ""What's your attitude? Is it possible that Russia is going to join in NATO or not?"" I said, ""Why not?"" And right away, Mrs. Albright, former Secretary of State—she was someplace on a trip to Europe—she said, ""Look, we're not talking about this right now.""
Look, you understand that our attitude toward NATO is not was one toward an enemy organization; of course not. And I'm very grateful to the President of the United States that finally, from the territory of the United States, these words were heard. This is very important for us; we value this. When a President of a great power says that he wants to see Russia as a partner and maybe even as an ally, this is worth so much to us.
But if that's the case, then, look, we ask ourselves a question: Look, this is a military organization? Yes, it's military. They don't want us there? They don't want us there. It's moving towards our border? Yes, it's moving towards our border. Why?
So this is the foundation of all our concerns, not just to bring it in or not bring it in, or accept NATO or not accept NATO. Look, the positive feeling that we now have developed today with President Bush—this could be a separate subject of discussion because, you know, Russia is cooperating with NATO. We have an agreement; we have association; we have various accords and treaties; there's the JPC. And there's no need to fire up this whole situation.
National Missile Defense/Russia-U.S. Relations
Q. Mr. President, did you offer President Putin any inducements in this conversation to ease his opposition to a U.S. missile defense plan?
And President Putin, to follow up on your comments just now, does the simple fact of President Bush saying that Russia is not an enemy actually change your strategic or military planning?
President Bush. I offered something: logic and a hopeful tomorrow. I offered the opportunity, which the President is going to seize, for us, as leaders of great powers, to work together.
We have a unique opportunity to address the true threats of the 21st century together. We have a great moment during our tenures to cast aside the suspicions and doubts that used to plague our nations. And I'm committed to do so.
I said in Poland, and I'll say it again: Russia is not the enemy of the United States. As a matter of fact, after our meeting today, I'm convinced it can be a strong partner and friend, more so than people could imagine.
The leader of Russia is working hard on behalf of his people to promote prosperity and peace. And I believe our nations can work together to achieve prosperity and peace, not only within our respective countries but around the world. I believe that.
And so we didn't have a bargaining session. We had a session of two men who have come to office for the right purpose, not only to represent our countries but given our standing, our respective standings, to work together to deal with the threats of the 21st century. A threat of the 21st century is energy; a threat of the 21st century is poverty; a threat of the 21st century is the spread of weapons of mass destruction. And as the President said to me clearly, he said that ""You're not the only nation that cares about weapons of mass destruction; we care."" And we have an opportunity to do that. We have an opportunity to reject extremists that could threaten our respective nations and respect our— and threaten our alliances. And we will do so—we will do so.
And today has been a very constructive day. Everybody is trying to read body language. Mark me down as very pleased with the progress and the frank discussion. We will meet again in July, then later in the fall. Then we'll have the great Crawford, Texas, summit. And I believe that people who watch carefully our relationship will see that it grows and emerges. It starts with trust. Ron [Ron Fournier, Associated Press] asked a great question: Can I trust him? And I can. And from that basis we can begin a very fruitful relationship.
Q. So there were no specific—that you offered in this meeting, just logic?
President Bush. We did not—well, first of all, our relationship is larger than just security relationships. It's bigger than figuring out how to deal with the ABM Treaty; it's much bigger than that. It deals with two leaders who share values.
The President told me something very interesting. He said, ""I read where you named your daughters after your mother and your mother-in-law."" And I said, ""Yes, I'm a great diplomat, aren't I?"" [Laughter] And he said, ""I did the same thing."" [Laughter] I said, ""Mr. President, you're a fine diplomat, as well."" We share our love for our families. We've got common interests. And from that basis we will seize the moment to make a difference in the world. That's why he ran for the Presidency, and it's why I ran for the Presidency.
This is not a bargaining session. The President didn't say, ""You know, if you do this, I'll do that."" It's bigger than that. It's a bigger relationship than that, and it's important to understand that.
Q. Question on whether the simple fact of President Bush saying that you are no longer—the United States is not your enemy actually changes your military thinking or your strategic thinking and planning?
President Putin. This is not a question; I think this has become an interview. [Laughter] But look, nonetheless, I'll respond. It's not by accident that I said that's it's important for us. And it seems to me that if you start with a mutual understanding that we are partners, that's the way we're going to move to try to solve this very important issue.
Look, we didn't just sit down and say that our specialists are going to meet and they're going to have an exchange of views. But we agreed that they're going to discuss very specific questions which cause concern to both sides, very specific items. I'm not prepared right now to get into this publicly, but we're talking about specifics.
Moreover, I have to say that between Russia and the United States, we have two protocols that we've signed on nonstrategic ABM systems, in New York and I think it was in Helsinki. And this, too, is a subject of very special review. I think the specialists should define all these things. Again, I define—I repeat—define the threats and those things which just stand in the way; to look at the power that both countries have to neutralize these threats. I think we can work out a common approach.
Russia-U.S. Economic Ties
Q. To both Presidents, if you allow: Getting back to trade and economic issues, ties between our two countries, how soon do you think we can expect a delegation of American businessmen to Moscow? And do you have any plans on creating an intergovernmental commission of various agencies, which could stimulate economic ties between the United States and Russia? Thank you.
President Bush. I'll talk to the Secretary of Commerce as soon as I get back and tell him of our agreement and get him moving. Sometimes I worry a little bit about commissions. If commissions exist just to exist, then I don't think it's fruitful. If commissions exist in order to stimulate action, then perhaps.
Let me say one other area where the United States is in agreement with Russia. We think Russia ought to be admitted into the World Trade Organization. And we'll work toward that end. The Russian President has expressed a desire to join the WTO, and I think it makes sense. I think that will help a lot.
And there's a lot of areas in our business relationships. I reminded the President that oftentimes people speak in terms of—they say Russia is a country of great resources, only referring to the energy resources, the mining resources, the timber resources. That's true. But Russia has got a resource that's invaluable in this new era, and that's brainpower. Russia's got great mathematicians and engineers who can just as easily participate in the high-tech world as American engineers and American mathematicians. And that's an area of great interest to me, and it's an area of great interest to the President. It's an area where we can begin a fruitful dialog.
The deployment of capital is something that's very important to Russia; it's important to our businessmen. The President understands it's important to have rule of law, a reasonable tax system, transparency in the economy. And he's working toward that, and I am grateful. Our businessmen and our Secretary of Commerce will hear that when they travel to Russia.
President Putin. You know, I agree with the President in that to overload our relationship by a variety of bureaucratic structures and organizations, that's not always justified. The most important thing is to create favorable conditions for effective work by the business community. We know the plans of President Bush with respect to his taxation policy and with respect to other measures which he is planning, with respect to the economy of the United States.
From our part, we still have to do so much that would make Russia attractive for foreign investors—although among international investors, the Americans are in first place. Naturally, first and foremost, we have to take care of the issues of the energy problem in the world at large. American business is showing a great interest in this sphere.
But we also know that President Bush has plans in the atomic energy field. Here, too, we think we've got a couple of things we could talk about. We have a very fruitful area of cooperation we could work in. We have a number of various structures that are working very appropriately now in reprocessing uranium.
We've got pretty good cooperation in space now. It seems to me that to a significant extent, that which exists now, it is functioning very successfully now, the space station, the International Space Station and the participation of the United States and Russia.
We have so many other areas we'd like to work in. But when the businessmen come—that depends, of course, on the U.S. side—but we'll receive them at any time that's appropriate to them.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-president-vladimir-putin-russia-kranj
George W. Bush,"July 22, 2001","Press Briefing by Dr. Rice Discussing the Bilateral Meeting of President Bush and Russian President Putin in Genoa, Italy","En Route Cristoforo Colombo AirportGenoa, Italy
3:27 P.M. (L)
MR. FLEISCHER: Does anybody have any questions?
Q: Yes, when they talked about joining forces, to work together in regional conflicts, do you know which in particular they think they can, and what joint forces means?
DR. RICE: Well, they used as an example what they've been able to do with the French, in NK, in Nagorno-Karabakh. And it doesn't mean military forces, it means joining diplomatic efforts. I think that Colin Powell believes, for instance, that Igor Ivanov has been very helpful in the Middle East. And obviously we're cooperating in the Balkans, which is another area. So those are the areas that I think that they really meant, and those are the areas they discussed in most detail.
Q: How did the Russians help in the Middle East?
DR. RICE: There have been several meetings between Arafat and Putin, Arafat and Igor Ivanov. Powell very often, when he's arranging the diplomacy he will call Annan, he'll call Solana and he'll call Igor Ivanov. And the idea is to get everybody giving the same message to Arafat. There have also been a couple of meetings with Sharon with the Russians. And obviously there are connections there, given the large Russian population. So I think they've actually been quite helpful.
Q: What about these discussions that you're going to go on, to see - so you're going to go and set up discussions between Ministers of Defense and Foreign Ministers. And then do you have any sort of timetable on when you hope things start rolling or getting a decision on any kind of cuts?
DR. RICE: Well, I think the important thing is that the schedule of consultations, is how I would describe it, we would hope to have completed by the time that I leave Moscow. And I think you'll see that they'd be very regular, because they talked about an intensive schedule of consultations.
I don't think that either president has in mind a timetable at the other end, in other words, you have to do it by this date. But they clearly want to make this quite intensive, and want to get going very soon. So it's my job to go get that schedule put together.
Q: Are they closer now to settling - are they further down the road now than they were after the Slovenia meeting? Did they make any progress today that's measurable?
DR. RICE: Well, I think that I'd just point you to the line in the joint statement that they already have some tangible areas of agreement. I think that they are making some progress on what the elements of a new strategic framework might entail, including discussions of defensive systems, although there's not yet agreement as to what form that would take, given the constraints of the ABM Treaty. But also that offensive reductions are a part of it, the non-proliferation efforts are a part of it, that discussions on terrorism are a part of it. So I think that what they've really moved forward on is what are the elements of a new strategic framework, and I think also, a kind of openness to the fact that a new strategic framework is a good idea.
Q: Where are they on the terrorism part of the talks?
DR. RICE: At this point, the discussion is to have under probably Deputy Secretary Armitage some discussions on terrorism -- on efforts to combat terrorism. The President always makes the point that in fact missile defense is one part of a counter-terrorism strategy, because you would be denying to countries that might try to use ballistic missiles in a terroristic way the capability to do that. But I think these will be pretty broad discussions. Right now it's just a commitment in principle.
Q: President Putin seemed very excited about the idea of linking offensive weapons to defensive weapons. Did the President bring that up first? What's your sense of that agreement? How does that work, because people may remember Reykjavik, where SDI was tied to - what's your sense of that?
DR. RICE: No, I think that there's something quite different in mind here, and in fact it was the President who first linked these, all the way back in his pre-election speech, but then at the Fort McNair speech he made very careful - very clear that he thinks these are all part of a package of elements of a new strategic framework. So again, I thought there was movement forward in hearing the Russian President say, all right, this has to be about defense and offense, not just as they tended to want to talk about offenses in the past.
Q: Going into this meeting, though, was it sort of reiterated, and said - that he brought up in this meeting, or was it something that you were - that Putin brought to this?
DR. RICE: They had been talking, and it was actually Putin who said that he thought it would be good to say that they were about to discuss this, and they decided then on a joint statement.
Q: Who was it that decided today? You guys hadn't already thought we'll have a statement?
DR. RICE: No, this came out in the meeting.
Q: Dr. Rice, after the first bilateral, in Slovenia, President Bush said that he looked into Mr. Putin's eyes and saw that he could trust him. And later on, he annotated that a little bit to say trust and verify. If you trust someone, why would you need to verify?
DR. RICE: Well, I don't think he - I think what the President said was, he - first of all, he is somebody that takes people at face value unless they give him reason not to. And he said that he thought that there was a basis here for a candid and honest and straightforward relationship. And I think that the meeting today did nothing but reinforce that.
Because I want to emphasize that they don't sit there and sugarcoat for each other sensitive issues. The President brought up the problem of freedom of the press. He brought it up in the small meeting and also in the expanded meeting. They talked about their differences on Iraq. They talked about Iran. I think you're going to see here a maturing relationship.
And a maturing relationship is one in which you do not simply talk about what you agree about, and try to make the other side feel good, but it's really a relationship in which you can, in a friendly way, still talk about difficult things. And I think that's what the President was expressing at Ljubjana, and I think that that was certainly the character of the meeting today, as well.
Q: Did they talk about the smart sanctions vote in the U.N.? And did President Putin give any expanded reasoning for why he thwarted us there?
DR. RICE: Well, the President did raise his disappointment that we were unable to come to agreement on Iraq, and that Russia was in fact the isolated party here. And President Putin said that he shared the goal of trying to make sure that Saddam Hussein would not be a threat to his neighbors or to his people again, but that they disagreed with the methodology here. The President listened to him. They agreed that the two foreign ministers would go back and hash it out.
But I think the President is very clear that he believes the United States and Britain have the right approach here. And it's going to be a matter of continuing to talk to the Russians about it. But there was no acrimony about it. But the President was very clear that he was disappointed that we were unable to get to an agreement on Iraq.
Q: When you talked about going to Russia yourself, and setting up this timetable and the schedule of intensive consultations, are you talking just logistically setting dates, or also setting agendas, and what does that step-by-step unfolding look like, even just topic wise?
DR. RICE: Well, I'm also going, in addition to setting up dates and logistics, as you say, to listen to the Russians on what they have in mind for these consultations, so that we have a sense of how they see the agenda unfolding. I don't think that we're going to say on August 1 we have to discuss X, and on August 7 we have to discuss Y. I don't think it will be like that. But I do think that we want to get a good sense of the topics and subject matter that both sides want to put on the table as we go forward.
And I want to emphasize that these are ministerial level consultations. This is not a set of 15 year arms control agreements -- arms control discussions. This is at the ministerial level, and we expect to move quickly.
Q: When do you actually leave?
DR. RICE: I leave from Rome, the day after tomorrow. I'm sorry, from Kosovo, the day after tomorrow.
Q: Will the schedule you set be consistent with the very loose time table you and Powell and others have set out, in terms of dealing with the issues relating to the ABM Treaty and missile testing of months, not years, in that short period of time? Are you talking about setting an aggressive schedule that would allow you to get to the brunt of those issues in the next few months?
DR. RICE: It clearly will be an aggressive schedule. And I think both Presidents want it to be an aggressive schedule, allowing for the fact that these are busy people, these ministers. And so one has to allow for that. But they clearly want an aggressive schedule. We don't have a specific timetable in mind. We've made very clear that the constraints of the treaty are a problem for us, and that the President really believes that he's going to need to move forward at an appropriate time. But I think right now what we're focused on is getting in motion high-level consultations, to see how quickly we might be able to sketch out an agreement.
Q: Back on the subject of linkage, what's your feeling, is it that there would be a linkage of nuclear arms reduction to just breaking the treaty, or that the arms reduction in nuclear forces would be a part in deploying an actual system?
DR. RICE: I wouldn't call it linkage. I think the better term is the one that's in the statement, which is that they're inter-related. And the reason that they're inter-related is that it's not that the offensive systems need to be maintained at a certain level to overwhelm the defensive systems, which was the thinking back in the Cold War days. Because the President has made very clear that this is a limited defense system, against several nuclear weapons, not against hundreds of nuclear weapons.
The way that they're related is that they are both elements of a new way of security, which is lower levels of offensive forces on lower stages of alert, so that there's less danger of accident, or unauthorized release, missile defenses aimed at specific limited threats, and that we get out of a force structure that really came out of a time when we worried about a Soviet march across Europe that would lead then to nuclear war. So it's in that sense that they're linked, not that the defensive systems require a certain number of offensive systems.
Q: Or that a reduction in the offensive systems is a precursor for Russian agreement?
DR. RICE: Right, we see it as all part of the same package. And I think that the good thing about today's statement was that there is no sequencing here. This seemed to be a package.
Q: You know, President Putin yesterday indicated he wanted specific information and details on what the problems were with the ABM, and what you wanted to change. Did you go into much more detail today?
DR. RICE: The President explained to him, as he said in the past, that the problem with the ABM Treaty is that it was signed to prevent you from building ballistic missile defenses. I mean, whenever you have a treaty that in every other line says, if you test in an ABM mode, you're in violation of the treaty, you have a problem with the treaty when you start trying to build ballistic missile defenses.
We consistently said that we don't think the way to approach this is to line in, line out the treaty, where we say this test requires that change in the treaty, because the treaty is so restrictive. And our view is that we need to move beyond it. We need to get flexibility for a robust testing and evaluation system. A robust testing and evaluation program is going to run afoul of this treaty. There's just no doubt about that, because just to give you an example, everybody's favorite potential system is a sea-based system of some kind, because of its flexibility. And in fact it would clearly not threaten the Russian deterrent. You can't test a sea-based system in an ABM mode. There are just too many limitations.
So I think the President, certainly when Don Rumsfeld and Sergei Ivanov get together, I'm sure Don can show him where this test or that test is a problem. But the fact of the matter is, the ABM Treaty was intended to prevent the development and deployment of ballistic missile defenses. And we have to always keep that in mind.
Let me just say one other thing. You can get five lawyers to give you different interpretations of when you're violating this treaty. And I'm a veteran of the sozdavat' (phonetic) controversy. Did the Russian verb sozdavat' (phonetic) mean to develop, or did it mean to establish? We don't want to get into that. We really want to get to a place where we have flexibility to do the testing and evaluation we need to do.
Q: Just on that, is it fair to say then that Putin essentially was trying to see how to amend the ABM, and you're saying let's start something new all together?
DR. RICE: I think we've always said that we believe that the ABM Treaty is not only a problem for the limitations it places on testing and evaluation, but it's the wrong treaty for the wrong era. And it inculcates and hardens a hostile relationship that no longer exists. But we'll talk to the Russians as to form. I think that's part of the consultation that needs to go on.
Q: From where Putin is coming from, is he looking much more at amending?
DR. RICE: I don't want to put words in his mouth. He has not, to my knowledge, yet said what he has in mind. So we need to talk to him about it.
Q: How much of their talks today were focused on defense, ABM, things like that, and how much were on other issues?
DR. RICE: I'd say it was about half and half.
Q: And what was the biggest other issue?
DR. RICE: They talked a lot about economic issues and economic cooperation. They talked some, within that context, about the kind of political environment that produces economic benefit, including the ability of citizens to express themselves, and so forth. So there was some talk about the Russian internal transformation.
Q: So they did bring up Chechnya and bring up human rights - I mean, the rights of free press, and things like that?
DR. RICE: They did bring up -
Q: Dr. Rice, unless I misunderstood your briefing back at the White House a week or two ago, you said that you weren't interested in getting into another treaty that would put restrictions on defensive weapons. Is that still the view of the United States, that you're not interested in another treaty that would restrict defensive weapons? And if that's the case, then in what way are defensive weapons part of these talks? Simply as a carrot to be offered to the Russians, so that they would agree to an offensive - in an offensive framework or -
DR. RICE: I'm sorry, the other way around. Right. No, the - what we're not interested in doing is replicating the old arms control process, by which it takes us 15 years to come to some agreement. We believe that that is something that happens when you have an implacably hostile relationship. And so we don't believe there's a need for such.
As I've said, we will talk to the Russians about what forms they have in mind. But I would expect, or certainly it's our view that these are more like defense planning talks, that you look at what is required for each side to insure itself. And when you look at - we understand that the Russians may not even see exactly the same threats that we see, because they have a different history and a different geography. That's okay.
Q: Was there any progress at all - does the President feel there was any progress at all, or on the U.S. side, on the calls for economic reforms in Russia? I mean, you mentioned press freedom economic reforms was one of the other big-ticket items?
DR. RICE: I think that you'll find that they're going to try to engage this dialogue on press in a creative way, for instance. At one point, there was some talk about what is the economic basis of a free press. This is an interesting question, because Russia doesn't actually have an advertising culture for the press. And so do you want them to have state ownership of the press, or is it going to be corporate ownership of the press? Or how do you think about supporting a free press? I think that's a dialogue they're interested in having.
On the economic progress that they're making, nobody would disagree - nobody could say they don't have a long way to go still, but they're making some progress. There's a lot of legislation before the Duma. The flat-tax got passed, and I think everybody believes the tax system was one of the biggest problems that they faced. Implementation I think is going to be difficult, but I think it's impressive what they've done so far in that regard.
Thanks.

George W. Bush,"September 25, 2001",Press Briefing by Ari Fleischer,"The James S. Brady Briefing Room
12:50 P.M. EDT
MR. FLEISCHER: Good afternoon. Let me give you an update on the President's day-to-day, and then share some other information with you.
 The President, as many of you know, began his day with a meeting of the bipartisan congressional leadership. He met with Majority Leader Daschle, Speaker Hastert, Minority Leader Lott, Minority Leader Gephardt, to discuss the military planning, as well as to discuss domestic consequences.
 He had his intelligence briefing and a briefing with the FBI this morning, and then he convened a meeting of the National Security Council. He has just concluded a meeting with the Prime Minister of Japan, where they discussed ways the United States and Japan will cooperate in fighting against terrorism, and he will depart shortly for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, where he will thank the workers there for the role that they have been playing in the war on terrorism. And he will also receive a briefing on several aspects of the investigation.
 The President will also travel to Chicago on Thursday to meet with airline workers at O'Hare Airport. He will thank the workers for their contributions in combatting terrorism by working every day and getting our airline system and our economy back on track to help keep our economy moving and to help to keep the American public moving.
 The President will also talk about the importance of the government and the airlines working together to address important issues of airline and airport safety. He'll address airline workers' concerns about these difficult times and the impact it's having on airline workers and their families.
 Following his meeting with the airline workers, the President will also have lunch with Mayor Daley. That's on Thursday.
 I want to share with you some new information, also, out of the Department of Education about assistance, and the Department of Treasury. From Education, Secretary Paige announced today that the U.S. Department of Education will provide $5 million in immediate assistance from his Rehabilitative Services Administration to New York State to help those who have suffered disabling and mental and physical injuries as a result of the terrorist attacks.
 The Secretary also announced a $1.7-million grant to New York from the Department's Project Serve to meet the needs of New York's school districts whose students and teachers were directly affected by the attacks. That grant is in addition to the $4-million grant that had previously been announced.
 And the Secretary announced that the Department is sending a team of mental health experts specializing in trauma and disaster response to meet with key staff of the New York City Board of Education to create a plan to help the city's students and teachers in the aftermath of the attacks.
 And now, over to Treasury. These are follow-on announcements to yesterday's announcement by the President in the Rose Garden. Secretary O'Neill participated today in a conference call with G7 finance ministers during which they discussed the economic and financial situation in the G7 countries and their common cause in strengthening the international fight against the financing of terrorism.
 And the Secretary and the finance ministers have issued a joint statement just moments ago in which they agreed to integrate action plans developed since the attacks, and pursue a comprehensive strategy to disrupt terrorist funding around the world. They also agreed to meet in the United States in early October to review the economic developments, which is a very encouraging sign that, again, the world is joining the United States, shoulder to shoulder, to fight this war against terrorism on multiple fronts, including the financial one.
 With that, I'm more than happy to take questions. Campbell.
 Q:Ari, the President said this morning that we're ""not into nation-building,"" but at the same time he's made it abundantly clear the Taliban is a target. So what is the administration's plan with regard to the power vacuum that's likely to result if we take out the Taliban?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, again, the President said that we have respect for the Afghani people. I remind you that the Taliban regime is not comprised entirely -- it's comprised substantially of non-Afghanis who came into Afghanistan for the purpose of sponsoring terror and bringing it to the rest of the world. So the President's message is that we will take actions designed to protect the people of the United States and protect the people around the world from terrorism, and that we will take action, including military action, against those who harbor terrorists.
 It is not designed to replace one regime with another regime. Part of the process also will be being mindful of stability in the region throughout the process. But it is not nation-building, but that's not to say that the Taliban will be given a free pass because they can encourage terrorism, harbor terrorism, and then because we have to worry about issues involving instability, won't take action. The President has made clear we will.
 Q:But if he says we're not into nation-building, ultimately you're going to have a situation when this is over that you have to deal with. Or is it your view that it's someone else's problem, other countries in the region should deal with it? Or is there -- Northern Alliance --
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, I think you're presuming in your question that whatever action the United States takes, and the world takes, that the situation in Afghanistan will be worse. And that's not a presumption that I think you can make.
 Q:Maybe because of the deliberate ambiguity of the President's comments, but I took it another way, which is that he was saying today that the government, our government is not after the removal of the Taliban as a precondition of achieving its objectives, that in fact, he'd work with any of the citizens of Afghanistan, he said, who would be willing not to support terrorism. Does it represent a less aggressive posture toward the regime in Afghanistan than he articulated in his list of demands last Thursday?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I think you need to look at it exactly as the President described it, which is that anybody who harbors terrorism will be the target of our operations and the target of our actions. And within the Taliban, they have to decide what to do. And clearly, they are, at least from what we're hearing, making their choice that they will continue to harbor terrorists. But we will take whatever action is necessary, with an eye always on stability, to protect people from terrorism that is sponsored by the Taliban.
 Q:But if there are officials within the Taliban, dissident officials, in Kabul as opposed to Kandahar, for example, who are willing to meet our demands, that's okay? We aren't looking, as you point out, to replace one regime with another, we just want to --
 MR. FLEISCHER: The issue is not to what regime do you belong, but what actions have you taken in sponsoring or harboring terrorism. If you are sponsoring or harboring terrorism, you will be a target for American action and for world action.
 Q:Don't you think that the United States ought to have an answer at the end of the road? If they do come along with us, this will happen, and so forth. You were saying, we're assuming it will be worse. We're not assuming anything. We want to know where you're headed.
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, that's why I answered Campbell's question by saying that stability is always an objective.
 Q:And this is -- you know, during World War II many promises were made, Atlantic Charter and so forth, to people who would help us, allies and so forth, North Africa, that they would find freedom at the end of the road, and so forth. And we are offering nothing, publicly.
 MR. FLEISCHER: What we are not doing is turning a blind eye to anybody who would sponsor or harbor terrorism.
 Q:All we're offering is destruction.
 MR. FLEISCHER: We're offering protection.
 Q:Ari, can I just follow? Isn't it fair to say the President said that the Taliban is an -- I think he used the word incredibly repressive regime. Does he believe that the Afghanistan population would be better off without it?
 MR. FLEISCHER: You know, again, there's no question the Taliban is a repressive regime. Women have no rights. It's just by all definitions of the free world and other world a repressive regime. But again, the fundamental mission that the President is focused on is going after, through a variety of means, those people who sponsor or harbor terrorists. The stability of the region is also an important issue, which is going to, of course, be a part of all the planning that goes into what is done.
 But it will not stop the United States or any other nations from taking action against those who have carried out this attack on the United States.
 Q:Where is the carrot?
 Q:Isn't it fair, though, to say that there has to be discussions going on within the administration and with allies about possible steps, whether it be a UN protectorate or something set up in the case of removal of the Taliban? I mean, isn't it fair to say there has to be some discussion of that?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Again, you're assuming the objective here is to remove a regime. The objective here is to target those who have sponsored or have gone after or harbored the terrorists. And that will take a variety of forms.
 Q:Ari, if our support for the Northern Alliance is not to overthrow the Taliban, is it then to try to occupy more areas of Afghanistan and remove the effective amount of territory that bin Laden can operate in?
 MR. FLEISCHER: The United States is going to work with a variety of people, including Pakistan and, of course, as you know, Russia and others, involving putting the coalition together.
 Your question on the Northern Alliance specifically is --
 Q:If our support of the Northern Alliance is not to remove the Taliban from power, is it then to encourage the Northern Alliance and help them occupy more areas of Afghanistan to remove the effective areas that bin Laden can operate out of?
 MR. FLEISCHER: The United States welcomes the efforts of the Northern Alliance and anybody else to put an end to those who sponsor terrorism to fight those who sponsor terrorism.
 Q:But have we stated to the Alliance that we want their help in fighting terrorism, but don't go -- don't march on Kabul?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I'm not going to be more explicit than that. We're not, as you know, indicating exactly what actions we're asking of different people or nations around the world.
 Q:Ari, can I put aside the issue of what we or our allies might do, but was I wrong when I heard that the President say that the Afghan people have this repressive regime, many would like to be rid of it -- but was I wrong in hearing him really calling for the overthrow of the Taliban?
 MR. FLEISCHER: The President has made it clear, and Condoleezza Rice said on one of the Sunday shows that the people of Afghanistan would clearly be better off with a different regime. But the whole purpose of this exercise is that the Taliban should not be given an excuse because there could be other issues that follow after their support for terrorism is diminished or put an end to.
 There should be no question around the world that our actions are going to be aimed at protecting citizens around the world from the Taliban's actions to sponsor terrorism.
 Q:Even if our explicit goal is not regime change or nation-building, the President would be delighted if the Afghan people did that job for us?
 MR. FLEISCHER: The Afghani people are not synonymous with the Taliban. They are different. And the Taliban, to a significant degree has come in from the outside, from other nations, from different regions of the world, and they've taken advantage of the turmoil that has existed in Afghanistan and the lack of a powerful central government in Afghanistan to make Afghanistan the breeding ground for their international terrorism.
 So there is a difference between the Afghani people and the Taliban.
 Q:If I just heard the statement you said, we would support any elements within Afghanistan who are willing to put -- that anybody --
 MR. FLEISCHER: End terrorism in Afghanistan. We'll work with them.
 Q:Ari, President Putin last night, when he spoke on Russian TV, made it clear that the degree of Russian participation in the campaign against terrorism would depend on what he called greater understanding for what the Russians are trying to do in Chechnya. Is he going to get that greater understanding from the United States?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, the position of the United States is enshrined as an important principle in fighting for human rights everywhere around the world. And it will continue to be America's position. Russia, too, has terrorist threats that it is addressing. And the United States at all times will remind all nations around the world, as they deal with any threats, that human rights must always be a policy objective.
 Q:Could you state for the record what this government's current view is of the war in Chechnya?
 MR. FLEISCHER: The United States government's view about the war in Chechnya is one that we are reminding the Russians about the need to adhere to important human rights, to respect the various nationalist movements, and to do so in a way that is consistent with the UN charter and human rights.
 Q:So, Ari, are you saying that with Russia and other nations who might be offering money or assistance to us, you'll not give up on this desire to have human rights be at the top of the agenda? You won't let that kind of slide for a little while in order to get their support?
 MR. FLEISCHER: You know, I think if you take a look around the world, at all the actions that over time our American military and our nation has been called on, human rights has always been at the forefront of it. It's true in the manner in which the United States military conducts its operation and the manner in which any type of harm to civilians has always tried to be kept to the absolute, absolute minimum. And that message is an internal American message to all nations around the world.
 Q:On the economic front, you mentioned earlier today that the administration is looking at both industry-specific problems and the big picture. Is it possible that we'll see another bailout similar to what you've done for the airline industry, for some other industry?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Ron, I think it's too soon to say. The focus remains on having taken action to help the one industry that was principally adversely affected as a result of an order by the United States government to put all its planes on the ground, and therefore, deny itself the ability to carry out its business for a period of several days, the United States moved quickly to help the airline industry.
 No such immediate action was taken that had a direct impact on any other industry. The President is working with members of Congress very closely on any potential next package that would help the economy in general. There could be different elements of that package that bring different amounts of help to different people, depending on their circumstances. But that's under review right now and there's no specific indications that I can give you about what it will look like.
 Q:To ask about the Taliban here, at what point did the President's strategists or advisors differentiate between the Afghan people and the Taliban? And are you saying that the United States is content to let the Taliban fall in upon itself and not make any sort of value judgment about who will replace that leadership?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, the distinction has always been made, and the best example I can give you is the United States provides approximately $140 million a year in assistance, humanitarian assistance, to help feed the people of Afghanistan, while at the same time the United States has never recognized the Taliban regime as a legitimate government. So that's the existing policy and it's a wise one.
 So all the actions that the President and his staff have been undertaking since September 11th have kept that distinction in mind.
 Q:Ari, and the second part of that question?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Give it to me again.
 Q:Is the United States content to let the Taliban fall down upon itself to create pressure that will cause it to fall apart on its own, without making a value judgment about who replaces that leadership?
 MR. FLEISCHER: The United States has made it clear about the conditions for actions that must be taken on the ground in Afghanistan, involving turning over Osama bin Laden, his top lieutenants to the proper authorities, shutting down and closing all the terrorist facilities, allowing United States access to make certain that they're shut down. Those are the conditions and they need to be met.
 Q:On the Hill, Ari, you've had Greenspan and Rubin meeting yesterday on the House side, today on the Senate side, talking about economic stimulus. To what extent is the White House involved in this, and what does the White House view on the need for any stimulus in general, and on the efficacy of any particular actions that might be taken?
 MR. FLEISCHER: That's why I indicated the administration is working very closely with members of Congress about what type of economic action could be taken to help as far as a stimulus for the economy.
 One of the interesting developments out of some of these meetings on the Hill involving Chairman Greenspan was the Chairman's statement that it's very important for Congress to pass trade promotion authority. He believes that in the wake of the attack on the United States it's now more important than ever for the United States to have that authority. That's been reported by a senator up on the Hill this morning; it's the senator's attribution of what Mr. Greenspan said.
 And the President shares that view. The President does believe it's important for Congress to take action on trade promotion authority and do so this fall as another way to help the economic and to help protect, to create jobs in America.
 Q:Has the administration reached a view that it is necessary, in fact, to have another stimulus program, a package of things to stimulate the economy, beyond what is already in place?
 MR. FLEISCHER: It remains under review.
 Q:Ari, isn't the President concerned that an issue like that, if it comes up for a vote in the House, will be divisive and harm this unity that he's fostered on the Hill?
 MR. FLEISCHER: No, I think the President wants to do it in a way that reaches out. Clearly, trade promotion authority cannot be agreed to unless it is bipartisan. You have a Republican House and a Democratic Senate, so by definition, anything that moves in the Congress will move with bipartisan support.
 Q:A recent Bloomberg news poll shows that while a majority of Americans support war, they don't support using the Social Security Trust Fund to pay for it. What is the administration's position on this? Isn't it kind of clear that you would need to dip into this money?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Let me make a couple of points. One is, I read that story; it surely seemed to me, at least by the person who was quoted in the story, is that he was under the impression that the choice was lose his Social Security check or pay for a war, which clearly is not the case. The existence of the Social Security surplus has nothing to do with the ability of the government to pay all benefits to retirees now and for the long-term future. So I think there was a wording issue in that poll.
 But even having said that, the President is not going to be governed by whatever the polls show. And I think the President recognizes that -- he's appreciative of the very strong support he has from the American people. I don't think anybody believes a 90-percent rating is going to last forever. But the President is going to continue to do what he thinks is right for the country and protect the country and to take whatever actions are necessary in accordance with his previous statements about Social Security should not be used unless in times of war or recession. And clearly, we are in a time of war.
 Q:Is the President, when he meets with the airline workers on Thursday, going to have anything to offer beyond what he's already done for that industry, and the possibility that there might be additional stimulus?
 MR. FLEISCHER: We'll keep you posted if there are any policy developments to accompany that trip. Nothing I can report now.
 Q:But he's going to meet them. Is he simply going to feel their pain, or is he going to try and help them in some other way?
 MR. FLEISCHER: It's exactly what I indicated in my announcement of the trip. And if there are any other add-ons to it we'll let you know, we'll keep you posted.
 Q:Ari, do you know if the President has spoken directly with the exiled King of Afghanistan?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I have no information that says he has.
 Q:Ari, forgive me if this is answered by the Pentagon. In the letter the President sent yesterday about the deployment of combat-equipped troops to foreign nations in Central and Pacific Command, do we know what nations and what the criteria is, or are we not allowed to know?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I'll have to look into that. I don't know that specifically.
 Q:On airline security, the President said that Transportation Secretary Mineta, coming over this afternoon. So he's going to present options. Are we expecting the President to sign off on recommendations today?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, I think it depends on what the options are and what the discussion is. The President has asked his advisors to take a look at various issues affecting airline security and other matters like that. He's having a series of meetings; he'll likely have more. So I'll be in that meeting and if there's anything to report, I'll try to keep you posted.
 Q:As I understand, you know, Mineta has the task force. Is he presenting to the President the findings of the task force?  MR. FLEISCHER: Let the meeting take place, and I'll try to fill you in.
 Q:Can I just ask one other question? Sorry, John. In terms of one view of the President, does he support having federal workers, federal employees be the ones to screen baggage and luggage at airports?
 MR. FLEISCHER: That's under review. I think it's part of the whole package. The President wants to see the recommendations in their totality. John?
 Q:I was just going to ask that.
 MR. FLEISCHER: Okay.
 Q:The President this morning said that Labor Secretary Chao is developing recommendations to address displaced workers, but no consensus has been reached yet. Can you elaborate on what the differences are? Is this dealing with what sectors should be assisted, or how to assist displaced workers?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, of course here you get into the differences in the government about who has direct authority over which programs. Secretary of Labor, of course, has jurisdiction over unemployment programs. And clearly, there are concerns as tens of thousands of Americans have been laid off and are being laid off about what actions the government can take to make sure that the safety net is working for them. And so that's what he's referring to.
 Let me broaden this for a second, because a lot of the questions are on what are we going to do on aviation security, on the economy stimulus, on help for uninsured workers. And I just want to reiterate something I mentioned last week. Throughout this process, still, the normal, deliberative, thoughtful fashion of the government has got to go on. There is going to planning on the military front. There is of course a rush to action to help people in New York and at the Pentagon respond to the immediacies of the disasters.
 But when it comes to what domestic action needs to be taken, one of the strengths of our country, and one of the factors of a Congress is that it needs to be carefully thought through, developed, worked with the Congress, hearings held. And that in itself is a process that takes time. And the administration recognizes that. So that's one of the reasons you're hearing on a lot of these issues, it's under review, et cetera. There won't be a rush to action; there is going to be action taken at the appropriate time.
 Q:With respect to that, Secretary O'Neill has indicated that if there is to be any stimulus package, you need probably at least another week to asses the impact of September 11th. Would you agree with that time frame?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, I'm not going to comment on any particular timetable. But as I indicated, it's a process that will take an amount of time to make certain that's a deliberative and thoughtful process. I'm not going to put a hard day on it. It very well may turn out to be exactly that. It may turn out to be somewhat closer or different from that.
 Q:Just a follow-up on Keith's question. The President's not worried at all that wrapping up TPA into the economic stimulus package is going to kill any chance of getting a stimulus package through, if in --
 MR. FLEISCHER: One, I never said anything about wrapping it up into a stimulus package. I talked about it, as others have, on its own merit, and its own intrinsic worth. But no determination is made about whether that will be part of an existing stimulus or not. But no, that remains an important issue for many Democrats and Republicans, and something the President feels strongly about.
 Q:On the stimulus package, does the administration share the concern of some economists that there's a danger here of replicating policy mistakes of the late '60s, building in too much stimulus that would then have the effect of laying the groundwork for an inflation problem down the road?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, without addressing specifically that one concern, there are a variety of reasons that the thoughtful process that our framers left to us that has gotten this nation through times of war and times of peace is a process that needs to be followed. And that is why, as I indicate, it's going to be deliberative, it's going to be thoughtful. It won't be a rush to come out with an economic stimulus because the nation was attacked; it has to be done right.
 And that's why the President met with the leaders today, to discuss it with them, to talk it through with them, to listen and to hear their ideas to share his thoughts. And that's how the process will go. And then, of course, it's going to go through the regular order of the Congress, which is a process that takes weeks.
 Q:Is it possible to offer some indication of the extent to which, in the debate within the administration, the prospect or the problems of potential inflation in the future are being factored into this deliberative process?
 MR. FLEISCHER: In the meetings that I've been in, I have not heard that explicitly said. There are lots of economists in this building though, so I wouldn't rule out that some economist somewhere said something.
 Q:The administration has said war or recession justifies spending the Social Security surplus. But do they believe the same things justify going into deficit spending, or is there a bottom line on how much they would spend?
 MR. FLEISCHER: The President's priority is to take the necessary steps to protect this nation in the wake of this attack, and to assemble the coalition and give it the means required so that we can be victorious in this was throughout whatever period of time it's going to take.
 The budget implications of that remain to be precisely determined, and those will also substantially be driven by the strength of the economy and how quickly the economy comes back. So we'll all have at our disposal the latest estimates, as time goes by, about the shape of the economy.
 But make no mistake about the President's priority is to give the resources necessary to fight and win a war. He will always be mindful that whatever actions are taken still involve taxpayer dollars. And that's when it comes to the domestic consequences, when it comes to any industries that are asking for assistance, or whether it comes to the means necessary to fight the war.
 Q:But you would not rule out deficit spending, if that's what it takes to fight the war?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, right now the government continues to have a very large surplus. I think the other day I explained that this was the first time in the nation's history that the government has had a surplus as it began a major military effort like this. Previously, it's always had deficits, which puts the country, economically speaking, in a stronger position to begin this effort. But those are the President's priorities.
 Q:On coalition-building, can you -- the significance of the Saudi move, cutting off from the Taliban?
 MR. FLEISCHER: That's a very significant step for the Saudi government to take. And the President, as he indicated, is appreciate of the actions that they have taken in this regard.
 Q:Ari, are you confident you can pass trade promotion authority this fall, and avoid a difficult fight --
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, I think you have to let it develop on the Hill. And to continue -- the President will continue to work it in a bipartisan fashion. He'll continue to listen and to have outreach. Clearly, even in this wonderfully new mood of cooperation that has taken place on the Hill, nobody expects votes to be 535-0. But we still have a system, and it's a system that has worked well throughout times of war and times of peace. And the President is going to continue to do everything he can to work cooperatively with as many people as possible. Hence this morning's meetings with the Democrats and the Republicans.
 Q:This morning, Representative Gephardt said that on the education bill, he needed to talk to more of his members, this was going to take more time, that there was a lot more work to be done. Is the administration disappointed in that? Does the President want to get this done? Is this an indication, even quietly, of the return of some of the partisan differences over that issue in particular?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I don't think it's a return to partisan differences, Terry. I think it's the right of members of Congress to weigh in. And there are 535 people who have a right to weigh in. And there are going to be a variety of viewpoints expressed. The important thing is to keep the sense of comity and working together strong. And that's why the President met this morning with the Speaker, the Minority Leader, the Majority Leader. And he'll continue to do that.
 Will there be voices from the Hill that disagree with the administration on issues? Of course. But, together, a lot can still be accomplished on the issues like education, on patients' bill of rights, on trade promotion authority, on an energy package. Senator Lieberman has indicated interest in continuing to move the faith-based package. So there continues to be signs of good progress on the Hill.
 Q:Even on education? It doesn't look like that's going anywhere for the moment.
 MR. FLEISCHER: No, I think clearly it's going. It's heading into the Conference Committee. Nobody expected it to be passed today. We have to wrap this in just a minute, because we've got to all get to the FBI.
 Q:Ari, are there plans to have meetings like the one with the congressional leaders once a week, like a regular meeting with congressional leadership every week?
 MR. FLEISCHER: It's not a regularly scheduled once a week, but it just seems to be working out that way, at least at this point. And a lot of phone conversations as well.
 THE PRESS: Thank you.
 MR. FLEISCHER: Thank you.

MR. FLEISCHER: Good afternoon. Let me update you on the President's day, and then I'll be more than happy to take any questions. The President this morning spoke with Dutch Prime Minister Kok. The President and the Prime Minister expressed their agreement about the need for full solidarity, and the Prime Minister said that the Dutch government would be with the people of the United States and stressed that solidarity means deeds, not just words.
 The President also this morning spoke with Kazakhstan President Nazarbayev. The two Presidents discussed cooperation in the common fight against terrorism. And President Nazarbayev reiterated that Kazakhstan will support the U.S.-led effort ""with all available means.""
 The President earlier this morning convened a meeting of his National Security Council. He concluded just recently a meeting -- it may still be going on, if it's not quite concluded -- with a group of American Sikhs, another reminder to the American people of the importance of waging a battle against intolerance and prejudice in this country as we proceed with this fight against terrorism. The American Sikh community has been beset with occasional violence and it's another reminder about the need for Americans to honor our constitutional principles in respecting all Americans and all visitors to our country throughout this time.
 The President will depart for the Central Intelligence Agency in the early afternoon, where he will have a briefing over at CIA, take a tour of the CIA, and thank the CIA employees for all the efforts that they are making to win the war against terrorism.
 Upon his return to the White House in the mid-afternoon, the President will meet with a group of Muslim leaders to send another signal, another reminder to the American people about the need to be -- to avoid prejudice and intolerance. The Muslim American community has been very supportive and cooperative with all efforts to win the war on terrorism, and the President is very appreciative of that.
 He will meet with the Foreign Minister of Egypt at 4:15 p.m. in the Oval Office. And at 4:50 p.m., the President will have a meeting of his Domestic Consequences Group to discuss economic actions that the government may be able to take to help provide a stimulus to the economy.
 A couple updates on other events or briefings: Secretary Powell will also meet with the Egyptian Foreign Minister at 2:30 p.m., and then the two will participate in a joint stakeout at the State Department at 3:00 p.m. In addition to the schedule from what I announced earlier, Attorney General Ashcroft and FBI Director Mueller will also hold a briefing for the American people at 3:15 p.m., open to the press, of course, to continue to communicate with the American people about the efforts underway in the war against terrorism.
 Q:Ari, Pakistan says they've been discussing with the U.S. a broad agreement on an operational plan that includes attacks on camps in Afghanistan. Is that report inaccurate?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Ron, I'm not going to characterize in any way any of the operational details about what the United States may or may not be discussing with any of our coalition friends.
 Q:Is the United States taking a softer line on Russia over Chechnya in return for the cooperation Putin has offered in this effort?
 MR. FLEISCHER: President Putin gave a very important speech the other day. This should be noted. President Bush appreciated very much President Putin's offer of concrete cooperation in the common fight against international terrorism. And President Putin's remarks demonstrate that Russia can make a major contribution to that common struggle against international terrorism, while at the same time displaying a respect for the sovereignty and independence of Russia's neighbors.
 In particular, the President noted and wants to thank President Putin for his offer to provide, as President Putin described it, permission for humanitarian overflights, information about the situation on the ground, as well as search and rescue operations, if necessary. The President looks forward to continuing to work with the Russia government together as we build this international coalition.
 But the President also wants to note particularly President Putin's remarks about the situation in Chechnya in which President Putin called on Chechen insurgents to disassociate themselves immediately from the international terrorist networks, and meet for discussions to resolve the crisis in Chechnya.
 The Chechnya leadership, like all responsible political leaders in the world, must immediately and unconditionally cut all contacts with international terrorist groups, such as Osama bin Laden and the al Qaeda organization. At the same time, the United States has long said that the only solution in Chechnya is a political solution, a political process to resolve the conflict there. The President welcomes the sincere steps that have been taken by Russia to engage the Chechen leadership and, consistent with what you've heard repeatedly, respect for human rights and accountability for violations on all sides is crucial to a durable peace there.
 Q:Does this offer by Putin reflect any input by the United States, did Bush suggest that you needed to do something on Chechnya? And do you have any idea what might happen if the 72-hour period expires without an acceptance by the rebels?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Actually, there's been an update on that. As you may have heard, Chechen leader, Mr. Maskhadov has responded, indicated a commitment to the peace process. He has indicated a willingness, and so it's important now to let events develop in Chechnya. That is an encouraging sign.
 Q:And so, the administration believes, with President Putin, that the resistance in Chechnya has been infiltrated and is linked to the same terrorist networks that committed the atrocities in New York?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Terry, there is no question that there is an international terrorist presence in Chechnya that has links to Osama bin Laden. And that's why I indicated what I indicated. That also is a point of view that was shared with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in, I believe, it was November of 1999 by a spokesman, an official from the Clinton State Department when he testified before Senate Foreign Relations. So that's been long been known; in fact, it's been referenced in the Pattern of Global Terrorism Report, which was issued by the State Department.
 Q:One more on this. Would, then, Chechen separatists, by the statement you ready today also calling on them to cut off links to this group -- are they on notice as the Taliban is that they will share the terrorists' fate if they don't do so?
 MR. FLEISCHER: No, the President's words speak for themselves about those terrorist organizations that have global reach. But what's notable here is, the President is reiterating that it's important to have a political solution to the situation in Chechnya. But, undeniably, there are terrorists' organizations in Chechnya that have ties to Osama bin Laden.
 Q:And did he suggest this offer by Putin? Did the President and Putin discuss this offer in advance of Putin's making it? Does this reflect U.S. input?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I'd have to check, Randy. Don't know.
 Q:Haven't we made many statements denouncing Russia for its attacks at Chechnya? And is there some image of some freedom fighters there? And all of a sudden, you're calling them terrorists?
 MR. FLEISCHER: As I just indicated, the concern for human rights remains a vital part of American policy, and the only solution to the problem in Chechnya is a political one.
 Q:Yes. But why is it just today that you're calling them terrorists? What has changed? Is this what Putin has asked for, in exchange for his help?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, as I indicated, that's not the case. That's been the longstanding position.
 Q:I think this is the first time -- is this not the first time you've used this word at that podium?
 Q:It's the first time we've heard it.
 MR. FLEISCHER: I'm not sure that I have discussed the situation in Chechnya with the White House Press Corps prior to this. We haven't had much reason to do so. But that's why I indicated, going back to the previous administration, in testimony before the Senate, they said what they said because it's true. And the State Department publishes a report every year that included similar information.
 Q:Is it fair to assume that these words from you are in exchange for Putin's cooperation on the U.S. effort?
 MR. FLEISCHER: No, it's an accurate statement about the situation on the ground and the importance of the speech that President Putin made. But keep in mind, President Putin called for political discussions, which leaders of Chechnya have now indicated they are willing to engage in such discussions. That's a positive development.
 Q:Sounds like a deal, though. It sounds like in exchange for Putin's support, we, rhetorically from this podium, are lending him support in characterizing the opposition as international terrorists.
 MR. FLEISCHER: No, no such conclusion should be reached. This is consistent with actions taken by the previous administration, because it's an accurate statement about developments in Chechnya.
 Q:Can you give us the date of that Senate testimony?
 MR. FLEISCHER: If I recall, it was November 1999.
 Q:Is the administration planning to go to the U.N. Security Council before for approval before any sort of military action is taken? And do you think that's something you should do? Is it necessary?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Number one, the United Nations through the Security Council has already spoken out on this matter. Number two --
 Q:But not on military action.
 MR. FLEISCHER: Number two, in accordance with the U.N. Charter, the United States has the right to self-defense, of course. The President has spoken directly on that point. But no decision has been reached about whether or not there will be any additional requests made of or through the United Nations. There's just no determination at this time.
 Q:But it's something under discussion that you're talking about?
 MR. FLEISCHER: It's one of many options that could be used, but there's no determination.
 Q:Senator Shelby continues to suggest that CIA Director Tenet should probably step down. Is the President planning today to indicate his support for the Director?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Director Tenet has the full faith and confidence of the President. The President will be at the CIA. He'll have public remarks, so you'll have to hear those yourself.
 Q:How does the White House, CIA and so forth view bin Laden? Is he a religious leader or a political leader, or both?
 MR. FLEISCHER: He's a terrorist. He's a leader of a terrorist organization that has inflicted grievous harm on our country. That is the only way to see him. The President has described him as an evildoer, and the President has said that this is a struggle between good and evil.
 Q:But deeper into that, do you consider him a religious leader or a political leader?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I think it's so hard to assign any religious value to the acts that he's carried out. There is no religion that preaches or tolerates the murder of innocent civilians, as he has done to our nation. There is only one word to describe him, and that is a terrorist.
 Q:I mean, terrorist is an all-encompassing word. What do you think his goals are? Political, are they not?
 MR. FLEISCHER: His goals are murderous, and that's how he's viewed.
 Q:Just to murder --
 Q:Actually, kind of following up on that, but maybe a little more personal, President Mubarak has basically said the President was a target in Genoa during the summit. A few weeks ago, you were concerned that Air Force One was a target of the attacks. Does the White House believe that bin Laden is trying to kill the President?
 MR. FLEISCHER: You know, I'm not going to comment on any particular threats coming toward the White House. Unfortunately, as you all who work here know, it is not an uncommon occurrence for people to threaten the government of the United States, regardless of whether it's President Bush or any of his predecessors. And that's why there are security precautions taken at the White House as a matter of routine.
 But that's not what this is about. This has nothing to do with anything individual that may or may not have been directed at President Bush; this is about an attack that took place on our country.
 Q:Ari, on your Chicago trip tomorrow, the President is going to announce some security measures for the airlines?
 MR. FLEISCHER: The President has been reviewing reactions that the government should appropriately take to help protect the traveling public through increased security at the nation's airports and on airplanes. The President has a visit to Chicago tomorrow where he will discuss a series of issues important to the traveling public and to the airline industry, and when the President has concluded his review, he will make the announcement himself.
 Q:Tomorrow?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I think that's a good possibility, Elizabeth.
 Q:Ari, is anything off the table, though, any of the options, such as guns in the cockpit or federal employees to be the airport screeners? Are those off the table?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I think at this point it's best to let the President express it for himself. He'll be doing that shortly.
 Q:So he's going potentially tomorrow, so is it fair to say he's pretty much decided, there's a decision-making agreement?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I think he's likely to have a couple of additional conversations today.
 Q:Ari, any reaction to the burning of buildings in the embassy grounds, U.S. embassy grounds in Kabul?
 MR. FLEISCHER: There's no immediate -- I mean, I think it's just another sign of the fact that this is serious. That was an abandoned building, as you know. The United States left it many, many years ago, but it doesn't change anything about what the President has said or what the mission of the United States will be.
 Q:Ari, on Pakistan, this is not an operational question, but the Foreign Minister is quoted as saying he's asked the administration to put aside any notion of supporting Afghan opposition groups. Is this a roll-back on Pakistan's part? What is your assessment of the level of cooperation the U.S. is getting from Pakistan?
 MR. FLEISCHER: It's been very good. And as I've indicated all week, there are going to be certain areas in which different nations cooperate in different ways. And I think you can anticipate that with Pakistan, as well as any number of nations.
 Q:Could I follow on that, though? Have the Pakistanis warned the administration about supporting the Northern Alliance in the overthrow of the Taliban? Have they expressed concern about the President's comments sort of encouraging the people of Afghanistan to step up -- of the Taliban regime?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, historically, there are certain facts about the relationship between the Northern Alliance and Pakistan that are indisputable. And as the United States goes about building the effort to put an end to the terrorist actions that are fostered in Afghanistan by Osama bin Laden, the al Qaeda organization, hosted by and harbored by the Taliban government, the United States will keep all these interrelationships in mind.
 Q:So Pakistan has legitimate interests inside Afghanistan which we will take into account?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I think it's a very complicated region of the world, Terry, where there's a host of groups and nations that have longstanding -- have various amounts of interests. And as I indicated, there is an historical relationship between the Northern Alliance and the Pakistan government, which the United States is aware of and sensitive to.
 Q:Ari, Iran has soundly rejected any overtures that the U.S. might or might not be making in terms of building an international coalition; in fact, calling the U.S. effort ""disgusting."" Any reaction?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, again, the President has made it clear that this is a time for nations to choose about whether they are with the United States and the free world in the war against terrorism or they are not. And I will leave it at that.
 Q:Ari, is the President going to have any concrete requests about how he wants Egypt to be involved in this war today?
 MR. FLEISCHER: He may. But, again, I'm not going to be at liberty to get into any specific requests that the United States is asking. But Egypt has been a good friend of the United States before, and the relationship remains very strong.
 Q:Ari, I know you don't want to comment on specific tax cuts that you're considering, or at least you didn't this morning. But would you comment on whether or not tax cuts that people are considering as part of the stimulus package potentially should be temporary, or should they again be looking at long-term tax cuts as were passed earlier?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I think from the President's point of view, it will all depend on the substance of the specific tax cut, for example. The tax cut that has been passed by the Congress and signed into law, the President obviously believes that should be permanent. The President believes that is helpful for the economy now and long-term, and plus it's the right thing to do. People should not have a marriage penalty reimposed on them for any reason, for example.
 Other ideas that are new will be considered, and there are some suggestions that some of those be temporary, and I think the President will weigh any reason for something to be temporary, as opposed to permanent, in the context of whatever that new idea may be.
 Q:Okay. And are reports correct that the White House has been specifically pushing for a cut in corporate taxes?
 MR. FLEISCHER: That's one of the options that's under review.
 Q:Have you been pushing for that on the Hill? Supporting that?
 MR. FLEISCHER: The White House isn't pushing for anything on the Hill because the President hasn't given any indications yet about any determinations or decisions that he has made. There have been a series of conversations with people on the Hill where the pros and cons of various proposals have been walked through, including a reduction in the corporate tax rate, but that falls under the category of a series of tax items that have been discussed with the Hill. But I think that's what you're hearing.
 Q:Ari, is there going to be any economic announcements tomorrow, therefore, in Chicago, along these lines of a stimulus?
MR. FLEISCHER: I would just wait until tomorrow. And you've asked me a question about airlines tomorrow, and I'm not going to go beyond that. The President may have something to say tomorrow on that topic.
 Q:-- just for the airlines --
 MR. FLEISCHER: The event tomorrow is more focused on the airlines. But at all times, the President is concerned about the economy. He'll have remarks tomorrow, and I'll just leave it at that.
 Q:Can I just follow on that --
 Q:Ari, when the Republican leadership says that Larry Lindsey is pushing for a corporate tax cut, they're mistaken?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Can you tell me who is saying that?
 Q:Dick Armey.
 MR. FLEISCHER: I'm not aware of any conversation like that. I know that -- I've talked to Dr. Lindsey about this and what he's indicated to me is he's had a series of conversations, just as I outlined, where he is talking about the pros and cons of a variety of proposals, including a reduction in the corporate rates.
 Q:But he's not pushing it, he's just saying, these are our options? He's not favoring one or the other?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I think Larry is well aware, as many of the advisors to the President are, that there are a series of pros and cons that come with these actions.
 Q:Ari, getting back to the issue of getting things back to normal, the President is going to be flying out to Chicago tomorrow. He had this meeting with the Boys and Girls Club this morning. When will the White House be back to full-speed, the typical activities before September 11th, with the public tours and things of that nature, especially since you said today is the first time for this Boys and Girls Club or any other group to come to meet with the President?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, let me answer that -- I mean, full-speed -- given the events of September 11th, it would be nice to slow down to full-speed. It's not a question of full-speed, it's just a question of there has been a necessary realignment of the President's time and schedule so he can focus more of his time, unfortunately, on war preparations. That is typical in any American presidency, or most American presidencies.
 But there are increasing signs that the other parts of the agenda are showing back up on the President's school and other people's schedules. And you cited a couple of those examples today -- the meeting with the Boys Club today, the travel to Chicago tomorrow. The President and his wife went out for dinner last night. I mean, I think these things also marry to some degree what the American people are doing. They're increasingly getting back on with their lives.
 Q:Where did they go to dinner last night? And I have a follow-up to that. Where did they go to dinner?
 MR. FLEISCHER: They went to a restaurant in Arlington. The press went with them. There's a pool report available on it; it was a publicly-announced trip. They went last night.
 Q:No wonder traffic was so bad on the way home. (Laughter.)
 Q:Ari, a follow-up to that, though. The situation, though --
 MR. FLEISCHER: No, there was a report on it last night. The press went with them. The press always goes with them.
 Q:The newspapers haven't seen a pool report on this.
 MR. FLEISCHER: I can tell you the pool went with them.
 Q:Okay, well, come back. As far as people coming back into the White House, this is, like you said earlier, this is a first since September 11th. Is the White House -- is the feeling here at the White House that the threat here has lessened for the American public to come back into this place, the people's house?
 MR. FLEISCHER: What I indicated this morning was, it's not a first for visitors to coming to the White House on September 11th. The White House has been entertaining visitors to the White House since September 11th on a regular basis. This was the first of where the more traditional -- they're called literally photo opportunities, but the more ceremonial part of a presidency, where the President will meet with various award winners across the United States to thank them and to honor them for, in this case, being the Boys Club Youth of the Year.
 The President's had a series of meetings like he's had today with the Muslim leaders, with the Sikh leaders. He's had earlier meetings with other groups throughout the period since September 11th. Those are private citizens coming to the White House for specific purposes. What took place today, though, was a return to the more ceremonial aspects of the job.
 Q:Will the public tours resume again soon?
 MR. FLEISCHER: We'll announce that whenever they do. There is no information on that at this time.
 Q:Ari, on the airlines, is there some sort of snag in getting the $5 billion in emergency funding to the airlines?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I think that OMB announced last night that that money was being released. There is a formula for its distribution, and that formula is set in law by the act of Congress which the President signed. So the money has been released as of yesterday. I'm now aware of any problems -- it was released yesterday.
 Q:Has the President had any communication with Representative Cooksey regarding his comments on Sikh Americans? And does he have a message for lawmakers and members of his party in particular about this issue?
 MR. FLEISCHER: The President's message is to all Americans. It's important for all Americans to remember the traditions of our country that make us so strong and so free, our tolerance and openness and acceptance. All Americans -- and we come from a very rich cultural heritage, no matter what anybody's background in this country. And that's the strength of this country, and that's the President's message that he expressed in his speech to Congress and as he has done when he visited the mosque a week ago Monday, and in the meetings that he's hosting here at the White House today with Muslim Americans and Sikh Americans.
 Q:Did he speak to Representative Cooksey, and what were his reactions upon hearing those?
 MR. FLEISCHER: The President was very disturbed by those remarks.
 Q:Ari, does the President believe that in order for the coalition in the Middle East, those who are supporting the United States, to hold together, Ariel Sharon and Israel have to make concessions towards peace, as well as Chairman Arafat? I mean, is there a direct linkage to the peace process and maintaining any coalition in this war effort?
 MR. FLEISCHER: The President believes that all the parties in the Middle East have to take advantage of what is happening today and see this as a moment to realize the repercussions of going down the wrong road, and that's a road that has led to terrorism and to conflict and in the Middle East has led to war. And that's why the President feels so strongly and has said this to leaders, that they should seize this moment and renew their efforts to accomplish a lasting peace in the Middle East.
 And toward that, of course, there was a meeting this morning between Foreign Minister Peres and Chairman Arafat, where they agreed to sustain their cease-fire and to resume security cooperation. And the President welcomes that announcement and that development from this morning. That's something that the President and Secretary Powell have been encouraging the parties to do on a rather repeated basis.
 The President welcomes a reiteration of both sides to their commitment to implement the Tenet and the Mitchell plans, and this meeting this morning constitutes an important first step toward the development of a more concrete and lasting approach to restoring trust and confidence in the region.
 Q:Ari, can I come back to the Chicago trip? Putting aside the issue, the specifics of what the President is going to announce tomorrow, does the President have a message behind this trip of whether it's now safe for Americans to fly again?
 MR. FLEISCHER: The President's trip is designed to talk to the airline workers and to thank them for returning to the flight schedules that they have returned to, to thank them for doing their part to combat terrorism and to get America moving again. He may have some additional things to say on some of the policy items that we've been discussing.
 But I do know that typically in America, there are some 5,500 to 6,500 flights a day in our commercial industry. There are now, today, or at least as of yesterday, 4,500 to 5,500 flights taking off and landing safely every day across our country.
 We're not back at exactly where we were prior to September 11th, but there are an awful lot of flights flying every day, safely taking Americans to where they want to travel, and that's an encouraging sign. There are just increasing signs of life in America is getting back to normal, as normal can ever be at a time where the President will still remind the American people that threats remain and the nation is preparing for war.
 Q:-- Americans not to be afraid of flying?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I think every American is going to come to their own judgment. And for some Americans, obviously, the 4,500 to 5,500 flights a day, many Americans have already come to the conclusion it's safe to fly, and they've safely flown. Other Americans are going to approach this on their own time, at their own pace, and the President understands that. So that's an individual decision people are making, but according to how many flights have been taking off and landing every day, that's a decision people are increasingly feeling comfortable with. The President will continue to remind people that it's important to remember the threat is not eliminated.
 Q:But they're only flying at 30 percent capacity, though, Ari, and that's the problem. I mean, the flights are in the air --
 MR. FLEISCHER: No doubt about it. It's exactly right. The flights -- when I give the numbers about the flights taking off and landing safely, that's not an indication that each of the flights is 100 percent occupancy. There is no question about that, and that's one of the reasons the President is going to travel to Chicago tomorrow and talk to the people in the airline industry, because they're hurting as a result of the lack of passengers.
 Q:The question is, I think, what is the President going to say to people to try to reassure the public that it is safe for them to get back on those planes? I mean, the planes are in the air, but what can he say to tell people, look, we're doing everything we can and it is now safe to get back in the air?
 MR. FLEISCHER: And that's one of the reasons that the President has been focused on development of a security package to help increase security and protection for the traveling public of both airports and airlines. And he'll have more to say on that directly, himself.
 Q:Related to Jim's question, to your knowledge, how many administration officials, White House staff, or in the agencies and departments are traveling commercially this week or next week?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I can tell you I know on last Friday, OMB Director Mitch Daniels flew home commercial to Indiana, came back, I believe, on Sunday. I'm flying commercial somewhere today for Yom Kippur. So it's been across the government there have been a series of travels. I think you'd have to talk to each of the different agencies to get the specific information.
 Q:Cabinet Secretaries also are routinely now traveling commercial?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Again, you'd have to talk to each agency; I don't keep track of all their travel. So you'd have to talk agency by agency. I can tell you about Mitch, because I just heard Mitch say that, that he flew home commercial last Friday, just as I'm flying home to New York commercial today.
 Q:Can I just follow up with one more on the CIA -- Director Tenet, the President, of course, having full faith and confidence in him. But in terms of the agency, the President has not, of course, wanted to look back, he's wanted to look forward. But doesn't he believe the fact that the U.S. had no specific warnings of these attacks that they're somewhat of an indictment of U.S. intelligence operations?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I think the President views it as a reflection of the fact that we are an open society, a free society; that the CIA has in the past been very successful in catching and preventing acts of terrorism. Obviously, the attacks took place on September 11th, they were not detected and they were not caught ahead of time. But the President's focus right now is on winning the war on terrorism. And I reiterate, he has full faith and confidence in Director Tenet.
 Q:Ari, an IMF official today made the statement that a recession in the United States was a done deal. Now, he took back that formulation but, obviously, that was his outlook. Does the White House agree with this, that a recession in the short term at any rate, is going to be inevitable in the United States?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, the President remains very concerned about the state of the economy, and that's one of the reasons he's having the meeting today, to talk to his advisors about what steps can be taken to help promote economic growth.
 Now, the President continues to believe that the tax cut is the right policy; the Federal Reserve rate cuts have been the right policy and that will have a helpful combination in bringing the economy back. But there's no doubt about it, the attack on our country September 11th has had an adverse effect on the economy. I'm not going to go beyond that. That's an economic definition of a recession and that will be determined by the data as it comes in.
 Q:The House next week is planning to move a farm bill, which, as I understand it, could add some $73 billion, $74 billion over the next 10 years. Does the White House support that bill?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Let me take that question and get back to you on the farm bill, Keith.
 Q:Ari, back to the airline security thing and Americans getting more comfortable with flying. There have been several incidents since the September 11th attack where people have intentionally breached security to prove the point that it is still ineffective. My question is, is that inappropriate or is ignoring that reality and arresting people who do that casting a false sense of security.
 MR. FLEISCHER: I think that at a time when the people at the airports are working very hard to secure the airports for the traveling public, I think it's not appropriate for anything to engage in anything symbolic of that nature. It's a distraction that prevents the people who are doing their jobs from being able to carry out their mission if people are doing it for the purpose of doing something symbolic.
 Having said that, the President understands that we do need to increase security at airports and give more protections to the traveling public, and he'll have more to say on that point shortly.
 Q:-- about the war, just for a second. Since September the 11th, have there been any serious -- underline the word serious -- discussions at the National Security Council meetings about bringing back the draft? And how does the President feel about the possibility of the draft?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Yes, I've asked that question, and the answer that I've gotten directly from DOD is no, there has been no consideration of that.
 Q:As Commander-In-Chief, what was the President's reaction to television's Bill Maher, in his announcement that members of our Armed Forces who deal with missiles are cowards, while the armed terrorists who killed 6,000 unarmed are not cowards, for which Maher was briefly moved off a Washington television station?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I have not discussed it with the President, one. I have --
 Q:Surely, as a --
 MR. FLEISCHER: I'm getting there.
 Q:Surely as Commander, he was enraged at that, wasn't he?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I'm getting there, Les.
 Q:Okay.
 MR. FLEISCHER: I'm aware of the press reports about what he said. I have not seen the actual transcript of the show itself. But assuming the press reports are right, it's a terrible thing to say, and it unfortunate. And that's why -- there was an earlier question about has the President said anything to people in his own party -- they're reminders to all Americans that they need to watch what they say, watch what they do. This is not a time for remarks like that; there never is.
 Q:The Washington Times reports that the Reverend Jesse Jackson has nominated himself to go to Afghanistan. My question is, does the President believe this would be useful, or would it be better for the cause of justice that since the former head of United Way is in federal prison for spending tax-exempt funds on his mistress, that the Reverend Mr. Jackson at least be investigated by the Department of Justice?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I've got no comment on Mr. Jackson's possible -- the Reverend Jackson's possible travel. I would just reiterate what the President has said, the he will not engage in any negotiations or discussions.
 Thank you.

George W. Bush,"September 26, 2001",Remarks Prior to Discussions With Muslim Community Leaders and an Exchange With Reporters,"The President. It's my honor to welcome to the White House my fellow Americans, Arab Americans, Americans who are Muslim by faith, to discuss about the current incident that took place, the aftermath of the incident, and what our country is going to do to make sure that everybody who is an American is respected.
I have told the Nation more than once that ours is a war against evil, against extremists, that the teachings of Islam are the teachings of peace and good. And the Al Qaida organization is not an organization of good, an organization of peace; it's an organization based upon hate and evil.
I also want to assure my fellow Americans that when you pledge allegiance to the flag with your hand on your heart, you pledge just as hard to the flag as I do; that the outpouring of support for our country has come from all corners of the country, including many members of the Muslim faith. And for that I am grateful.
I appreciate the contributions of time, the contributions of blood to help our fellow Americans who have been injured. And I'm proud of the Muslim leaders across America who have risen up and who have not only insisted that America be strong but that America keep the values intact that have made us so unique and different, the values of respect, the values of freedom to worship the way we see fit. And I also appreciate the prayers to the universal God.
And so, thank you all for coming. I don't know if you all remember, the imam led the service at the National Cathedral. He did a heck of a good job, and we were proud to have him there. And I want to thank you very much for the gift you gave me, Imam, the Koran. It's a very thoughtful gift. I said, ""Thank you very much for the gift."" He said, ""It's the best gift I could give you, Mr. President."" I appreciate that very much.
Q. Mr. President——
Assistant Press Secretary Gordon Johndroe. Thank you all very much. Thank you all.
Q. Mr. President——
The President. Yes? Wait a minute. I feel guilty that John [John Roberts, CBS News] couldn't—yes?
U.S. Intelligence
Q. Sir, Senator Shelby this morning had some pretty direct comments about his thinking that somebody needs to be held accountable for what has been characterized by some people as a massive intelligence failure. I wonder what you think of his comments. Is he trying to inject politics in this? Does someone need to fall on their sword, if you will?
The President. Well, John, the intelligence-gathering capacity of the United States is doing a fine job. These terrorists had burrowed in our country for over 2 years. They were well organized. They were well planned. They struck in a way that was unimaginable. And we are a united nation. We're going to go forward with our war against these terrorists. And our Nation should have all the confidence that the intelligence-gathering capacity of the United States is doing everything possible to not only keep us informed about what's happening overseas but to keep us informed about what might happen here at home.
Q. So how would you characterize his comments over the last few days?
The President. Well, he's a concerned American. I'm sure other Americans are asking how could this have happened, including the President. But what Americans need to know is that I'm receiving excellent intelligence; the CIA is doing a fine job; the FBI is responding on every single lead we're getting; and that we're doing everything we can to make the homeland safe, as well as everything we can to bring people to justice.
Usama bin Laden
Q. Granted the extremism, do you—and I'd like to ask the imam the same question—do you consider bin Laden a religious leader or a political leader?
The President. I consider bin Laden an evil man. And I don't think there's any religious justification for what he has in mind. Islam is a religion of love, not hate. This is a man who hates. This is a man who's declared war on innocent people. This is a man who doesn't mind destroying women and children. This is man who hates freedom. This is an evil man.
Q. But does he have political goals?
The President. He has got evil goals. And it's hard to think in conventional terms about a man so dominated by evil that he's willing to do what he thinks he's going to get away with. But he's not going to get away with it.
Airline Industry
Q. Sir, there were thousands of more layoffs in the airline industry today. What is the administration going to do about it?
The President. Come to Chicago tomorrow.
Assistant Press Secretary Johndroe. Thanks. Thank you all. Can we go now? Thank you. I don't want to shout you down, so let's just leave. Thank you.
Situation in the Middle East
Q. On the Middle East—think that's going to lead to a durable peace in the Middle East?
The President. Steve's [Steve Holland, Reuters] question was on the Middle East. Sorry, Gordon. That's what happens when you invite guys—[laughter]. You invite John Roberts in here—aggressive reporters, you get—Steve asked about the Middle East.
We're encouraged that there are discussions going on that could lead to the implementation of Mitchell. There is the framework for peace. There is the process now available. It's the Mitchell plan, which everybody agreed to, is the right way to get to a peaceful resolution in the Middle East. And there is a series of discussions that took place. Hopefully, there will be more discussions and that both parties get into Mitchell. And that's going to be good for America, and it will be good for the Middle East and good for the world. And so we're hopeful.
I don't know if you remember, but I said, out of this crisis, this tragedy that hit America, I do see opportunity. And one of the opportunities would be that there's some sensible thinking that goes into the Middle East and that people now realize that this violence, this terrible destruction of human life, is not the correct path to follow and that, hopefully, people use this example as—the incidents that took place on September 11th to bring some reality to the Middle East.
The discussions are moving on. And I want to thank the Secretary of State for staying with it, staying on the phone, and encouraging both parties to get to the table. And we'll see what happens. We're hopeful.
Chechnya
Q. Mr. President, have you changed your thinking on Chechnya, in light of what's happened since September 11th?
The President. Well, first of all, to the extent that there are terrorists in Chechnya, Arab terrorists associated with the Al Qaida organization, I believe they ought to be brought to justice; as you heard me say, that our initial phase of the war on terrorism is against the Al Qaida organization. And we do believe there are some Al Qaida folks in Chechnya.
However, I do believe it's very important for President Putin to deal with the Chechen minority in this country with respect, respect of human rights and respect of difference of opinion about religion, for example. And so I would hope that the Russian President, while dealing with the Al Qaida organization, also respects minority rights within his country.
Airport and Airline Security
Q. Mr. President, tomorrow you'll be announcing some new security measures, one of them likely to include some Federal role in training airport security personnel and monitoring their work as time goes on, moving forward.
The President. Well, we're going to deal with airport security tomorrow, as well as other measures, to try to convince the American public it is safe to fly. One of my concerns is that this terrible incident has said to many Americans—convinced many Americans to stay at home. And one of the keys to economic recovery is going to be a vital—the vitality of the airline industry.
I presume many of you came to Washington today by flying, and you're here safely. And it's a—we'll announce some confidence-boosting measures, some concrete proposals, and I believe we'll be able to work with Congress to get them done in an expeditious way.
Q. You don't support arming pilots?
The President. Army pilots?
Q. Arming pilots.
The President. Oh, arming. As I said, I look forward to any suggestion that—there may be better ways to do it than that, but I'm open for any suggestion. And the good news is, is that there's a willingness on Capitol Hill to work with the administration, and vice versa, to come up with constructive, sound ways to convince the American public it's safe to fly.
Q. How quickly do you think you can put these plans in place?
The President. Oh, some of them will be—some of them will take a while; some of them could happen very quickly. Just give me a chance to give my speech. You're trying to jump the gun on me, Stretch [Richard Keil, Bloomberg News]. [Laughter]
Q. It's my job, sir.
The President. You're doing it well, too, my boy. [Laughter]
John, no longer can you say, I haven't answered your questions. [Laughter]
Q. One of the three ain't bad. Thank you, sir. [Laughter]
The President. [Inaudible]—batting .333. All right.
Q. Thank you.
The President. Gordon, good job—no questions. [Laughter]",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-prior-discussions-with-muslim-community-leaders-and-exchange-with-reporters
George W. Bush,"October 09, 2001",Remarks Following Discussions With Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder of Germany and an Exchange With Reporters,"The President. It's been my honor to welcome a great friend of America to the Oval Office again. Chancellor Schroeder came to talk about our war against terrorist activities. We had a great discussion.
First, I want to thank the Chancellor for his solidarity with the American people and his strong statement of support for the American people right after the evildoers struck on September the 11th. I also want to thank Chancellor Schroeder and the German people for their outpouring of support for the victims.
And I also want to thank him for being a steadfast friend in a broad coalition that is determined to rout terrorism out where it may exist, to not only bring the Al Qaida organization to justice but to declare a broad campaign against terrorists and terrorism all across the world. There is no more steadfast friend in this coalition than Germany, and I'm proud to have him here.
We also talked about the Middle East and the importance that both of us recognize for that process to get into Mitchell as quickly as possible. The German Government has been very strong about working with both parties in the Middle East to get into Mitchell. I assured him we're doing the same thing. There would be no better stabilizer for our coalition than for the Mitchell process to begin in the Middle East.
But Mr. Chancellor, we're so thrilled to have you here. Thank you for coming.
Chancellor Schroeder. Thank you very much, indeed, Mr. President. I, obviously, very happily came here. And I'm pleased to be here, because it is important to us to show that—very much in these difficult times—friendship must prevail and does prevail. And I'm also here to express the deepest solidarity from the German side, which is not just words being said, but it's a fact.
We very much are in agreement about the fact that this fight against terrorism, which we are all involved in by now, must be a very comprehensive approach, indeed. The action that is being taken right now must be added to through political measures, through diplomatic action, too.
We also find it very important to maintain the strong degree of cohesion that we see at this point in time within the antiterror alliance that has formed around the world. We went on to agree that it was crucially important to dry up the financing for the terrorists. And we also find it very important to highlight that the action that is presently being taken in Afghanistan is not at all directed against the people of Afghanistan; it is not at all directed against Islam; it is far rather directed against Usama bin Laden and the very ruthless regime behind him.
We have also very strongly emphasized how important we find it that we do provide relief for the refugees and cope with the refugee problem that will arise. And I can only yet again emphasize the high degree of respect that I feel vis-a-vis the United States of America and the American President, how he has gone about linking humanitarian aid and assistance up with the strike in this fantastic way he has done.
The President. Thank you, sir.
Military Action in Afghanistan/German Contribution
Q. Mr. President, how close are we to using U.S. ground troops in Afghanistan? And Mr. Chancellor, what extra commitments did you make of German military assets today to the United States cause?
The President. Well, first, I think the American people are beginning to realize that this is a unique type of war. The first shot we took in this war against terrorism was when we started cutting off their money. And I want to thank the German Chancellor and the German Government for cooperating and joining with us in not only sharing information but making it clear to Al Qaida and other terrorist groups, we're going to cut you off financially.
Secondly, as you know, we've started conventional operations. And I believe Secretary Rumsfeld summed it up pretty well today when he made it clear that the skies were now free for U.S. planes to fly without being harassed in any way and that the missions have been successful.
And as to whether or not we will put troops on the ground, I'm not going to tell you. I think it's—you've got to understand, we will not share intelligence, nor will we talk about military plans that we may or may not have in the future.
Chancellor Schroeder. I have—and you might remember me saying that—never excluded military contributions coming from the Federal Republic of Germany. We most obviously addressed this topic today. But as you might easily understand, it would be entirely unhelpful to spread this type of information. It would only help the enemy that we're trying to bring down. It is obvious that at the given point in time, details will be discussed in all friendship, and we'll come to good decisions.
Intelligence Briefings/Anthrax Exposures
Q. Mr. President, can you tell us what prompted you to write the memo to Congress about briefing on intelligence matters, why you think such restrictions are appropriate? And could you also address what threat you think these limited anthrax exposures pose more generally? Is it linked to terrorism at all?
The President. Well first, Mr. Chancellor, we had a—we had some security briefings take place up on Capitol Hill that were a discussion about classified information, and some of that information was shared with the press.
Chancellor Schroeder. Oh, we know that trouble. [Laughter]
The President. Oh, you know that trouble, too. [Laughter]
These are extraordinary times. Our Nation has put our troops at risk. And therefore, I felt it was important to send a clear signal to Congress that classified information must be held dear, that there's a responsibility, that if you receive a briefing of classified information you have a responsibility. And some Members did not accept that responsibility—somebody didn't. So I took it upon myself to notify the leadership of the Congress that I intend to protect our troops.
And that's why I sent the letter I sent. It's a serious matter, Dave [David Gregory, NBC News]; it's very serious that people in positions of responsibility understand that they have a responsibility to people who are being put in harm's way.
I'm having breakfast tomorrow with Members of Congress. I will be glad to bring up this subject. I understand there may be some heartburn on Capitol Hill. But I suggest if they want to relieve that heartburn, that they take their positions very seriously and that they take any information they've been given by our Government very seriously, because this is serious business we're talking about.
And the second question about anthrax, that is serious as well. I want to first tell the American people that an incident obviously came up, in the form of a sick male who unfortunately passed away. And the local authorities, along with the CDC, responded very quickly. There is a system in place to notify our Government and governments in the case of some kind of potential biological incident or chemical incident. And the system worked. And now the system is even working better, because we have, in essence, gone into the building, cleaned the building out, taken all the samples as possible, and are following any trail, any possible trail.
So thus far, it looks like it's a very isolated incident. But any—any type of incident, any type of information that comes into our Government, we take very seriously, because we understand we're dealing with evil people. And as you know, I've assured the American people that life should go on as normal. But they also should know, the American people should know, that our Government is doing everything we can to make our country as safe as possible.
Steve [Steve Holland, Reuters].
Military Action in Afghanistan
Q. Mr. President, the Pakistani President says he was told that the bombing campaign would be relatively short. How long do you think it will take? And what do you say to some of these people in the Islamic world who are protesting the campaign?
The President. Yes. Well, Steve, I don't know who told the Pakistani President that. Generally, you know, we don't talk about military plans. And there is one way to shorten the campaign in Afghanistan, and that's for the—Usama bin Laden and his leadership to be turned over so they can be brought to justice.
We will have a sustained effort. But I want to remind you that this is a part of a larger effort, that our war, the war of freedom-loving people, such as the Germans and the Americans, is against terrorists as a whole. And this is one part of a large campaign. We—the coalition has arrested over 200 people that have been associated with the Al Qaida organization. All around the world, freedom-loving people are gathering information, sharing information, and bringing people to justice.
And what was the second part of your question?
Protests in Islamic Nations
Q. The Islamic protesters. What do you say to those people?
The President. I say that if they think that the—first of all, I think the message of the Al Qaida organization is one of evil and hate. I understand people's willingness to protest, but they should not protest the decisions our coalition is making, because it is in the best interests of freedom and humankind.
Al Qaida and Nations Supporting Terrorism
Q. Do you still want him dead or alive?
The President. Ours is a compassionate nation, as is Germany. We're both combining our resources to help people in need. There are thousands of starving Afghans, because there is a Taliban Government in place that has caused starvation and deprivation and discrimination. And they are now housing terrorists. And make no mistake about it: The doctrine that says if you house a terrorist, you're just as guilty as a terrorist, will stand. We're making that very evident to the world as we speak.
Q. Do you still want Mr. bin Laden dead or alive, sir?
The President. I want there to be justice. I want there to be justice. And it's Al Qaida, but it's anybody who feeds Al Qaida, who houses Al Qaida, who encourages Al Qaida. Any other terrorist organization that is affiliated with Al Qaida is just as guilty, as far as I'm concerned.
We're very patient people. The American people understand, and I know that the Chancellor understands, that this is a different kind of war. There's a certain sense of fascination with previous wars in Kosovo and Desert Storm, where people could turn on their TV screens and see high-tech weaponry burrowing into bunkers and massive explosions. This is a different type of war. There will be a conventional component to the conflict, but much of what takes place will never make it onto the TV screens. Much of the efforts that we talked about in the Oval Office will be efforts that you will never see until people are brought to justice. And therefore, there has to be a certain patience. I think the American people are beginning to understand that.
I will assure you that the people—the terrorists of the world will understand that I am determined and, having talked with the Chancellor, that he is determined to lend the resources of our Government to bring them to justice. If it takes one day, one month, one year, or one decade, we're patient enough, because we understand that the actions we take together are not only important for today but will say to future Chancellors or future Presidents, ""Here is how we fight terrorism."" We also understand the actions we take today will make it more likely that our children's children will be able to grow up in a free world.
The first shot of the new war of the 21st century was fired September the 11th. The first battle is being waged, but it's only one of a long series of battles.
Yes, Bill [Bill Plante, CBS News].
Domestic Reaction
Q. Mr. President, as you noted on Sunday, there's a certain amount of nervous anxiety in the Nation, fear of new attacks, now that the military campaign has begun. Will the new Office of Homeland Security do anything concrete to recommend to average people, that they can do to protect themselves?
The President. Well, Bill, I think the— you know, the people of America should go about their business, should go about their daily lives, knowing full well that our Government, at all levels, is doing everything we can to disrupt any potential action and/or to provide the security necessary for people to travel, for example. I'm briefed every single morning about what somebody may or may not have heard and what actions are taking place. And their Government is responding as forcefully and actively as humanly possible.
One of the reasons why this coalition is so important is because we share information. When Germany hears something about something that may take place here and vice versa, we share information. And so, we're on high alert at the governmental level.
But the American people should go about their business. And people ought to travel. And people ought to feel comfortable going to see the mighty Houston Astros play. People ought to feel comfortable going about their lives, knowing that their Government is doing everything humanly possible to disrupt any potential activity that the evil ones may try to inflict upon us.
Intelligence Briefings
Q. Mr. President, when you meet with the congressional leadership tomorrow, will you be specific about what they can and cannot relay back up to the Hill? Or do you just expect them not to relay anything?
The President. Well, I'm going to talk to the leaders about this. I have talked to them about it. I mean, when the classified information first seeped into the public, I called them on the phone and said, ""This can't stand. We can't have leaks of classified information. It's not in our Nation's interests.""
But we're now in extraordinary times. And I was in the—when those leaks occurred, by the way, it was right before we committed troops. And I knew full well what was about to happen. And yet, I see in the media that somebody, or somebodies, feel that they should be able to talk about classified information. And that's just wrong. The leadership understands that.
And if there's concerns, we'll work it out. I mean, obviously I understand there needs to be some briefings. I want Don Rumsfeld to feel comfortable briefing members of the Armed Services Committee. But I want Congress to hear loud and clear: It is unacceptable behavior to leak classified information when we have troops at risk.
I'm looking forward to reiterating that message. And we will work together. We've got a great relationship. Listen, the four leaders, with whom I have breakfast on a weekly basis, fully understand the stakes. They fully understand the decision I made. And they will have gotten feedback from their Members, and we will discuss it. But one thing is for certain: I have made clear what I expect from Capitol Hill when it comes to classified information.
Chancellor Schroeder. Let me add something. I hope that the German press corps did hear it. [Laughter]
President Vladimir Putin of Russia
Q. We did hear it, Mr. Chancellor. Mr. President, do you consider Russia's war in Chechnya to be, first, a war against terrorists? And has your view on that changed since September 11th?
The President. I've had very good conversations with Vladimir Putin about the war on terrorism. I know the Chancellor has, as well. I'm, as a matter of fact, going to be meeting with the President of Russia within 2 weeks, in Shanghai, and I'm looking forward to those meetings.
I have made it clear to him that I appreciate his strong statements about America's efforts and the coalition's efforts to fight terrorism where we find it. I also made it clear to him that he needs to respect minority rights within his country. And he listened very carefully, and I think he's appreciative that our message has been consistent. From the very first conversation I had with President Putin, I expressed concern about how his government was viewing the minority that exists and how they were being treated. So my position has been very consistent.
To the extent that there's Al Qaida organizations in his neighborhood, they need to be brought to justice, as well. And we look forward to sharing information with him, just like he's sharing information with us. He is—he was one of the first—I will tell you an interesting story.
I was airborne on Air Force One and put our—on September the 11th—and put our troops to a high-alert status. And one of the first phone calls I got through my national security office was from Vladimir Putin, announcing that he has stood his troops down—which is significant. In the old days, if we'd have put our troops on heightened alert, they would have put their troops on more heightened alert—[laughter]—which would have caused our troops to go on higher alert. And all of a sudden we would have had a conflict, a potential conflict out of the realm of the incident that caused the troops to go on alert.
So he quickly called and said, ""We're standing our troops down."" It's a new attitude toward relationship. He understands the cold war is over, and so do I, which provides great opportunity for not only America but Germany to work with Mr. Putin for our nations' interests and his nation's interests.
And I think we're going to find a lot of common ground, one of which will be to fight terrorism. But as I explained to him, it's going to be hard to have common ground if he represses the press and/or treats minorities within his own country in a way that the Western world simply doesn't understand.
Listen, thank you all for coming. Thank you, Chancellor. I appreciate you, sir.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-following-discussions-with-chancellor-gerhard-schroeder-germany-and-exchange-2
George W. Bush,"October 15, 2001","Press Briefing by National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, on the APEC Meeting","The James S. Brady Briefing Room
1:22 P.M. EDT
DR. RICE: Good afternoon. I'm here to do my traditional pre-brief of the President's trip. He is, as you know, headed to Shanghai for a meeting of APEC. And this provides a unique opportunity for President Bush to meet personally with 20 Pacific Rim leaders, including key allies.
Despite the press of the urgent business that we have in the war against terrorism, the President feels that this is an extremely important trip and an extremely important time to take this trip. His objectives are very important for it. Obviously, he will continue to build the coalition in the war on terrorism in listing Pacific Rim leaders in his counterterrorism efforts.
We've had excellent cooperation from the leaders that he will meet there, and so this will give him an opportunity to review where we are and to continue those efforts.
The President also feels strongly -- as you know, it's been a slowing global economy, and so this is an opportunity to spur, through discussions with key leaders there, strong economic global recovery and what can be done to do that. And obviously a part of that is the very important trade agenda that these leaders share. And, finally, he will have a chance for the long run to strengthen some of our most important alliances.
He regrets that he will not be able to go on to Beijing, to Tokyo and to Seoul as had been planned, but he will have bilateral meetings in Shanghai with those three leaders and with a number of other leaders, as well -- with Singapore, Malaysia, Peru and Brunai, and also with President Putin of Russia.
Of course, we're going to see our other friends while we're there, as well -- Australia, Philippines, Thailand and the others.
So let me open it up for questions. John.
Q:Condi, you said the President wants to go. But is it appropriate for the President to be leaving on such a long-distance trip at this particular point? And was there any discussion among his advisors as to whether or not it was prudent for him to go at this time?
DR. RICE: Well, John, of course, it was discussed. But the President feels very strongly, as he said to the American people, that we have to go about the business of doing what makes America strong. And he believes that one of his most important tasks as President is to work on strengthening our alliances, as I said, to work on the global economic issues here, to continue to build the coalition against terrorism. He believes he can do that best by going to APEC.
He will be in constant touch with his advisors here in Washington; in fact, Secretary Powell, of course, will be with us. And he expects to have frequent contact with people back here. But he feels it's very important to go ahead and make this trip.
Ron.
Q:Can I follow up on that and tell us how this trip will help you build your coalition on terrorism? How much of the trip will be dominated by what's going on here in the U.S.?
DR. RICE: When the President was first elected, he talked about the importance of strengthening alliances, of building relationships that you could draw on when crises came along; that you couldn't simply have relationships in which you've made the first call when there is a difficult circumstance. And, fortunately, with all of these leaders, he had built those relationships so that when September 11th happened he had almost immediate reaction from all of these leaders.
Now this will give him an opportunity, face-to-face with some of them, to continue to talk about what can be done on the war on terrorism. For instance, with Japan, when Prime Minister Koizumi was here, we talked a lot about the financial issues, talked a lot about relief efforts. I'm sure he'll want to continue to talk about those. The Chinese have been very helpful on the information-sharing side, and we'll want to continue to talk about those efforts. So it's a whole panoply in what is a very, of course, large-scale and broad-scale attack on terrorism. And so he'll talk about those issues.
Q:If I could follow up, how about with Putin and Chechnya and how that has evolved?
DR. RICE: Well, he has a broad agenda, of course, with President Putin. Again, the President had said that it was time to move beyond the Cold War to a new relationship with Russia. I think September 11th demonstrated the tremendous possibilities of that new relationship. We have been in very close discussions with the Russians; he'll talk with the Russians -- with the Russian President about the broad agenda, but also, of course, about counterterrorism.
And on Chechnya, the President has been clear that our policies continue to be concerned about human rights issues, to be concerned about minority rights issues; but to make certain that we also say to the Chechan leadership that a political solution is important to this. It is important for legitimate Chechan leadership to make sure that there are no international terrorists among them.
Q:You will be granting an interview, we understand, this afternoon to Al Jazeera.
DR. RICE: That's right.
Q:Can you give us some idea how long it will last, when it will it be aired? I understand you're taping it. And is this part of a new public diplomacy by the White House? And will the President do one also?
DR. RICE: Well, I'm going to do Al Jazeera; I believe Secretary Powell did last week, and there are a number of other officials who will. I'm sorry, I don't remember the details of how long this will be -- I assume 20-30 minutes -- or when it will air. But we do think it's important that we get our message out to Arab publics, and we know that this is a network that is very popular with Arab publics.
I hope to be able to talk to the message that the President has been delivering, that this is a war on terrorism, a war on evil, this is not a war of civilizations. The President has enormous respect, and all of us do, for Islam, for a religion that preaches peace, that would never countenance the violent deaths of innocent people. And I hope to get that word across. So that's why we're doing it.
Q:And is the President contemplating?
DR. RICE: We have not discussed this with the President. I'm going to do it; Secretary Powell has done it. We'll see what else happens.
Campbell.
Q:You asked the networks last week to use careful consideration before broadcasting the messages that were coming from al Qaeda and from bin Laden. At the time you said that you had people who were analyzing these for possibly secret-coded messages. What have the analysts found in --
DR. RICE: The analysts continue to look at these messages, Campbell, and they are continuing to see what we can learn from them. The point to the networks -- and let me just say that I think the networks have been very responsible in the way that they have dealt with this -- my message to them was that it's not to me to judge news value of something like this, but it is to say that there's a national security concern about an unedited, 15 or 20-minute spew of anti-American hatred that ends in a call to go out and kill Americans. And I think that that was fully understood.
We are still concerned about whether there might be some signaling in here, but I don't have anything more for you on that yet.
Q:Any specific phrases, or anything that you're concerned about that you think may, in fact, be signaling?
DR. RICE: We're doing the analysis. I can't promise you that we'll be able to talk about what we think may be there, but I can tell you that I don't have anything for you right now on that.
April.
Q:Could you give us the mechanisms here at the White House that you're taking in reference to these letters that are coming with anthrax? And, also, could you update us a little bit more on the situation, since that is under the auspices of national security?
DR. RICE: Well, in fact, it's under the auspices of Tom Ridge and Homeland Security. We're in constant contact together about it. Let me just repeat that there are just, so far still, the two confirmed cases of anthrax; several other strongly suspected cases. I think it's fair to say that we've had unprecedented cooperation between the CDC, the FBI, local and state officials to try to deal with these issues.
There also, of course, is concern about this mail that is coming in, and every case is being taken very seriously, every case is being examined. I'm not going to talk about security precautions that we take in any particular place. I think it really isn't good to broadcast what we do, but just to say that, like everybody else, we're being very cautious about what we open. The American people ought to be cautious about what they open. There is absolutely no reason for panic, but if the American people, anyone is suspicious about a package or letter, then they should get in touch with officials about it.
Helen.
Q:Does this mean now that the United States will sign the new provisions of a germ warfare-biological warfare treaty, which you have renounced?
DR. RICE: Helen, I think that anyone who really thinks that the biological weapons protocol as it is currently drafted would stop the likes of people that we're worried about right now from getting biological weapons would have to really think twice. We do not believe that the protocol as it currently exists, that this protocol serves the interests of the United States or anyone else that is trying to stop the spread of biological weapons.
We're working with our allies to think about ways that we might strengthen the regime against these weapons, but inspection continues to be a huge problem because these are easy to hide. That really has not changed.
Q:Can I follow up in terms of, do you see any link, any conspiracy in these anthrax letters, per se? And do you think it comes from outside the nation here, or -- and also, we negotiated these provisions that you are now rejecting.
DR. RICE: Helen, there has been concern about this particular protocol for some time. I don't think that the administration made any secret about the fact that we don't think that this protocol will contribute to the fight against biological weapons. It is an issue that we take very seriously and we're working with our allies on measures that might, but the protocol that is currently out there we do not think would help.
Now, on the issue of whether these are linked, we do not know. And we are continuing to investigate and we're continuing to try to put the picture together. I think, as the Vice President said, obviously one has to be suspicious that there might be some links here. But all that we can do is to continue to investigate and continue to try to put the pieces together.
Q:On a couple of issues; first to follow up on Helen. Is it your assessment that an anthrax -- the use of anthrax this way would require state sponsorship of some degree to get to this level? And then, second, the President last week said he was amazed at the level of hatred that's in the Arab world, and you just said it's important to reach the Arab public through this popular means.
DR. RICE: Yes.
Q:Why isn't the President doing Al Jazeera then? And what will he and you do to meet that challenge?
DR. RICE: Let's not go to whether he is or is not. At this point, he is not. There's nothing scheduled at this point. Look, there is a lot of propaganda about America and America's goals that is out there. And we recognize that we have to do a better job of countering that propaganda. I think that if the people in the Arab world were able to see the pictures of these American women, Christians and Jews, carrying women who take the veil to do their shopping so that they wouldn't have to be fearful, I think that if word can get out that the President has asked that American children do something for Afghan children, I think that if the word can get out to remind people that America has gone -- used force to save the lives of Muslims against Serbs in Kosovo, or to save the lives of Muslims in Kuwait or in Bosnia, that these are messages that need to get out.
I would caution who -- the notion that all of the Arab world hates us, though. These demonstrations are still thousands of people in countries where there are millions of people. And I think that there's a deep wellspring of respect and, indeed, Americans are liked. So we need to tap into that. There are clearly extremists who hate America, but we need to tap into, I think, the broad populations of these countries that have reason to admire and to like Americans.
Q:And then on state sponsorship?
DR. RICE: We don't know enough, I think, about these incidents yet to answer what kind of resources people would have had to have.
Q:The weaponized answer?
DR. RICE: I don't think we know very -- oh, to weaponize anthrax?
Q:Of the samples that have been taken so far, any evidence that they are weaponized forms of anthrax?
DR. RICE: I think we don't have any evidence of that at this point; but we're continuing to investigate.
Q:Condi, on two of the Asian leaders you'll be meeting. First, in the Philippines there was discussion that at some point we might send in trainers, special forces, something like that as sort of the first new front that you would open up here. Can you tell us a little bit about that?
And for China, the Chinese leadership has already been talking, equating terrorists with separatists -- Falun Gong, Tibet, hinted Taiwan. Is the President prepared to address this and what is he going to say?
DR. RICE: It is clearly our job, David, to make certain that we continue to draw a line in all of our discussions between legitimate dissent or legitimate movements for the rights of minorities and the fact that there may be international terrorists in various parts of the world. We've done that in the situation in Chechnya; we would do that in our discussions with the Chinese.
But we really do believe that people understand that there is a global network out there, an international network that has cells in so many countries that we really have to sit down with the leaders of those countries and determine how we can get them out. And that leads me to the Philippines. That story I think does not represent the level of thinking in the administration about any such thing.
But what we do want to do, though, is to work with every government in which there is a substantial al Qaeda presence to figure out a strategy for rooting it out. Because it's like cutting out a cancer now in 60-plus countries. You've got to get to these cells and root them out and disrupt them before they strike again. And we will certainly have that discussion with the Philippine --
Q:But you're not planning to send American personnel to the Philippines --
DR. RICE: I'm not going to comment on what we might do. But we will certainly have this discussion with the Philippine leadership on how we can address the al Qaeda threat, which clearly is there in the Philippines.
Q:On a day when suspicious mail got to the Senate, has there been any suspicious mail here? Any cause for concern at the White House?
DR. RICE: I really can't comment. Not that I know of. Not that I know of.
Q:Your interview with Al Jazeera, last week you asked U.S. broadcast outlets to be cautious, not to broadcast full statements, propaganda by Osama bin Laden. And Al Jazeera does this regularly. And it's seen in the U.S. over satellite networks. Have you made a request of the satellite network, will you make a request to Al Jazeera not to allow, not to disseminate this hate?
DR. RICE: My understanding is that Al Jazeera, of its own accord, has adopted some guidelines on how it might use these tapes. Let me be very clear on what it was that we were discussing. When you have these unedited tapes that are pre-taped, shipped some place, for 15, 20 minutes, with no commentary, you know, I think news organizations would be suspicious or skeptical of doing that with anybody.
And to do it with groups that are known terrorists, known killers who sit and use that tape then to incite people to go out and kill Americans, that was the discussion that we had. It's not an effort to keep information from anybody, it's just the nature of that particular vehicle.
Q:And the satellite channels that rebroadcast Al Jazeera, did you make the request of them --
DR. RICE: We've not talked to the satellite channels, we've felt that we could deal with this principally in the way that we have.
Q:Dr. Rice, given all the focus on coalition-building and the events on September 11th, is there still an appetite in your shop with Gary Edson and with others, is there still an appetite for the economic and trade issues that would normally dominate an APEC conference? Or aren't they just going to disappear?
DR. RICE: No, we're not going to let them disappear. The President feels very strongly that he has a responsibility to -- you know that he's thought a lot about the American economy -- well, the American economy can't be considered in isolation from the global economy. And, certainly, the issues of global economic growth, the kinds of discussions that we might have, for instance with Japan, the importance of trade to global economic growth -- the President is very devoted to that agenda.
He's going to be talking with people today about trade promotion authority. He really feels very strongly that that's an agenda that's got to keep going because, ultimately, stability and the kind of, if you will, quarantine against some of this will come from a stronger, more prosperous world.
Q:If I'm asked about Japan's role in this international coalition, Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armacost told the Japanese officials to, ""show the flag,"" meaning the Japanese government should be involved fully in this campaign against terrorism.
Now, Dr. Rice, have you seen the Japanese flag in this coalition, especially when Prime Minister Koizumi decided to send self-defense forces to provide logistical support for the U.S. military? And how important is Japan's action in this campaign in developing long-term strategic relationship between Japan and the United States?
DR. RICE: Yes, we are gratified by the response that we've gotten from Japan on the military side, where we recognize that there are important limitations that Japan imposes on itself, in terms of its constitutional responsibilities, and that's fine. But Japan has found very important ways to help with logistical support, with all kinds of support for the military effort. And we're really gratified by that.
We know that Prime Minister Koizumi has rallied his own nation to support this Japanese role. And we believe that it will have a long-term benefit to stability and peace in the Asia-Pacific.
Q:You see the Japanese flag, don't you?
DR. RICE: Well, the Japanese flag is alive and well in this coalition. I can't say that I know where it's showing, but I can tell you that it's extremely important. We're very pleased with the response.
Q:Dr. Rice, when you talk about the need for communication with the Arab world in terms of American goals and American culture, when the President goes to the APEC meeting, he would have an opportunity to try to recruit some of these leaders from that part of the world into that sort of message campaign. Will he do that? Is that one of his goals?
DR. RICE: It's an excellent point. It's an excellent point, because among the APEC leaders, of course, are leaders of important Muslim countries. And we do think that the President is -- that it's important to enlist Muslim leaders not just in the Middle East, but from around the world, to understand that this is clearly not a war of religions, not a war with the Muslim world.
These leaders understand the threat of terrorism perhaps even better than we Americans do. They know that terrorists are after the stability of their countries as well, these extremists. And so we believe we have common cause with them and that we can work toward a common understanding.
Q:And how --
DR. RICE: I think it will be broad. He'll talk all about this. But as you know, he's already talked with Ms. Megawati, President Megawati of Indonesia, he's been on the phone with Mahathir in Malaysia. He's had a lot of contacts in this regard.
Q:I just wanted to explore -- forgive me if you've already addressed this -- on a potential link to bin Laden and these anthrax cases so far. The President, in a way that was significant, said that there is some possible link, there's no hard evidence, but a possible link. Can you explain what leads him, you, others, to believe that link may exist?
DR. RICE: It's simply at this point to not rule it out. Secondly, just circumstantially one has to worry that there may be some sort of link because of the timing here. There isn't any hard evidence of a link of any kind, but we don't want to be blind to that link; it would be hard to be blind to that link, given what happened on September 11th, but there isn't any hard evidence at this point.
Q:Can I just ask, following when the President was asked in the Rose Garden, if you have anything to say about reports of the Indian army firing against Pakistani positions across the cease-fire line? And then I have another --
DR. RICE: We've just seen the reports of this. As you know, Secretary Powell is actually in Islamabad and he's there with the express purpose, both in Islamabad and in Delhi, to talk with and to counsel with the leaders of Pakistan and India on the importance of stability in the zone of control, importance of not having a flair up in Kashmir.
I can tell you that there were quite a few phone calls over the weekend -- a weekend ago, not this past weekend, but the weekend before -- concerning this issue. As we got ready to get ready for military action, the President talked to Prime Minister Vajpayee. He, of course, talked to President Musharraf. Colin Powell also talked to both. I talked to my counterparts. There's been a lot of back-and-forth. I think we'll have to go and see what's actually happening here; the reports are pretty preliminary. But there is a lot of diplomatic infrastructure in place to try to damp this down.
Q:Can I follow up?
DR. RICE: Sorry, the President is about to speak. I do not want to get in his way. Thanks a lot.

George W. Bush,"November 13, 2001",The President's News Conference With President Vladimir Putin of Russia,"President Bush. It's a great honor for me to welcome President Vladimir Putin to the White House and to welcome his wife as well. This is a new day in the long history of Russian-American relations, a day of progress and a day of hope.
The United States and Russia are in the midst of a transformation of a relationship that will yield peace and progress. We're transforming our relationship from one of hostility and suspicion to one based on cooperation and trust that will enhance opportunities for peace and progress for our citizens and for people all around the world.
The challenge of terrorism makes our close cooperation on all issues even more urgent. Russia and America share the same threat and the same resolve. We will fight and defeat terrorist networks wherever they exist. Our highest priority is to keep terrorists from acquiring weapons of mass destruction.
Today we agreed that Russian and American experts will work together to share information and expertise to counter the threat from bioterrorism. We agreed that it is urgent that we improve the physical protection and accounting of nuclear materials and prevent illicit nuclear trafficking. And we will strengthen our efforts to cut off every possible source of biological, chemical, and nuclear weapons, materials, and expertise. Today we also agreed to work more closely to combat organized crime and drug trafficking, a leading source of terrorist financing.
Both nations are committed to the reconstruction of Afghanistan, once hostilities there have ceased and the Taliban are no longer in control. We support the U.N.'s efforts to fashion a post-Taliban government that is broadly based and multiethnic. The new government must export neither terror nor drugs, and it must respect fundamental human rights.
As Russia and the United States work more closely to meet new 21st century threats, we're also working hard to put the threats of the 20th century behind us once and for all, and we can report great progress.
The current levels of our nuclear forces do not reflect today's strategic realities. I have informed President Putin that the United States will reduce our operationally deployed strategic nuclear warheads to a level between 1,700 and 2,200 over the next decade, a level fully consistent with American security.
Russia and the United States have also had vast discussions about our defensive capabilities, the ability to defend ourselves as we head into the 21st century. We have different points of view about the ABM Treaty, and we will continue dialog and discussions about the ABM Treaty, so that we may be able to develop a new strategic framework that enables both of us to meet the true threats of the 21st century as partners and friends, not as adversaries.
The spirit of partnership that now runs through our relationship is allowing the United States and Russia to form common approaches to important regional issues. In the Middle East, we agree that all parties must take practical actions to ease tensions so that peace talks can resume. We urge the parties to move without delay to implement the Tenet work plan and the Mitchell report recommendations.
In Europe, we share a vision of a European Atlantic community whole, free, and at peace, one that includes all of Europe's democracies, and where the independence and sovereignty of all nations are respected. Russia should be a part of this Europe.
We will work together with NATO and NATO members to build new avenues of cooperation and consultation between Russia and NATO. NATO members and Russia are increasingly allied against terrorism, regional instability, and other threats of our age. And NATO must reflect this alliance.
We're encouraged by President Putin's commitment to a political dialog in Chechnya. Russia has also made important strides on immigration and the protection of religious and ethnic minorities, including Russia's Jewish community. On this issue, Russia is in a fundamentally different place than it was during the Soviet era. President Putin told me that these gains for freedom will be protected and expanded. Our Foreign Ministers have sealed this understanding in an exchange of letters. Because of this progress, my administration will work with Congress to end the application of Jackson-Vanik amendment to Russia.
Russia has set out to strengthen free market institutions and the rule of law. On this basis, our economic relationship is developing quickly, and we will look for further ways to expand it.
A strong, independent media is a vital part of a new Russia. We've agreed to launch a dialog on media entrepreneurship, so that American and Russian media representatives can meet and make practical recommendations to both our Governments, in order to advance our goal of free media and free exchange of ideas.
Russia and the United States will continue to face complex and difficult issues. Yet, we've made great progress in a very short period of time. Today, because we are working together, both our countries and the world are more secure and safe. I want to thank President Putin for the spirit of our meetings. Together, we're making history, as we make progress.
Laura and I are looking forward to welcoming the Putins to our ranch in Crawford, Texas. I can't wait to show you my State and where I live. In the meantime, I hope you have a fine stay here in Washington, DC. And it's my honor to welcome you to the White House, sir, and welcome you to the podium.
President Putin. Ladies and gentlemen, I don't know whether I would have an opportunity to address such a representative audience of the press and media. I would like to begin, anyway, with words of thanks to the President of the United States, not only for his kind invitation to visit the United States and Washington but also for his very informal initiation of our negotiations earlier today. Myself and my colleagues are very pleased to be here, this historic building of the White House. And President Bush deemed it appropriate not only to tour me, to guide me through the premises of this house where he lives, he— saw almost every picture hanging on the walls of this great building. But it is not only very interesting, but it also changes for the better the quality of our relationship.
I would like to once again thank the President and the American people, and I would like to express our condolences in connection with the recent plane crash in the United States. As they say in Russia, tragedy does not come alone, and tragedies always come in many numbers. I am confident that the U.S.—American people would face this tragedy very bravely.
I would like to inform you that the Washington part of our negotiations is being completed, and our discussions proved very constructive, interesting, and useful and will continue at Crawford. But the preliminary results we evaluate as extremely positive.
This is our fourth meeting with President Bush in the last few months. I believe this is a vivid demonstration of the dynamic nature of the Russian-American relations. We have come to understand each other better, and our positions are becoming closer on the key issues of bilateral and international relations. We are prepared now to seek solutions in all areas of our joint activities. We intend to dismantle conclusively the vestiges of the cold war and to develop new—entirely new partnership for long term.
Of course, we discussed in detail the subject matter of fight against terrorism. The tragic developments of September the 11th demonstrated vividly the need for a joint effort to counter this global threat. We consider this threat as a global threat, indeed, and the terrorists and those who help them should know that the justice is inescapable, and it will reach them wherever they try to hide.
Also, post-crisis political settlement in Afghanistan was discussed. The most important thing for today is to return peace and the life in honor to Afghanistan, so that no threat originate from Afghanistan to the international stability. Of course, we do not intend to force upon the Afghani people the solutions; it is for them to resolve those issues with the active participation of the United Nations.
We discussed in detail our dialog related to strategic offensive and defensive weapons. Here, we managed to achieve certain progress. First of all, it has to do with the prospects of reaching a reliable and verifiable agreement on further reductions of the U.S. and Russian weapons.
Here I must say, we appreciate very much the decision by the President to reduce strategic offensive weapons to the limits indicated by him. And we, for our part, will try to respond in kind.
On the issues of missile defense, the position of Russia remains unchanged, and we agreed to continue dialog and consultations on this. I believe that it's too early now to draw the line under the discussions of these issues, and we will have an opportunity to continue the work on this—one of the very difficult issues—at the Crawford ranch.
We also exchanged on a number of topical issues of international importance, the Balkans, Iraq. And we reiterated in a joint statement the resolve of the United States and Russia to facilitate settlement in the Middle East and the early resumption of negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians.
We also discussed seriously the development of relations between Russia and NATO, including taking into account a changed international situation. We consider that there are opportunities for an entirely new mechanism, joint decisionmaking, and coordinated action in the area of security and stability.
We considered in detail a number of economic cooperation issues. The Russian-American dialog in this area has become recently more constructive and more tangible. Such major investment projects as Sakhalin I and Caspian Pipeline Consortium are gaining momentum. Successful is cooperation in the air-space, mining, chemistry, car building, and other industries. Direct contacts are expanding between entrepreneurs of the two countries, including within the Russian-American business dialog.
It is with satisfaction that we note a certain progress in issues related to the Russia's accession to the WTO, in recognizing Russia as a market economy country, and we've felt a great degree of understanding that such issues should be resolved, I mean, dealing with the Jackson-Vanik amendment, not de facto but in legal terms. And in this context, our Foreign Minister and the Secretary of State, Messrs. Ivanov and Powell, exchanged letters reiterating the resolve of Russia and the United States to observe human rights and religious freedoms.
Of course, the capabilities embedded in the bilateral relationship have not been fully implemented. The key—we have quite a lot of things to do, but we are confident that the success is, by and large, predetermined by our resolve to cooperate energetically and constructively. That, and I'm confident, would benefit both countries and which is reflected, also, in our visit to this country today.
Thank you.
Situation in Afghanistan
Q. Mr. President, welcome to the White House, sir. Mr. President, the Northern Alliance forces took over Kabul, and there are reports of executions of POWs and other violent reprisals. Can the Alliance be trusted to form a broad-based government? If not, what should happen next to stabilize Afghanistan, and what role, if any, should U.S. troops play in that political phase?
President Bush. First of all, we're making great progress in our objective, and that is to tighten the net and eventually bring Al Qaida to justice, and at the same time, deal with the Government that has been harboring them.
President Putin and I spent a lot of time talking about the Northern Alliance and their relationship to Kabul, as well as Mazar-e Sharif and other cities that have now been liberated from the Taliban. I made it very clear to him that we would continue to work with the Northern Alliance to make sure they recognized that in order for there to be a stable Afghanistan, which is one of our objectives, after the Taliban leaves, that the country be a good neighbor, that they must recognize that a future government must include a representative from all of Afghanistan.
We listened very carefully to the comments coming out of the Northern Alliance today. And they made it very clear they had no intention of occupying Kabul. That's what they said. I have seen reports, which you refer to, and I also saw a report that said, on their way out of town, the Taliban was wreaking havoc on the citizenry of Kabul. And if that be the case—I haven't had it verified one way or the other, but I wouldn't be the least bit surprised. After all, the Taliban has been wreaking havoc on the entire country for over a decade. This has been on of the most repressive regimes in the history of mankind. But we will continue to work with our Northern Alliance—with the Northern Alliance commanders to make sure they respect the human rights of the people that they are liberating.
I also saw reports—and I think President Putin mentioned this today as well—that in some of the northern cities, there was great joyous—a wonderful, joyous occasion as the citizens were free, free from repression, free from a dictatorial government. But we are both mindful, particularly mindful of the need for us to work with our Northern Alliance friends to treat people with respect.
President Putin. All our actions were aimed at liberating the northern parts of Afghanistan and the capital of Afghanistan, liberate from the Taliban regime. And any military action is accompanied not only by the military resistance but also an information resistance, what we are witnessing right now, exactly.
We tend to forget now the destruction of the cultural heritage of humankind. We tend to forget now the atrocities by Taliban. And we are talking less than usual of the Taliban harboring international terrorism. The information that Northern Alliance are shooting—are shooting the prisoners of war was launched a few days ago. The Northern Alliance was not in Kabul a few days ago; they were liberating northern parts of the country.
And for those who do not know, I will tell, the northern part of the country is inhabited by the ethnic groups represented in the Northern Alliance; I mean, Uzbeks and Tajiks. It is very difficult for me to imagine them shooting their own population. I utterly exclude this. If there are any instances in the course of the military action of the violation of human rights and treatment of the prisoners of war, we must investigate and take action. But we need proof.
Talking of this, we should not forget the things that we see: the way people meet advancing Northern Alliance troops, liberating the cities and villages of the Taliban; the women getting rid of chadors and burning them. And this, I would like you, ladies and gentlemen of the press, to pay attention to.
Thank you.
Possible Visit to Russia/Nuclear Arms Reduction
Q. Specific numbers were mentioned here with regard to the reductions of offensive weapons. When, and if at all, one could expect that such specific numbers made public be substantiated by some papers, maybe during a possible visit by President Bush to Moscow? And by the way, when could this visit take place?
President Bush. Got to get invited first. [Laughter]
Do you want to start?
President Putin. President Bush is aware of that, and I would like to reiterate: He has an open invitation to visit the Russian Federation, with an official working or a private visit, in any format, at any time convenient for him. I mean, the best time would be during the time of the beginning of the year, White Nights in St. Petersburg. [Laughter] Of course, the official part would start in Moscow, in the capital of the Russian Federation.
But as for the business part, I think that before that time, our advisers will continue working. And we, for our part, for the Russian part, are prepared to present all our agreements in a treaty form, including the issues of verification and control.
President Bush. I think it's interesting to note that a new relationship based upon trust and cooperation is one that doesn't need endless hours of arms control discussions. I can remember watching the news years ago and seeing that people would sit at tables for hours and hours and hours trying to reach reduced levels of nuclear armament.
My attitude is: Here's what we can live with. And so I've announced a level that we're going to—that we'll stick by. To me, that's how you approach a relationship that is changed and different. And we'd be glad to—and I looked the man in the eye and shook his hand, but if we need to write it down on a piece of paper, I'll be glad to do that. But that's what our Government is going to do over the next 10 years.
And we don't need an arms control agreement or an arms control—let me say this—we don't need arms control negotiations to reduce our weaponry in a significant way. And today you've now heard for the first time the level that I think is commensurate with the spirit of reducing our own weaponry and, at the same time, keeping the peace.
ABM Treaty
Q. You mentioned vast discussions on the ABM Treaty. What progress are you making? And are you convinced you won't have to withdraw from the treaty now?
President Bush. Well, I'm convinced that the treaty is outdated, and we need to move beyond it. And we're having discussions along those lines. We had good discussions today; we had good discussions in Shanghai; we had good discussions in Slovenia; and we'll have good discussions in Crawford. This is obviously a subject that's got a lot of ramifications to it. I clearly heard what the President has had to say and his view of the ABM Treaty. He's heard what I've had to say, and we'll continue working it.
But my position is, is that it is a piece of paper that's codified a relationship that no longer exists, codified a hateful relationship. And now we've got a friendly relationship. And I think we need to have a new strategic framework that reflects the new relationship, based upon trust and cooperation. But we'll continue to work it.
Freedom of the Press
Q. A question to President Bush. His advisers expressed concern over the situation with the freedom of speech in Russia. But after September 11th, it would seem to me that the situation is changing somewhat in the United States, too. There are special rules for covering anti-terrorist operation, bin Laden is denied any opportunity to present his views in the media— quite appropriately, in my view—and so on and so forth. The authority of the special services have been extended, and there have been rumors that some of your members of your administration went to Hollywood explaining to them a few things. Where is the line in the sand where—beyond which it is impossible to cross, delineating a voluntary restraint on the part of the media and——
President Bush. Yes. First of all, I have been trying to tame our press corps ever since I got into politics, and I've failed miserably. [Laughter] They get to express their opinions, sometimes in the form of news— [laughter]—any way they want to.
I asked them the other day, ""Would it be okay if I cut a 30-minute tape, a piece of propaganda? No questions. Just here— here it is; here's 30 minutes of me talking. Please run it not only across your airwaves but run it internationally, if you don't mind. I've got something to say about the conflict and our fight against evil."" They said, no, they're not going to do that. If I'm going to have to get on the news, they've got to ask me questions.
And so we extended the same courtesy to Usama bin Laden. He doesn't get to just cut a 30-minute tape, where he may be calling his soldiers to action, where he is definitely condemning all Jews, Christians, threatening individuals, to be able to put a 30-minute propaganda tape on the free airwaves. And we made that suggestion. We didn't dictate; we just suggested. And some of the news organizations—or all the news organizations readily agreed that was a responsible posture to take. And for that, I'm grateful.
But the press in America has never been stronger and never been freer and never been more vibrant—sometimes to my chagrin and a lot of times to my delight. But whoever thinks that I have the capability or my government has the capability of reining in this press corps simply doesn't understand the American way.
President Putin. I would also offer a couple of words. Today, giving a rostrum to international terrorists would be equal to giving an opportunity to—[inaudible]— newspapers of the Second World War times to—an opportunity to print Dr. Goebbels' articles. This question could be turned in the following way: What is the limit and what is the measure of giving an opportunity to the terrorists and destructive element to use media in pursuit of their antihuman, inhuman objectives? Let's look at it this way.
Situation in Afghanistan
Q. Yes, sir, Mr. President, thank you. If I could return to the situation in Afghanistan, where the concern seems to be a potential breakdown in civil order and a possible dramatic increase in civil conflict between the tribes in the Northern Alliance and other groups, which President Putin's country has experience with, what specifically can be done in the next several days to ensure the safety of the citizens of Kabul? And does the Northern Alliance, now that they've taken that city, enjoy pride of place at the bargaining table in the future of Afghanistan?
President Bush. There is no preferential place at the bargaining table. All people will be treated the same. That's what we're working with our friends the Russians on. That's the concept we're working on with the U.N. And that's only fair. That's been the vision all along. That's been the vision we talked about in Shanghai. It's the vision we have shared again today.
Secondly, I repeat, the Northern Alliance, with whom President Putin has got some influence and I've got some influence, has told us both they have no intention of occupying—and they've said this publicly—they intend not to occupy Kabul, which is fine. That's the way it ought to be. And we will continue to work with their commanders. We've got troops there with their commanders, and we will continue to urge restraint.
Again, I think before we jump to conclusions, we want to make sure we understand what the facts are, because the evacuating army has been one that has held this country—has terrorized this country for a long period of time. But any—regardless of that, any—any—army, advancing or retreating, needs to treat people with respect. And we will continue to work that they do so.
President Putin. Well, the thing is that the Northern Alliance did not take Kabul by storm. The Northern Alliance is looming over—has been looming over Kabul for a long time. That was our mutual agreement with President Bush. And suddenly, they discovered, all of a sudden, that Kabul had been abandoned, and they had to insert there certain security elements to prevent looting and robberies and murders. There was complete lawlessness in that city, and the situation must be put under control, and it was very difficult. It would be very difficult for us if we—to meet with the Northern Alliance leaders to tell them that they've negated their obligation.
The city of Kabul was abandoned by Taliban. They were trying to preserve their manpower and their equipment, a very cunning move on the part of Taliban. Maybe, technically, their decision was right, but we should not be deluded on that score. Quite a serious amount of work is still ahead. They did not disappear; they just moved out of the city, a few kilometers from there. And I am absolutely in agreement with the President on the need to follow the developments with a view to preventing abuses of human rights and maltreatment of the POWs, although the line we agreed upon has not been yet reached.
Dear colleagues, the final question.
Pakistan/Uzbekistan and Tajikistan
Q. Two questions to two Presidents. Mr. Bush, what is your evaluation of the situation in Pakistan, which was always in the sphere of influence of the United States, and whether there are any dangers that the forces up in opposition to General Musharraf would gain control of the nuclear weapons?
And to President Putin, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan made available their airbases and their air corridors to the United States Armed Forces, giving the green light. Can you tell us whether you gave a green light to that? Aren't you apprehensive of the struggle for power and influence in that area?
President Bush. I had a very good dinner with President Musharraf last Saturday night in New York City. It's the first time I had met him. My Secretary of State had met him in Pakistan, as had my Secretary of Defense and other officials in my administration. All of us came away with our respect for President Musharraf and our desire to make sure that his administration is successful in Pakistan.
The best way to make sure that terrorists do not end up with nuclear weaponry in that part of the world is for President Musharraf to provide a stable government and to fulfill what he said he would do, which is to have elections in a short period of time. And I believe he is—he deserves our Nation's support, and so we are putting together a economic package that will help him with debt, help him with the expenses of the ongoing operations, help him with trade. And we will continue a dialog with the Pakistan leader, with the full intent of finding ways we can cooperate, in order to bring stability to that part of the world.
President Putin. With regard to the possible redrawing of the spheres of influence and the enhanced American influence in the central Asia, I would like to say the following: I am more concerned with the presence of the terrorist training camps in the northern Afghanistan, who send guerrillas to the Caucasus—have been sending in the recent years. After Ahmed Shah Massoud was killed, I had a very, very sad feeling. That was prior to September 11th. And I told President Bush at that time that perhaps some serious developments are in the making. And this is concerning— this concerns me very much.
If we look at the relationship between the Russian Federation and the United States from the old standpoint, distrust and the enmity, that's one thing. If we are looking through the prism of partnership and alliance, we have nothing to be afraid of. This is one thing. Secondly, one shouldn't forget that both Uzbekistan and Tajikistan are independent states and decide, therefore, in policies independently, who cooperate with and at which level.
But focusing my attention at the following circumstance, and I related it to President Bush quite frankly—we've just mentioned President Musharraf. We all should support President Musharraf. This would be the right thing to do. And we agree with this, and we accept this. It is also true that American flags are being burned in the streets of the Pakistani cities; one should not leave that unnoticed.
In Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, the Muslim countries, too, American flags are not being burned. Moreover, those countries cooperate, for the first time, so openly and so consistently with the United States and with the international alliance against terrorism. Being Muslim countries with their own problems, none of them are squeaking or crying foul; they are trying to address their own problems on their own.
And in these conditions, the continued application of Jackson-Vanik amendment to Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, and so on and so forth, one wouldn't call it justified and just. We need to and want to build a new relationship in the new 21st century.
Thank you very much.
President Bush. Thank you.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-president-vladimir-putin-russia-0
George W. Bush,"February 01, 2002",Remarks by the National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice to the Conservative Political Action Conference,"Marriott Crystal GatewayArlington, Virginia
11:50 A.M. EST
DR. RICE: Well, thank you very much for that warm reception and for that terrific introduction, and I really appreciate. It's a great honor to speak to this group today. I'd very much like to thank David Keene, the Chairman of CPAC, and the leaders of the 70 co-sponsoring organizations for having me here to say a few words to you about the campaign on which we are engaged here in the United States of America, in Afghanistan, in every country in the world. This is truly a global campaign.
Organizations such as CPAC fill an invaluable role in our society. You are an incubator of ideas and a wellspring of energy that sustains the causes that we care about. And today, as free men and women who come together to foster change through honest debate, you represent the best in America, and it reminds us of the values for which we are fighting. You embody -- as America embodies -- the principles that are worth fighting to defend: Liberty, democracy, and pluralism.
I know that later this afternoon, you're going to talk to a panel about seismic shifts caused by September 11th. And those shifts were very much in evidence when the President addressed the state of our Union on Tuesday night.
Imagine for a moment that someone had sat you down on September 10th, placed a tape in your VCR and told you that, here's what the President's next State of the Union Address is going to sound like. Each of us placed in those circumstances would have reacted in two ways, both at the same time. As we heard him, and as we viewed the window through which we had just climbed, our stomachs would have churned with the knowledge that our nation and the world had suffered such a great catastrophe. And behind our veil of ignorance, we would have been driven and, in fact, reluctant at the same time to ask the questions, who and what and where and particularly why September 11th.
But second, our hearts would have been filled with enormous pride, knowing that a great nation once again had set its sights on great causes, that our defense of liberty is unabashed and unafraid and morally clear.
On September 10th, we could not have known that America would prove itself so stalwart in the face of such a great challenge. We could not have known that there could be so many countless acts of selflessness and outpouring to ease the suffering of our fellow citizens, and a renewed appreciation of the duties, the responsibilities and the privileges of citizenship. And we could barely have imagined the seismic shifts that were about to occur in international politics.
One of the most important and one of the most immediate shifts has been a renewed appreciation of American national power. Specifically, the importance of a powerful military used responsibly in the service of our values.
If you go back just a little while, there was a lot of speculation that the future of the American armed forces actually lay largely in so-called operations other than war, in policing civil and ethnic conflicts and in humanitarian missions. Well, I don't hear anybody saying that any more. (Applause.)
The fact is that there are real threats out there. Freedom still faces ruthless enemies. And America and its allies have to deter and, if necessary, defeat them.
Our military has done extraordinary things in the past four months. It has shown its power and its precision. It has fought an enemy unlike any we have faced in our history, and we've helped liberate a nation. It has really been extraordinary to witness from the inside, as those of you who have been watching from without have seen, what this military can do.
When we woke up on September 12th and began planning our response, I can tell you that the American military didn't exactly have an operational plan on the shelf, a template that said ""Afghanistan Campaign."" We especially didn't have a template on the shelf that said, your ground forces are going to be on horseback -- (laughter) -- your 19th century ground forces with your 21st century air power.
And the President was making clear to those who were planning the campaign every day that he wanted the use of American military force to be meaningful and effective. He was not going to use pinpricks to deal with the circumstances in which we found ourselves. (Applause.)
He understood immediately that only the decisive use of American military power maintains our credibility. But he also told people that we weren't going to respond rashly or do something just for the sake of doing something.
In a very short time frame, we did have a campaign plan for Afghanistan. It was a plan that was daring in conception and difficult in execution. It was truly outside the box, and eventually it was successful. It was successful because the way was paved by strong diplomacy. It was successful because we had a President who was determined and focused and patient. It was successful because we had a commander-in-chief who let his military do the job. (Applause.)
And it was successful because our military forces are the strongest and best equipped and most professional in the history of the world. (Applause.)
Tuesday night, the world saw the President resolve to ensure that our forces remain without peer. He will ask in his budget for an additional $48 billion for our armed forces, the single largest increase since Ronald Reagan was President. And, as President Bush said Tuesday night, while the price of freedom and security is high, it is never too high. Whatever it costs to defend our nation, we will pay it. (Applause.)
As a result of our resolve, the Taliban regime has been routed and all that remains of it is remnant. Afghanistan is no longer a terrorist-sponsored state but, rather, a state that is trying to make its way to a better future for its people.
But al Qaeda is far from finished. It operates in dozens of countries around the world and it threatens many more. And the President has made clear that we and our allies will not rest until the threat from al Qaeda and the network itself is no more. (Applause.)
We will pursue its members by every means at our disposal. We will disrupt its plans, destroy its bases, arrest its members, break up its cells and choke off its finances. And our enemy is not just al Qaeda, but every terrorist group of global reach. This is not just our struggle; it is the struggle of the civilized world.
The United States has made clear to leaders on every continent that there is no such thing as a good terrorist and a bad terrorist. You cannot condemn al Qaeda and hug Hamas. (Applause.)
The United States draws no distinction between the terrorists and the regimes that feed, train, supply and harbor them. Simply put, harboring terrorists isn't a very good business to be in right now. (Applause.)
Now, many nations are trying hard to do the right thing, to improve their border security, to enforce their laws, to improve their ability to track terrorists in their movements and finances. And the United States is actively helping countries to improve their immune systems against terrorism.
On the other hand, there are some who, shall we say, are not moving with alacrity to shut down terror within their borders. They have been put on notice.
The President also put the world on notice on Tuesday night, that our nation will do everything in its power to deny the world's most dangerous powers the world's most dangerous weapons. It is a stubborn and extremely troubling fact that the list of states that sponsor terror and the lists that are seeking to acquire weapons of mass destruction happens to overlap substantially. And we know that if an al Qaeda type organization were to come into possession of a weapon of mass destruction, they would have no hesitation to use it.
In his State of the Union, the President was crystal clear about the growing danger posed by such states as North Korea, Iran and Iraq that pursue weapons of mass destruction. The President is calling on the world, on our friends and our allies, to join us in preventing these regimes from developing and deploying these weapons, either directly or through stateless terrorist surrogates. This is a serious matter and it requires a serious response.
North Korea is now the world's number one merchant for ballistic missiles, open for business with anyone, no matter how malign the buyer's intentions.
The United States has offered a roadmap for reciprocal steps that would enable North Korea to take a better course. We've had no serious response from Pyongyang.
Iraq continues to threaten its neighbors, the neighborhood, and its own people, and it continues to flaunt obligations that it undertook in 1991. And that can mean only one thing: It remains a dangerous regime, and it remains a regime determined to acquire these terrible weapons.
And Iran. Iran's direct support of regional and global terrorism and its aggressive efforts to acquire weapons of mass destruction belie any good intentions it displayed in the days after the world's worst terrorist attacks in history.
All of these nations have a choice to make -- to abandon the course they now pursue. Unfortunately, these terrible regimes have shown no inclination to do so. But the United States and the world have only one choice, and that is to act with determination and resolve.
As the President said, we must not and we will not wait on events while dangers gather, and we will use every tool at our disposal to meet this grave global threat. We will work to strengthen nonproliferation regimes and export controls. We will use our new and budding relationship with Russia to redouble our efforts to prevent the leakage of dangerous materials and technologies. And we will move ahead with a missile defense system that can do the job, unconstrained by the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. (Applause.)
This President is determined and committed to protecting America, our forces, our allies and our friends from terror that comes packaged atop a missile. And the United States is unequivocal in its resolve to do what we must to insure ourselves. As the President said, the price of indifference would be catastrophic.
But even as we address today's multiple challenges, even as we recognize that the war on terrorism is one that will have to be fought for a long time to come, we can look ahead to tremendous opportunities that are before us. We want to leave this world not just safer, but better. We are committed to a world of greater trade, of greater democracy and greater human rights for all the world's people wherever they live. September 11th makes this commitment more important, not less. Because, ladies and gentlemen, you know that America stands for something real. It stands for rights that are inalienable and truths that are self-evident. It stands for compassion and hope.
September 11th reintroduced America to a part of itself that some had forgotten or that some thought we no longer had. And we will carry this better part of ourselves out into the wider world.
We are a generous people. President Bush and the United States of America are committed to channeling our noble energies into an effort to encourage development and education and opportunity throughout the world, including the Muslim world. On every continent, in every land, this President, the education President at home, wants to press the goal of education for all abroad. Because there is one remarkable thing about education. It allows you to remake yourself into something new. It opens up to you the full range of possibilities of what you can be.
You know, I am, of course, a professor at Stanford University. And I can tell you that one of the most heartening things about being a professor in a great university is the students that you meet. You look out at your student body and you recognize that at this elite university, there may be one student who's a fourth generation Stanford legatee, but sitting right next to that student is a kid whose parents might be migrant farm workers, or a kid from rural America who is the first to go to school in his or her family. And you think, that's what this country is about, it's a belief that it really doesn't matter where you came from; it matters where you're going.
Terrorism, the kind of hatred and the kind of hopelessness that gets foisted on people around the world, cannot stand in a world in which people have that kind of hope. And that's why education in practical skills, rather than education in hatred is so important to peace and stability in the long run.
We are moving quickly, with places like Pakistan, to help them improve their educational systems. We have a teacher training initiative with Central America to improve the state of teaching in those countries. And we are putting millions of dollars into textbooks and into teacher training for new schools in Afghanistan where, for the first time in years, young girls will have that opportunity as well. (Applause.)
America is a remarkable country. One that finds its unity of purpose not in common blood but in common values. It is a country that rewards creativity and entrepreneurship and tries to bring opportunity through education for all. But in our hour of need, we found a country that has been renewed in those values and a country that looked to honor and family and to faith to get us through. There is a lot to do ahead of us. But renewed in who we are, renewed in our common purpose and our values, we will succeed. Thank you very much. (Applause.)
I'm told that I can take a couple questions from the members of the organization -- this is not a press conference.
Q You mentioned Russia briefly in your presentation. I had an opportunity to spend time in Russia, Moscow State University, and had an opportunity to meet with a lot of the Russian people. And I just wanted to find out the type of relationship that we have now with Russia following 9/11, how you see that going in the near future. And if you could also talk about Russia's actions in Chechnya? Do you think that needs to be reexamined in light of the attack on our -- in New York City? Because they perceive that as an attack on their own soil and they wanted to go out and root out terrorism in Chechnya.
DR. RICE: Thank you very much. Yes, of course.
First of all, all the way back at Ljubljana, which is when President Putin and President Bush met for the first time, President Bush said that he wanted to seek a new relationship with Russia that was more in line with the post Cold War era, and in line with a Russia that is in transition to better times for its people.
One reason that we were so concerned that the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and nuclear arms control not be somehow at the center of the relationship, that was at the center of the relationship with the Soviet Union. This is a different relationship with Russia. It is one that is evolving and I think evolving in very positive ways.
There could be nothing better than a Russia that is at peace with its neighbors, that is moving toward democratic development, that is developing markets that can take full advantage of an extremely creative population. We want to see those things happen and we have been aggressive in pressing our economic relations with Russia and with others to try to help Russia fulfill that tremendous potential.
We will have our differences. Russia is a big power, the United States is a big power, and it's not as if everything will be wiped away right immediately.
For instance, on Chechnya, we clearly have differences with the Russian government about Chechnya. We've said to them that we fully agree that the Chechen leadership should not involve itself with terrorist elements in that region, and there are terrorist elements in that region. But that not every Chechen is a terrorist and that the Chechens' legitimate aspirations for political solution should be pursued by the Russians. And we have been very actively pressing the Russian government to move on the political front with Chechnya.
But we have gotten very good cooperation from Russia in terms of support for the war on terrorism. They understand that this is a global campaign, and they've been extremely helpful. I think it can only help our relationship to show us that we have this common security problem and to continue to work.
Russia has a long way to go. We've been concerned about issues of press freedom in Russia. We've made that known to the government, and we'll continue to make that known. But on the whole, on the whole, the transition that is taking place in Russia and U.S.-Russian relations appear to be moving largely in the right direction.
Q -- I would just like to hear your prognosis of how we are going to get that trade promotion authority this session so that we can move forward, and your prospects for a free trade area of the Americas.
DR. RICE: Absolutely. Thank you very much for the question.
Let me say there may be no more important thing that we can do for countries that are struggling to find prosperity for their people than to open trade relations to them. The President said the other night -- and he's determined -- the House has acted, the Senate needs to act. We need trade promotion authority.
This is not just an economic issue, although it will be good for Americans and will bring jobs for Americans, and that cannot -- I can't say that strongly enough. The highest, best jobs come with opening trade. It is also a tool for democracy.
One of the first meetings that the President attended abroad was the Summit of the Americas, in which it was remarkable to hear every country there, many of them -- many of these leaders who had been either jailed or in the opposition, in the '80s when you had military governments in a lot of these places, say we have crushing problems in our countries. People like Lagos of Chile or Fox of Mexico saying we have crushing problems in our country. But the answer to that is more trade, more democracy and a good relationship with the United States.
We have to deliver on the promise of trade so that these countries can bring themselves and their people out of poverty. It is a better way to bring them out of poverty, frankly, than all the development assistance we could possibly give. We do development assistance. It's extremely important. Institution building is important. But trade is ultimately.
And so the ATPA, the Free Trade Agreement for the Americas, we're pressing very hard. I think the prospects are good on the international front. But the President needs that one tool of trade promotion authority in order to be taken seriously in these discussions.
Thank you very much. (Applause.)

George W. Bush,"February 28, 2002",Press Briefing by Ari Fleischer,"The James S. Brady Press Briefing Room
 1:06 P.M. EST
 MR. FLEISCHER: Good afternoon. The President, this morning, spoke with King Mohamed VI of Morocco. The two discussed a number of regional issues, including the Israeli-Palestinian situation and the U.N.-led effort to find a solution to the Western Sahara dispute. President Bush reiterated the high value that the United States places on its deep and friendly relationships with Morocco.
 After that, the President received his usual round of morning briefings, and then he convened a meeting of the Homeland Security Council. He's having his regular weekly lunch with the Vice President today. And then the President will depart from the White House to make a speech at the 2002 National Summit on Retirement Savings, where the President is going to discuss what in his opinion is a vital issue for all Americans as they get ready to retire or as they are retired, and that is affording them the best nest eggs, the biggest nest eggs possible so they can retire in happiness and comfort.
 The President will focus on the pension changes that were already enacted into law as a result of the Tax Act of 2001. He will talk about his plans for pension protections as a result of the collapse of Enron, as well as his belief that the best way to protect retirement savings for younger workers is to allow them voluntary options of personal retirement accounts.
 Following that, the President will meet back here at the White House with a bipartisan group of members of Congress to discuss issues involving steel. And a couple other announcements, and I'll be happy to take questions.
 The President will welcome Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean Claude Juncker for a working visit on March 6, next week. And the President and Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern will meet at the White House on March 13th. With that, I'm more than happy to take your questions.
 Q: Ari, can you explain the President's policy? Do we plan to send troops and money to every country that has -- says it has terrorists? What is this Yemen move, for one thing -- Georgia and so forth? And where is the money coming from? And does he feel that he has a mandate to go anywhere in the world -- the President?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Helen, in the wake of the attack on September 11th, one of the things I think you've seen around the world is how the world has stood in solidarity with the United States, and has faced now the fact that terrorism does represent a threat to people throughout the world, in various regions of the world, people from all types of governments, whether they are democracies or whether they are kingdoms, and different types of regions.
 And the President views it as a healthy and welcome sign of the multilateralism that is present in a way that people want to take this threat seriously and look to the United States for leadership, for strength and for help. And the President is pleased to help provide it.
 So the United States will work very productively and closely with the various nations throughout the world, as they turn internally to deal with their terrorism, with the problems they have in their borders.
 Specifically in Georgia, the United States will continue our helpful efforts to recognize and respect and strengthen the sovereignty of Georgia. The United States has previously provided helicopters to Georgia, as was previously announced.
 Q: That isn't a civil war there?
 MR. FLEISCHER: In Georgia? Georgia -- in the Pankisi Gorge, there are clear threats to the Georgian government. It's a rather lawless area that is a sovereign part of the Georgia Republic, and the Georgia government faces threats there. The United States will provide training and equipment to help Georgia deal with that.
 In Yemen --
 Q: Threats from terrorists?
 MR. FLEISCHER: There are threats there, as a result of terrorist activities and --
 Q: Well, is this an intervention into a civil war?
 MR. FLEISCHER: This is an attempt to help Georgia to train and equip the Georgians, as they deal with internal problems in an area of Georgia that is known for its terrorist influence.
 In Yemen, President Salih has responded very positively since September 11th especially, in helping to fight terrorism. That is a serious issue in Yemen. And the Vice President will be traveling to Yemen next month, as you know. And the United States wants to work closely with the Yemenese government. President Salih has shown real leadership on this measure.
 So the long answer to your question, Helen, is, yes, the United States will work directly and closely with nations around the world as they combat terrorism. Properly and proudly so.
 Q: Leader Daschle has had some -- are you done?
 Q: No, I want to follow up. There is a U.N. organization, and if there's truly a collective problem, why are we taking it on alone, and where do we get the money and the troops?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, in the case of Georgia, for example, this is a training exercise. It's equipment and training that's carried out by the United States military. And I don't think you're going to see members of Congress --
 Q: Like Vietnam, you mean, when we started in there?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, I'm aware that even in Afghanistan, Helen, there are some people who make that analogy to Vietnam, but not many. And the President doesn't agree with it, and I think most Americans don't either.
 Q: I just want to follow up, quickly. What are the criteria for intervention? You say that there's a threat to the Georgian government in the Pankisi Gorge. There's a threat to the Colombian government in parts of that country, to the Nigerian government in parts of that country, to the Thai government in parts of that country, to the Indonesian government in parts of that country. What's the criteria for this intervention?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Terry, it's been the longstanding policy of the United States government to work productively with other nations. And that involves military-to-military cooperation; it involves diplomatic cooperation; it involves a whole series of exercises that are collaborative and cooperational.
 The criteria in fighting the war on terrorism is going to be to continue to listen to the needs and the requests of nations throughout the world as they deal with these issues. Terrorism represents a serious threat not only to the sovereign nations of the world, but to the international community. And it's a healthy sign that since September 11th, nations have stepped up in their efforts to rout out the terrorists where they are. And the President welcomes that, is pleased with this sign of people looking to the United States to provide strength, help and leadership, and he intends to provide it.
 Q: Just to button it down, so if a government comes to the United States and says, this problem within our borders we can show you is connected to world terrorism in some sense, the United States is willing to get involved?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, the United States has been involved for years. It's not as if it's a new development. But what is helpful and productive is the number of nations who now take it even more seriously and want to do more because they recognize, in the wake of September 11th, just how far these extremists and terrorists are prepared to go.
 Q: There has been a lot of political fire today in the realm of foreign policy, and I would like to start by getting the President's reaction to Leader Daschle's uncomplimentary comments about the war effort, saying that the continued success of this effort is still somewhat in doubt. And he talked about if -- we've got to find bin Laden and other key leaders of al Qaeda; if we don't then we will have failed. And he said, ""But we're not safe until we have broken the back of al Qaeda and we haven't done that yet."" Can you respond, sir?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, I think the President would remind anybody who would be critical that this is about much more than any one person. This is about much more than Osama bin Laden. This is about an entire terrorist network. And the President has been very proud of the bipartisan cooperation that he's gotten from Capitol Hill on this. He'll continue to call for members of Congress to engage in that bipartisan spirit.
 Q: Do you think that the Leader stepped over the line here in his comments?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I won't make any characterization of it other than the President has said repeatedly this is about much more than any one man, Osama bin Laden. This is about the war on terrorism more broadly. That's where the President is focused. Individuals are free to focus on any one person if they think that's the best conduct of foreign policy. That's a different approach than the President has.
 Q: Is the continued success of this war in doubt, as the Leader suggests?
 MR. FLEISCHER: The President has no doubts. The President believes the United States has been and will continue to be successful, thanks in good part to the bipartisan support he's had from members of Congress.
 Q: Well, let me just follow up on a different point. Can you amplify in your comments today that you believe that President Clinton may have actually unleashed, through his summitry, the wave of violence at the end of 2000?
 MR. FLEISCHER: That's a mischaracterization of what I said. In fact, I don't even think I ever used the words ""President Clinton"" when I talked this morning. I never did. So that's --
 Q: But you meant to leave the impression that his summitry resulted in nothing, and may have stepped up the next round of violence, didn't you?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Actually, let me -- let's review this morning. I was asked a question that had said, ""It seems that the violence was quelled a lot when former President Clinton had both at the table"" -- meaning Arafat and Sharon -- ""had both parties at the table"" -- or Barak -- ""had both parties at the table. And now that Bush is leaving Arafat out"" -- was the question put to me -- ""hasn't that led to the violence?""
 I would simply cite the press for a response to that. And that amplifies on what I said. All you need to do is look back, as I indicated this morning, that the violence began in late 2000 and escalated through 2001. That's a fact. And all you need to do is take a look at the press at the time.
 For example, The Washington Post, on November 12th, reported, ""Since the violence erupted September 29th, 209 people have been killed."" You can keep going if you want. The Los Angeles Times on November 14th reported, ""Four Israelis were killed and eight wounded Monday."" The violence clearly began late last year. So what I wanted to do was set correct the premise of the question that was put to me, which implied that the violence began only when President Bush took office. What you really see happening here --
 Q: But you didn't use any of those press accounts in your comments earlier. I mean, you stand by the comment that, in fact, the Clinton administration tried to ""shoot the moon"" but ended up with nothing and more violence resulted. I mean, that's what you said.
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, obviously, the violence started on September 29th. And so what you can see here, clearly, as I've said, the violence began in late 2000, accelerated in 2001. Is that --
 Q: But the line, ""shoot the moon"" --
 MR. FLEISCHER: -- is that the problem that all Presidents have faced in the Middle East, over decades, which is something I've said repeatedly, not limited to any administration. But for decades, there's been a problem of violence in the Middle East. I corrected an impression that was left that there was no violence in the Middle East when the parties were at the table.
 Q: You think President Clinton overreached?
 MR. FLEISCHER: The question was, wasn't there no violence or little violence when the parties were at the table. That's an incorrect characterization and I corrected that this morning. The point --
 Q: What does it mean that the Clinton administration shot the moon and ended up with nothing?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, there's no question the violence really began on September 29th after the Camp David Accords broke down. That's an historical point. The President's approach is to learn the lessons of all previous Presidents, and that's something I think that all previous Presidents, including President Clinton, tried valiantly to achieve peace in the Middle East. No United States President is to blame for violence in the Middle East. The only people who are to blame are the terrorists who carry out the violence.
 President Bush is intent to learn the lessons of all previous Presidents and focus on what he thinks can be successful, which is an incremental approach based on the Mitchell Accords, and not an attempt to have an immediate comprehensive solution, because he thinks that will raise expectations too high and, therefore, meet with unmet expectations and, therefore, create more trouble.
 Q: So, in hindsight, it is the view of this administration that President Clinton made a mistake, a tactical error, in bringing the parties together for a summit at Camp David, absent 99 percent of a deal? That you raised expectations, and in your words, ""violence resulted"" when those expectations were not met? That it was a mistake to try to bring the parties together when they didn't really already have a deal?
 MR. FLEISCHER: The point I'm making, John, is that the President thinks it's important to learn lessons of all previous Presidents, who have worked very hard --
 Q: Well, what's the lesson of Camp David?
 MR. FLEISCHER: -- who have worked very hard to bring peace to the Middle East. And President Clinton did work very hard to bring peace to the Middle East. But President Bush's focus is to learn from all these lessons from previous administrations, and try to bring the parties together on something that the parties themselves can agree to. And that's why the Mitchell Accords are so helpful and important, because the Mitchell Accords begin with a process that focuses really on what the parties agree.
 Now, President Bush, when he was a candidate, said repeatedly throughout the campaign that it's important not to proceed beyond what the parties agree to.
 Q: Ari, so after the question this morning, when you made the statement, ""shoot for the moon and come up with nothing,"" the Clinton administration did perceive that as passing the buck. So you're saying that was a mischaracterization of a question that was asked this morning, saying that violence was quelled ""a bit"" in the Middle East, and now -- when both parties were brought together -- and now that Yasser Arafat is not brought to the table, there is fighting, it's escalated. That was the context of the question that I asked this morning.
 MR. FLEISCHER: Here's the question. The transcript reads, ""But, Ari, on the Middle East, it seems"" --
 Q: I asked the question. I know. I know.
 MR. FLEISCHER: Right. It says, ""Ari, it seems that the violence was quelled a lot when President Clinton had both at the table."" And then that --
 Q: But that doesn't mean it was ended. It was quelled a lot.
 MR. FLEISCHER: I understand. But then the implication was, shouldn't President Bush bring the parties to the table, because that seems to make the violence go away? And I was noting that despite best efforts, the violence began late in 2000, accelerated in 2001. There's no doubt about that. Everybody acknowledges that's what took place. What's important is what can be done now to achieve peace in the Middle East. And in that regard, the President is going to continue to focus on the Mitchell Accords. But there's no question that there are lessons to be learned from previous efforts to bring about peace in the Middle East, not only from President Clinton but from all Presidents.
 Q: Was one of the lessons to never receive the Palestinians?
 Q: So are you trying to -- in a way, it sounds like you're back-pedaling from that statement this morning, ""shooting for the moon and coming up with nothing"", because the Clinton administration is saying that that sounds like passing the buck.
 MR. FLEISCHER: No, there's no question that the President's focus is on making an agreement that the parties themselves can agree to, and not pushing beyond that.
 Q: Can I try one more? Can I try once more? The Clinton administration's approach rejects what you just said. Their approach was -- and they learned their own lessons; at least, they would say they learned their own lessons at Oslo and the follow-ups here at the White House -- that the incremental approach was not getting them anywhere. That they wanted to bring the parties to Camp David and shoot for the moon, to get the comprehensive agreement, because every time they got an incremental agreement, on the way to the next incremental agreement there was backsliding. You say the lesson of Camp David is that that's wrong?
 MR. FLEISCHER: The President has clearly said, and he said throughout the campaign, that the best way to achieve a comprehensive agreement is through the series that Senator Mitchell, a Democrat, has recommended, of interim steps that begin with security talks, that lead to political discussions about borders and boundaries, et cetera, finally getting to settlement issues. And that's how you build confidence to achieve a comprehensive solution.
 It is a different approach. But the point is that for decades American Presidents have wrestled with how to bring peace to the Middle East. President Clinton tried valiantly to do so. Nobody should be surprised if President Bush has a different approach. What is important to correct is an impression left by a question this morning that President Bush's different approach has been what led to more violence, because that's not an appropriate --
 Q: Can I just clarify a couple of things, going back just slightly? On Daschle, do you -- does the administration disagree with Daschle's assessment that the administration or the anti-terrorism campaign has not yet broken the back of the al Qaeda network?
 MR. FLEISCHER: You've heard the President repeatedly say himself that the al Qaeda network is far less capable of carrying out any of the operations they were previously capable of carrying out. That has been severely disrupted and severely hampered. It does not mean that the threat has gone away entirely, because there does remain a threat, as al Qaeda tries to reassemble in other nations. That's why the President is still so determined to pursue this war. He believes it's been successful and continues to be successful. It is not over yet.
 Q: Do you feel as though -- does this administration feel they have broken the back of the al Qaeda network?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I would characterize it exactly as I just did in the President's words. I don't use any other words than the President's.
 Q: One other thing. When we go to -- with the action in Georgia and Yemen and other countries, is there any concern in the administration about spreading itself too thin? While I understand the desire to respond to those countries who are trying to respond to the President's call to go after terrorism, there still is a question of not only what is the criteria for picking and choosing where you do go, but at what level is the administration concerned about spreading itself too thin, as well?
 MR. FLEISCHER: No. The President believes that when it comes to fighting the war against terrorism, and winning the war against terrorism, it requires the nation to be prepared to do whatever it takes. That's one of the reasons the President has made his budget request to the Congress for an increase in defense spending, and he hopes that the members of the Congress, Democrats and Republicans alike, will not under-fund defense, as some have indicated they might want to do. It is important in the President's opinion to do whatever it takes to win this war, because the threats to our country are of that nature.
 Q: I wanted to ask you again, getting back to what you said this morning -- one of your statements says, first of all, at least the impression we got, that the parties have been pushed beyond what they were ready to give. You also said, they should proceed at a pace that is doable and not raise the expectations too high. The impression we got was that you were criticizing the way that the Clinton administration handled the negotiations.
 MR. FLEISCHER: No, it was that question, just raised differently, that John King just asked. And what I said is, it should not surprise anybody that President Bush has a different approach for how to bring about peace in the Middle East. And it's patterned after a recommendation from the former Democrat Majority Leader George Mitchell, and that is the process I just outlined, which is an incremental way to build confidence to lead up to a comprehensive solution, as opposed to a one-shot deal to try to lead to a comprehensive solution.
 Q: Can I follow up?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Go ahead.
 Q: Please. You also mentioned this morning that the President was willing to look at requests from all nations, as far as how to fight terrorism.
 MR. FLEISCHER: Correct.
 Q: Well, in the case of Colombia, Colombia is getting aid already from the United States, but the aid is strictly limited by Congress for certain objectives only. And I understand Colombia has asked the U.S. government to see if they can use some of those funds to help fight the guerrillas, FARC, now that negotiations have broken down and there have been Colombian troops into the zone of dissension. And my question is -- I think the President answered he has to abide by the laws. My question is, is the President willing to try to convince Congress to allow some of those funds to be used the way the Colombian government wants to use it?
 MR. FLEISCHER: The President is aware that there are different members of Congress who have different ideas about the statute that is in place. The President will, of course, continue to, one, support the Pastrana government, and do so strongly; two, abide by the statute that is in place.
 The administration is prepared to listen to the ideas from members of Congress. But I remind you, this is also one of the reasons, because of the FARC and the threat that it poses to the people of Colombia and the government of Colombia, that the President's budget requests in 2003, $98 million of additional money to help train the Colombian military to defend critical infrastructure, with an additional focus on the oil pipelines in that country from the terrorist attacks that have taken place.
 So we are already engaged with Congress in an attempt to do more to help the Pastrana government. And you are correct, the United States has provided a very robust package of aid for Colombia. I think it was $1.3 billion of support for Colombia in their anti-narcotics efforts, as well as additional money through what's called the Andean Regional Initiative.
 Q: Ari, let me ask a specific question, and maybe get a specific answer instead of your general on the Middle East. What U.S. administrations were you referring to when you said they shot the moon and got nothing? Who were you referring to?
 MR. FLEISCHER: And we're back to John King's question, and I'd really rephrase it the same way I did when John asked it. The President's approach is going to be based on the Mitchell Accords, to have a more incremental approach.
 Q: My question was in the context of the Clinton administration, though. So you're saying the Clinton administration --
 Q: I'm asking you what administrations shot the moon and got nothing?
 MR. FLEISCHER: The President believes it's important to learn the lessons from all previous administrations in how to deal with the Middle East, and I'd leave it at that.
 Q: No, no, the question is --
 MR. FLEISCHER: I leave it at that.
 Q: The question is, what administration shot the moon and got nothing, and what administration pushed too far, pushed the parties farther than they want to go?
 MR. FLEISCHER: There's no question that the President's approach to how to bring about peace in the Middle East focuses on the approach recommended by Senator Mitchell, which creates a comprehensive settlement, which is what the previous administration sought to do. But over the Mitchell -- in accordance with the Mitchell recommendations, it seeks a comprehensive settlement at the end of a series of confidence-building measures, as opposed to any one summit.
 Q: Why won't you tell us who you're referring to when you say ""shot the moon and got nothing"", and ""pushed the parties further than they wanted to go""?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I think I phrased it exactly as I intend to.
 Q: Are you backing off on what you said?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Not at all.
 Wendell?
 Q: Ari, back on Daschle?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Wendell?
 Q: Two questions. Did we misunderstand, then, this morning when you said ""failure to reach that level"" -- the level of expectations -- did we misunderstand that the failure to reach that level was, in your opinion, one of the contributors to the violence?
 MR. FLEISCHER: The President believes that whatever solution can be arrived at has got to be set at such a level that the parties can agree to it. Failure to do that can lead to a situation where expectations are set too high. And if expectations are risen to a level where then people are disappointed, people can act on their disappointment.
 Q: I'm sorry, I have a second question.
 MR. FLEISCHER: Go ahead.
 Q: The other question is, the President, early on in this war on terrorism, used to confine his target, or define his target, as terrorists of ""a global reach."" Is it no longer the case that terrorist organizations need have a global reach for countries to petition the U.S. for aid and support, and be given that?
 MR. FLEISCHER: The President never limited the amount of assistance the United States would give to other nations who were dealing with terrorist threats to only those nations that deal with terrorist threats of a global reach. It's been a longstanding policy of the United States to help other nations in their wars on terrorism.
 And Georgia is a case in point. Prior to September 11th, the United States provided helicopters to Georgia. The issue of Georgian sovereignty is an important issue, and part of America's foreign policy. So it's not limited to just that group.
 Your question? Go right ahead.
 Q: Back on Senator Daschle. Between his comments and those of Senator Byrd, is this a sign to you that the Democrats are seeking to politicize this issue, and maybe put it on the table for midterm 2002?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, it's never easy to guess what the motives are of the loyal opposition on Capitol Hill. Obviously, people feel heartfelt about various issues. Obviously there's going to be politics involved. Some people may want to run for President one day. But the President is going to continue to always work productively and bipartisan with members of the Congress.
 Q: Bobby Byrd for President? (Laughter.)
 Q: Were you surprised, given that until now this had sort of been an off-limits issue -- did it surprise you that these comments came today?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, there's a bottom line, and the President always understands that members of Congress are going to speak out as freely as they should. But when it comes to the defense of the nation, the President surely hopes that nobody will vote to under-fund our nation's defense needs, because the needs are serious, there is a was underway.
 The President has made a serious proposal to the Congress. It's Congress' right and prerogative to ask tough questions about it. At the end of the day it will come to a vote, and the President hopes that the Congress will continue its bipartisan spirit and support the defense budget he sent up there.
 Q: Ari, just to go back one more time to this morning and the Mideast, just wondering, do you still stand by what you said this morning? Or, in retrospect, do you wish, perhaps, you had either qualified or tempered your --
 MR. FLEISCHER: No, of course, I stand by it. I think that it was important to address what the question suggested, which was that there the violence had been quelled a lot when the parties were at the table. That was a misrepresentation, and that's why I said this morning -- I said it again today and brought some newspaper articles to show it -- that the violence historically began in late 2000, accelerated into 2001. The premise of the question was, the violence had really subsided a lot, so long as the parties were at the table. That's an important impression to correct.
 Q: Well, you went further than that. You went beyond that and said --
 Q: -- Senator Daschle and Senator Byrd's comments were damaging to unity on the war?
 MR. FLEISCHER: No, I think members of Congress have every right to speak out as they see fit.
 Q: Ari, the President -- Wendell asked about the global reach, whether that was a continuing standard. When the President first launched -- he also said that the administration had to be careful to differentiate between real terrorists and people internally in a country, in a dispute that are exercising their own political voices. Now, what's unclear to us, and hopefully you can clarify it, is what the criteria is now. How is the administration being sure that a country calls up and says, these people, we think they're connected with al Qaeda, so can you come and help us? The case in Georgia is an example of that. What steps is the administration taking? What criteria is the administration proposing to make sure that the standards the President originally set are, in fact, met as these requests come in from other nations.
 MR. FLEISCHER: The standard, broadly, is the national interest. And let me walk through the specifics.
 Georgia: There is the Pankisi Gorge, which by all estimates is a lawless area. It's an area in which the borders are hard to seal and are unsealed, in which people freely go back and forth between Chechnya and Georgia into the Pankisi Gorge. And this was the case prior to September 11th, as I indicated. And that's why the United States provided, and you received notice, helicopters were sent to the Georgian Republic to assist them in their dealings, to maintain their sovereignty over an area that has been hard to control as a result of the terrorist infiltration and the problems in Georgia.
 In Colombia, the FARC is a listed terrorist organization. It traffics in narcotics, it attacks pipelines, it hijacks airplanes, it kidnaps presidential candidates and state senators. I think there's no question that the American people want to help the government of Colombia put an end to that type of violence.
 In Yemen: Yemen is a country that is an area that also is very hard to patrol and to control, in the northern reaches of Yemen. And the administration is very pleased that President Salih is helping the United States.
 I think what's interesting here is one of the accusations that was previously launched against the President is why won't he work cooperatively with other countries. Here what you have is these other countries coming to the United States and seeking our support and the President is pleased to provide it.
 Q: Are you asking -- is the administration asking those countries to bring evidence that these people are true terrorists in the form that the United States wants to commit itself to battle, versus political dissidents?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, in the three issues I cited, there's no question about that there are terrorist issues in those countries.
 Q: What does the White House, or what does the President think about this idea of sending out certificates to Social Security recipients to guarantee their -- pretend, at least, to guarantee their benefits in perpetuity?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Let me take a look at that, because I'm not aware of what the White House position is on that at this time.
 Q: -- comment back and forth on the Hill about this today.
 MR. FLEISCHER: Yes, I know, specifically on that topic. You'll hear a lot from the President any minute now on what the President's approach is, broadly, to retirement savings.
 Q: In the administration's view, how serious is the danger of coordinated efforts between foreign terrorist groups and domestic terrorist groups? And are you taking new steps to combat this danger?
 MR. FLEISCHER: When you talk about domestic terror, do you mean domestic to the United States?
 Q: Yes, white supremists, black militants, and so forth.
 MR. FLEISCHER: That's really something you would need to address more specifically to the FBI, which has a lot more experience directly in domestic terrorist groups. If you want to talk about any specific links, that's really the place for that.
 Q: You said that the release of the 7,000 documents from Energy is unrelated to the GAO suit against the Cheney task force.
 MR. FLEISCHER: Correct.
 Q: Are you saying that in all of that 7,500 pages, there's none of the material that others have been asking for from the Cheney task force?
 MR. FLEISCHER: No, what I indicated is the statute under which the court held that the Department of Energy needs to speed up their compliance with the FOIA request is a total separate statute and is unrelated to anything the GAO is seeking from the Energy Task Force. Without my having any knowledge of what specific papers the Department of Energy has, I can't -- that would be an impossible question for me to answer.
 Q: The court, by criticizing Energy for this glacial pace at which -- you don't think that strengthens in any way the GAO case for the information on contacts with industry that the GAO is trying to get from the --
 MR. FLEISCHER: Ann, both those matters are in court, so that's for courts to judge, not for me.
 Q: Would this, though, make the GAO suit moot? If there is substantial overlap between what the GAO is seeking through its suit of Vice President Office, and what NRDC is seeking through its FOIA request of Energy, and the NRDC request is complied with, would this make the GAO --
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, again, legally there is no connection between the two. But that's a question you'd have to put to GAO.
 Q: What's your take on that? Does it moot the GAO --
 MR. FLEISCHER: I'm not a lawyer. I think if you want to know if it's moot, that's something you should ask GAO. But the statute is wholly unrelated. All agencies of the government must always at all times comply with FOIA requests. As I indicated this morning, I don't think it comes as a surprise to anybody in Washington that people want their FOIA requests answered faster.
 In this case, the court held that the Department of Energy needed to speed up its compliance with the FOIA request. That's wholly unrelated to a legal case involving GAO seeking documents from the Cheney task force.
 Q: One more follow. Would the White House possibly argue that the GAO suit is now moot because the material is covered under this separate matter?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I have heard no such claim by the White House.
 Q: Is it not a setback to the White House that the very documents it's trying to protect in the Energy Task Force and the Vice President's Office could now be released en masse by the Energy Department per a judge's order?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, again, as I answered to Ann's question about the documents, themselves, without having knowledge of what documents specifically the Department of Energy required under its FOIA to give up, it's impossible to say what overlap, if any, there is with documents sought by GAO.
 Q: But it's represented that they are many of the same documents that are coming from the Energy Task Force --
 MR. FLEISCHER: And whose representations were those?
 Q: The judge's and the Energy Department, it's coming from Spencer Abraham, who is on the task force.
 MR. FLEISCHER: At the time the documents are released, you'll be able to evaluate that.
 Q: You just don't know?
 MR. FLEISCHER: That's what I answered -- is correct.
 Q: Ari, but in answering FOIA requests, agencies often redact a great deal of the material even that they release to the press. You will get a document that says, Department of Energy, with black lines through everything on the page of paper, thank you very much. Are there White House lawyers or Cheney task force lawyers reviewing what the Energy Department is about to release, and raising any objections, saying, we want this redacted on grounds of executive privilege, or on grounds of pending legal matter? Are the documents being -- is this an Energy Department decision alone, or are White House lawyers involved in the decision over how to handle the release of those documents?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I don't know if any White House lawyers are or are not involved. I know that the Department of Energy lawyers are taking a look at the judge's findings and they will comply with it, just as Energy indicated.
 Q: Ari, back on the Middle East. You said former President Clinton tried valiantly, but President Bush has a different approach in his dealing with the Mitchell Accords.
 MR. FLEISCHER: Correct.
 Q: Is that approach working, in the midst of all of this escalated violence?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, to reiterate, the situation in the Middle East has been very difficult for many a United States President. And President Bush is not the first to wrestle with this. The President is encouraged in the fact that this week the security talks have taken place. There had been a long period of time in which the security talks were not even taking place. That is the first step of the Mitchell Accords. There have been meetings between the Israelis and the Palestinians to discuss security arrangements in the Middle East.
 The President would like to see that accelerated so that the Mitchell Accord can be entered into in a more meaningful and longer-lasting way. The President will continue to press all the parties to comply with the Mitchell Accords, so it's a question of time.
 Q: And a follow-up to that: Is Yasser Arafat really not invited to the table as of yet?
 MR. FLEISCHER: As always, as I announced this morning, the visit by two leaders; if there's anything to announce, we'll announce it. There's nothing to announce on that topic.
 Q: Ari, both The Washington Post and Fox News reported this week that an Islamic school just outside Washington is using a textbook with the statement -- and this is a quote -- The day of judgment can't come until Jesus Christ returns to Earth, breaks the cross and converts everyone to Islam, and until Muslims start attacking Jews -- end of quote. How does this fit in with your claim that Islam is a religion of peace?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Lester, nothing that you will be able to cite as any individual case is going to change the President's view that Islam is a religion that represents peace.
 Q: Does this sound peaceful?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I think when you look broadly at any society, you're going to find individual statements, no matter where they are, that reasonable people disagree with, and disagree strongly.
 Q: The Raleigh News and Observer reports another notable speech in North Carolina where Tipper Gore called for what she termed ""ripping up of our Armed Forces' policy of don't ask don't tell,"" and ""we cannot rest until Congress adopts federal hate crime legislation that includes sexual orientation."" And my question, is the President giving any consideration to such a ripping up of the don't ask don't tell, or for hate crime legislation including all sexual orientations, like S&M and necrophilia and that sort of thing?
 MR. FLEISCHER: No, Lester, there's no change in the President's positions. Thank you.

George W. Bush,"May 07, 2002",Press Briefing by Ari Fleischer,"12:34 P.M. EDT
 MR. FLEISCHER: Good afternoon. Let me give you an update on the President's day, and a statement, and then I'll be happy to take your questions.
 The President began his day this morning with a phone call to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The phone call lasted approximately 15 minutes. The two Presidents noted the progress their negotiators are making on an agreement to reduce offensive nuclear weapons, and expressed hope that the agreement would be ready for their signature when the President travels to Moscow at the end of this month. The President told President Putin that he's looking forward to making the trip to Russia.
 The two Presidents also noted Georgia's progress in its fight against international terrorists residing in the Pankisi Gorge, near the Chechan border. And President Bush also urged that Russia pursue a political settlement to the Chechnya conflict. And finally, the two Presidents also discussed the dispute over poultry, and the President urged a prompt resolution of that matter.
 President Bush, also this morning, called Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. The two spoke for 10 minutes. President Bush expressed his desire for peace and for long-lasting results that will be meaningful in the region. And he emphasized the importance of improving the human conditions for the Palestinian people. He also told President Mubarak that he welcomed Egypt's leadership and helpful role in the region.
 Later this afternoon, the President will also call the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia to continue his discussions about ongoing peace efforts in the region.
 The President had, after his phone call to President Putin, his morning intelligence briefing, followed by his FBI briefing. The President participated in the event and gave a speech about the renaming of the Old Executive Building as the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. And early afternoon, the President will meet in the Oval Office with the Prime Minister of Nepal, where the President will reaffirm America's strong support for democracy in Nepal. They will talk about regional security issues, as well as economic and educational cooperation.
 And finally, this afternoon the President will meet with Prime Minister of Israel Ariel Sharon in the Oval Office, where they will discuss ongoing progress and process of bringing peace to the region.
 One announcement I want to give you -- or a statement, I'm sorry. The Permanent 5 members, or the Perm 5 members of the United Nations Security Council have agreed on a new system to implement economic sanctions on Iraq. This is a step forward. The Goods Review List promises to tighten controls over Iraq's illicit efforts to acquire material for its weapons of mass destruction programs, and allow for the freer flow of humanitarian goods to the Iraqi people. We expect the full Security Council to discuss, and then to vote in favor of this positive action this week.
 The Iraqi people will benefit from this new system. However, they will fail to realize the expected benefits if Saddam Hussein continues to manipulate the overall Oil for Food program. Saddam Hussein cut off oil exports for one month, exacerbating problems with funding in a vital humanitarian program for the Iraqi people. He undermines the program with illicit oil sales and schemes to force buyers to provide cash kickbacks.
 This program -- before it was referred to by the President as swiss cheese. The President thinks it is very effective now to have a tighter sanctions regime in place that prevents the Iraqi regime from getting access to material that can help it produce weapons or engage in war, while at the same time expressing America's longstanding humanitarian concern for the needs of the people of the region.
 And with that, I'm happy to take your questions.
 Q: Ari, last night, Prime Minister Sharon thanked the United States for what he said was its support in blocking the U.N. investigation into the crackdown in Jenin. Was that an accurate description of the U.S. role, and do you accept that thanks from Sharon?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Randy, I would want to look at a verbatim transcript of what the Prime Minister said before --
 Q: I have one. I can read from it if --
 MR. FLEISCHER: I'd be happy to hear it verbatim and look at in a full context. But what the President made clear was that the United States wanted to have transparency in Jenin, the United States wanted to get to the bottom of what took place. And the United States, we thought it was unfortunate that it was not able to proceed.
 Q: Can you say equivocally that you didn't give Sharon a bye on the U.N. inspection team in Jenin in exchange for his cooperation to end the siege of Ramallah?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I think that question was put directly to Dr. Rice and she said no.
 Q: Ari, is the President prepared to say specifically what he would like to see come out of this international peace conference? I know that's something they're going to talk about today, but a lot of the concerns have been raised by some of the Arab countries about why they don't want to sign on is that there's no goal at this point, other than to talk. Are we, before we make a real commitment to it, going to enunciate a series of goals that the administration wants to see accomplished?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, here's the path to peace that the President has outlined, and it has multiple parts to it. And it involves, first and foremost, the President's summitry, which you've seen in Crawford with the Crown Prince, you should see it today with Prime Minister Sharon's visit; the phone calls that the President is making, with a call he'll make this afternoon to the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia. That will be the 55th phone call the President has placed directly to an Arab head of state since he took office on January 20, 2001.
 He has had -- the meeting with King Abdullah of Jordan tomorrow will be the President's 13th summit in person with an Arab head of state. His meeting with Prime Minister Sharon today will be his fifth meeting with the Prime Minister. So the President, on a personal level, is working the phones and holding meetings.
 Secretary Powell has traveled to the region and is prepared to do so again when he thinks the time is right. And, as well, will be this meeting this summer -- much of the work, the principals and the players are all still being worked by the State Department in concert with many of our allies and friends.
 So it's part of a multiple stage of diplomacy. And the President believes it's far, far better for the parties to be talking than to be engaging in war. And that's part of what this meeting is focused on.
 Q: Is the President seeking to attach conditions, monitoring of the distribution of aid to the Palestinians from the United States, from the EU, from Arab countries, in order to cure the problem of corruption which you've spoken of here? Is the President seeking to put teeth in that criticism by attaching conditions to the distribution of aid to the Palestinians?
 MR. FLEISCHER: The President is very worried about corruption in the Palestinian Authority. He views this as an issue that the Palestinian Authority has got to confront and to take on, to make certain that the money that not only the United States provides, but that humanitarian concerns throughout the world, including the United Nations, provides to the Palestinian Authority indeed make it into the hands of the Palestinian people.
 At all times, United States programs are reviewed to make certain that they go into the hands of the people who are intended to receive them. And this is something the President discussed in Monterrey. And so this will be an ongoing item of concern that the President and the State Department will continue to monitor and make sure it's done right.
 Q: But in talking to somebody like President Mubarak -- you said he discussed improving conditions for the Palestinian people -- is the President also telling Arab leaders that, when you disburse money to the Palestinians, monitor it, we'd like to see precisely where it goes and be able to follow the money trail?
 MR. FLEISCHER: The core, Terry, of the President's message when he talks about Palestinian people and how to help on the humanitarian front with the Palestinian people focuses on a rebuilding of the Palestinian institutions. And the President wants to make sure -- and work with the Arab neighbors, as well as directly with the Palestinian Authority -- that as they rebuild and as they have financial help to rebuild, they rebuild with an eye toward transparency, democracy, fight against corruption. And it's an interesting way to measure the Palestinian Authority, because they have the ability here and today in the areas that they self-govern right now to demonstrate to the world their commitment to institutions that are dedicated to peace and stability based on the rule of law, not based on corruption.
 And so this is an ongoing part of the President's message to leaders in the Middle East about how to help the Palestinian people to help themselves, how to make certain that the Palestinian people have a Palestinian Authority that is worthy.
 Q: And the last question on this, is this a way to grow or to cultivate a new generation of Palestinian leaders, outside of the Arafat circle, that might be more acceptable to Israel's interlocutors --
 MR. FLEISCHER: Terry, it's just the right thing to do in the President's opinion. It's the right thing to do in order for the region to know that Israel and Palestine can live side by side in security and without risk of violence. And the best way to have neighbors live side by side is through countries that adhere to the rule of law, and not to the law of violence.
 Q: Is the President also monitoring the $10 million a day that we give to Israel, and all the arms and equipment, that they are really used in self-defense, after they actually have been used for aggression on the West Bank?
 MR. FLEISCHER: The President's position is abundantly clear on that. As you know, he said that Israel has the right to defend herself. Israel exercised that right --
 Q: Is an invasion of another country -- or another people, that is, entity, self-defense? And invasion.
 MR. FLEISCHER: Again, the President -- I refer you back to the President's speech of April 4th, in which he urged Israel to withdraw all its incursions.
 Q: Can you tell us, Ari, why the President favors an incremental approach to peace, as opposed to a comprehensive process as the last administration engaged in at Camp David?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, the President, as I indicated, is pursuing the path to peace along multiple lines. And the President is determined, no matter how difficult it is, to continue down that path to peace. And he has put this path in a way that it can reach out into many directions to see which one would be the most fruitful.
 There is no one magic approach to peace in the Middle East. If there was it would have been done and tried and successful a long time ago. The President does believe in learning his lessons from history and, therefore, he has established a multiple path to peace. And that involves, again, his personal efforts, and the meetings, the phone calls of Secretary Powell's, his travels to the region, importantly bringing in other nations, particularly Arab nations to help influence events in the Middle East, to help convince the Palestinian Authority about the proper route to go to secure peace.
 After all, there are nations, Arab nations in the Middle East that have entered into peace agreements with Israel; there are successful previous examples. And it's a multiple choice that the President is making to pursue the path to peace among all these avenues.
 Q: What lesson did he learn from history?
 MR. FLEISCHER: The President's point is that you have to move the process along in a matter that is consistent with the viewpoints of the participants in the process; that the United States can help be a partner for peace, but cannot force peace upon anybody. But we need to help all the parties -- the Israelis, the Palestinians, as well as the Arabs -- to reach an agreement that can be long-lasting.
 Q: Do you expect any new initiatives to come out of this meeting, specifically any kind of aid package for the Palestinians?
 MR. FLEISCHER: No, I think this meeting is going to be part of the ongoing consultation process. I do not expect any new initiatives to come out of this.
 Q: Ari, how does the President hope to convince Prime Minister Sharon that he has to deal with Yasser Arafat? What's his message going to be?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, the same way, Kelly, that the President has messages that he works very hard, and the State Department works very hard every day in convincing the Palestinian Authority and the Arab neighbors, as well -- through the long and patient art of diplomacy. I don't think anybody can look at one meeting as a magic moment. I think that people are going to want to look at the meeting today and the meeting he had with Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince, the meeting tomorrow with King Abdullah, phone calls he makes as all part of an ongoing, lengthy process which is starting to bear at least some fruit.
 Q: But when Mr. Sharon is expected to say that future negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians cannot include Yasser Arafat, how is the President going to --
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, let's see. Allow the meeting to take place. Let's see exactly what the Prime Minister says to the President. You'll have your opportunity to ask questions of the President after the meeting, and as well, we'll provide other information once the meeting is over.
 Q: Final follow-up. Unrelated follow-up.
 MR. FLEISCHER: Final follow-up, Kelly. Follow-up number seven.
 Q: Does the administration have any evidence that the Saudis have been giving money to Hamas or to the families of Palestinian suicide bombers? Does the U.S. have any evidence of that?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Secretary Powell said Sunday when he was asked the exact same question, and nothing has chanced since then, we have raised that matter with the Saudis; the Saudis have given us assurances that they are not doing that. And the United States accepts those assurances.
 Q: Ari, the last time that the Nepali Prime Minister visited the White House was during President Kennedy's term, 40 years ago. This is the first time in 40 years that this leader is coming to the White House to meet with President Bush, this afternoon. What I'm asking you, you think his visit has not been overshadowed by more famous leaders today meeting with President Bush than this very tiny Hindu state in the world? And is President Bush really very well briefed on the problems in Nepal from Maoist terrorism, and also the economic, the economy and all that?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, first of all, I think any time a visiting head of state has an opportunity to meet with the President of the United States in the Oval Office, they will be the first to tell you how welcome they feel, and what a nice reflection it is of the United States that no matter what is going on in the world, the United States treats visiting heads of state with dignity and grace, and welcomes them into the Oval Office. And that is exactly what the President will do with the Prime Minister.
 Nepal is fighting a Maoist rebellion, and Nepal is an example, again, of a democracy. And the United States is committed to helping Nepal. There's a request by the administration for $20 million in the supplemental appropriations bill to help Nepal. The United States currently provides a couple million dollars of assistance toward Nepal. And so -- it's up to the press to determine what meetings are the most newsworthy, but the President welcomes all into the Oval Office.
 MR. FLEISCHER: Jacobo? We're going to move it around.
 Q: Ari, first question, following up on Kelly's question -- Prime Minister Sharon has practically accused Saudi Arabia of financing terrorism. The United States claims that Saudi Arabia is helping the peace process, especially after the meeting with Prince Abdallah. How is the President going to convince Ariel Sharon that Saudi Arabia can play a major role in the peace process if that's what the Prime Minister believes?
 MR. FLEISCHER: You know, in the Middle East there is nothing new about one nation having a statement about another nation that people differ about. That's been the history of the region for forever. The United States' special role, though, is to play the part of bringing the parties together. And that's why the President is welcoming Ariel Sharon to the Oval Office today, and that's why he'll welcome King Abdullah here tomorrow, that's why he called President Mubarak of Egypt, et cetera. And that will be the role of the United States, to constantly engage in the diplomacy required to take nations that begin, at least, with a publicly stated strong stance, and try to move them together.
 Q: Can I follow up on a different subject, Ari? It has to do with the very strong accusation that the U.S. government made yesterday against Cuba. Under Secretary of State John Bolton basically said that the USA believes Cuba is developing biological weapons and transferring expertise to rogue nations. Is there any proof of this, or this an assumption of the United States?
 MR. FLEISCHER: No, it's not an assumption. I assure you that Secretary Bolton would not have said it if he did not have good cause, reason and fact to say it. That was based on sound analysis, and on information that is studied and available to the United States government.
 Q: But Cuba's been working with biomedical things for four decades. Is this something that has occurred lately, or does the U.S. believe this has been going on for years?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, as you know -- you've covered this region for a long time -- analysts and even Cuban defectors have long cast suspicion on the activities conducted in Cuban facilities and their biomedical research. And so I assure you, it would not have been said if it was not said for good basis.
 Q: Ari, two unrelated questions. First, there were these reports this morning that former President Clinton may get appointed to a group that's going out to East Timor. Can you tell you tell us about this? And is he under consideration, and why this --
 MR. FLEISCHER: There will be an event in East Timor that the United States will be sending a bipartisan delegation to attend. And it is not at the point yet where I can say something formal. Once it is a formal statement, I will be happy to issue it.
 Q: And you would expect that to be when?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Sometime soon. I'll just leave it at that.
 Q: So the answer is yes. (Laughter.)
 MR. FLEISCHER: Helen, you must be new in town.
 Q: You've learned. (Laughter.)
 Q: Back on the meeting with Prime Minister Sharon today. The Prime Minister, in his visits around town, has been talking about two different elements of his plan. One is working out physical partitions that would protect Israeli towns from suicide bombers. And the second, of course, is moving in much slower steps than you or Secretary Powell seem to have described before on the political track. Can you tell us what the President's position will be on each of those issues?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, two points. One, allow the meeting to take place and we'll see precisely what the Prime Minister says. But two, the President is going to adopt an approach to bringing peace to the Middle East by continuing these conversations directly with the principals and with the parties. And I do not expect that you will hear or see the President tick-tock each and every development, or try to negotiate events through the press.
 The President wants to continue to be a good ear to all the parties, so they know they can be welcome in the United States, and the United States will listen to what they have to say, and the United States will work its influence with all three parties to try to bridge gaps and bring people together. Sometimes the best way to bridge those gaps is to do so quietly and diplomatically, to listen, not prejudge. And that's what the President will do, that's his approach.
 And you know, again, there are going to be times, I think, where you will see, and you will know it, good success as a result of the President's quiet efforts. They're going to -- that was the case, of course, in the resolution of the situation in Ramallah. There are going to be other times where there are going to be setbacks, where it's going to be hard to bring the parties together. And that's, again, why the President knows that this process will be lengthy, but he will be dogged in trying to bring about successful results.
 Q: Ari, as the President tries to bring these sides together, though, he seems to have settled on a few things -- that there's a role for Arafat, there's a role for the Saudis, we need to keep the goal of a Palestinian state in mind and get there -- all of which Sharon doesn't seem to buy into. How does he -- what kind of leverage does he have to try to bring the Prime Minister to his point of view? And will that be one of the purposes of today's meeting?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, again, that is the essence of diplomacy. But I think if you had said, as some did shortly after the President's speech in the Rose Garden April 4th, that the Israelis say they won't withdraw -- and, of course, after time, after the diligence and the pursuit by the President, a satisfactory result was concluded to Israel's operation in the withdrawal. From the President's point of view, they did listen.
 So not everything in the Middle East moves at the speed of press deadlines. But it will continue to move at the speed of the partners for peace that the President is seeking to assemble as he tries to bring the parties together.
 Q: Following on that, the President is totally satisfied that Sharon met his request for -- I forget the exact words, as soon as possible?
 MR. FLEISCHER: What I was referring to is that -- if you recall, right after the President's speech on April 4th, we were in Crawford, and I said what's going to happen next is the parties are going to take time, the nations are going to take time to digest what the President said in his remarks. And that is the nature of the Middle East. There are going to be a series of events that take place that each nation and the various parties are going to weigh carefully, listen to. I suspect you'll hear some things in public that the nations may not say in private. And that is all part of the process of trying to quietly bring people together in the Middle East. And that's going to be the ongoing efforts by the President.
 So the President's message to Israel has been and will continue to be that Israel needs to focus on a broader vision of how to create an environment for an Israel and a Palestine to live side by side. The President believes it is entirely in the interest of the Israeli people to create that environment so the Palestinian people can have a state that is free from corruption, that's based on the rule of law, that develops where Israel does not have to only worry about security, but Israel, like Israel has done with Egypt and with Jordan, can develop into a peaceful relationship with neighbors, where there used to be hostility.
 Q: Ari, does this action that you announced today about Iraq address in any way the reported use of stealth, under the table surcharges that Iraq's been putting on its oil exports to get around the earlier sanctions and the earlier restrictions on where any oil profits could go?
 MR. FLEISCHER: You may want to take a look at the exact text of what is being passed out at the United Nations. And the purpose of this -- and there's a whole list of goods that will be permissible -- and the whole purpose of this is to address what's been one of the greatest weaknesses in the sanctions policy, which is it was not being followed.
 The President believes it is far, far better for the world to know that there are certain products that absolutely will not be allowed to go into Iraq because they can be used for military purposes or for the purposes of developing weapons of mass destruction; while there will be other goods that can and should go into Iraq to help the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people.
 The previous sanction policy was not effective because it was so riddled with loopholes. And as a practical matter, that, as the President said repeatedly, was really a sanctions policy that resembled Swiss cheese. And this is a successful result of the United States' efforts that have been long going at the United Nations. If you recall, some six months ago, we were very close to getting this done. Now we've worked very closely with the Perm 5, and Russia, again, has played a very constructive role in helping to reach an agreement at the United Nations.
 Q: To what extent is this sort of a run-up to tightening diplomatic and military sanctions, if you will --
 MR. FLEISCHER: I think you have to look at this as an event in and of itself. This is something that gets reauthorized every six months by the United States. The reason the U.N. set this as a six-month renewal is so they could always come back and look at this in and of itself, to make sure that it was working, and if not, to make adjustments. They are now making these adjustments.
 Q: Before we get back to the Middle East, I want to ask you a quick question about the supplemental, if I may. Already the House, with the leadership of Chairman Young, is talking about $3 billion more than the President was talking about. It hasn't even gotten to the Senate side yet, where it's sure to have many more billions added to it. What is the administration's current thinking about how large a supplemental it can accept?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, the House Appropriations Committee has not yet marked it up. The administration is reviewing it carefully. And we'll be taking a look at obviously the line items within the supplemental appropriation bill, as well as the aggregate spending figure. The President's message to the Congress is to hold the line on spending. We are a nation that has a deficit. And it's important for Congress not to add excessive spending to make the deficit worse. There are legitimate defense needs that have to be addressed that the President proposed funding for; homeland security needs, as well. And so we will be taking a very careful look. And stay in touch, is what I can tell you for now.
 Q: I wanted to shift to the Middle East. I'm not quite clear how the administration envisions this process --
 MR. FLEISCHER: Is this a follow-up to your previous question?
 Q: Correct. I indicated at the outset that I wanted to insert that before we got to the Middle East.
 MR. FLEISCHER: Is this a related follow-up, or an unrelated follow-up? (Laughter.)
 Q: It's an unrelated follow-up.
 Q: The best kind. (Laughter.)
 Q: The administration -- it's not quite clear to me what the administration -- how it envisions the process going forward. There's a lot of discussion about whether or not the idea of a complete peace agreement should be on the table as an incentive for Palestinians to look forward to something other than a constant battle with the Israelis. How does the administration view the process from here on out? Do we need a new peace agreement on the table quickly in order to create an incentive for the Palestinians?
 MR. FLEISCHER: All of this is going to be discussed in a series of meetings and phone calls that the President is having. There are a variety of different approaches, and the President wants to listen carefully to various people's ideas about how to move forward. And as he moves forward on what I describe as his path to peace that has multiple avenues to it, the President will continue to listen carefully to people's ideas.
 And one area, again, that I strongly urge you to keep your focus on is, in addition to what has traditionally been done involving the direct talks with the parties, one interesting development that has been present since January 20, 2001 is the constant work that the President has done and his diplomats have done with other nations in the region, as well as Europe and others. There is a view that to create the environment for peace in the Middle East, there is a role that others can play to help the parties to enter into political talks and political dialogue.
 Make no mistake, the President believes that to bring peace to the region, there has to be a focus on the political process, so that we can go beyond security, while making sure that Israel has its security needs addressed, because it would be much harder to do without security needs being addressed, but a real return to a focus on political events, political settlements -- the speed of which will be determined in good part by the willingness of the participants to move with the President.
 Q: One of the things, though, that's not quite clear is you're talking about democracy, anti-corruption, that sort of thing among a new Palestinian Authority. How does the administration envision that happening? Are you -- do you see new elections among the Palestinians? Are you going to --
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, first and foremost, it will come from the Palestinian people. I think there's no question that prior to the recent surge in the violence, Yasser Arafat was under a lot of pressure from Palestinian people to end the corruption. There was a tremendous amount of dissatisfaction by the Palestinian people, with corruption within the Palestinian Authority, with money that should have been given to the Palestinian people that ended up abroad. As a result of the violence, that focus of the Palestinian people shifted onto matters of security, and therefore that issue has subsided.
 What the President is focused on now is reconstruction, a way to help the Palestinian institutions be recreated so that people again focus on what is natural in life. And what is natural in life is economic opportunity, is education for children. It is not violence. And as the violence fades, there will be a gradual shift back to the Palestinian people asking what type of government will represent us as we try to educate our children, as we try to have jobs and economic opportunity?
 Israel plays a role in that, as the President has talked about, at the checkpoints, making sure that the Palestinian people have opportunities for economic advancement. That, too, will be made easier when violence subsists, because, therefore, Israel will be more willing to allow people to come through the checkpoints.
 So the President's focus is on the rebuilding of the Palestinian infrastructure in a way that the Palestinian people can have a Palestinian
 Authority that is worthy of their goals. And those goals will be easier achieved if the Palestinian Authority focuses on rule of law and a fight against corruption.
 Q: I have a question on Kyoto and then a follow-up on something you just said. Now that the administration has renounced this International Criminal Court, there are reports that the U.S. might de-sign or actually pull out of Kyoto, which it hasn't done formally yet. Any comments on Kyoto?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, first of all, just on the language, to be specific, on the International Criminal Court, it is not a de-signing. That's a legal matter. It has the effect of withdrawing the United States from any participation. And on that point, too, I just want to bring to your attention a document that was submitted with the signature of President Clinton on December 31, 2000, in which President Clinton himself, on the ICC, referred to it as a treaty with significant flaws. And he went on to state, ""The United States should have the chance to observe and assess the function of the court over time, before choosing to become subject to its jurisdiction. Given these concerns, I will not and do not recommend that my successor submit the treaty to the Senate for advice and consent until our fundamental concerns are satisfied.""
 So that treaty had been signed by President Clinton, as he called it, with significant flaws. And he urged his successor not to submit it. And I have heard nothing new on Kyoto. I think that matter has been dealt with. The President has already announced what he views as an alternative to Kyoto that will help reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
 Q: On another matter, FERC released some documents yesterday suggesting that Enron manipulated electricity prices during California's energy crisis last year. Has the administration rethought its attitude toward deregulation in light of these revelations?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, I'm glad you asked that, because it does cast a light on something very interesting and very important in terms of the administration's ongoing commitment to take action if there is any wrongdoing in market manipulation. And last May, the President called on FERC to be vigilant in protecting consumers. And we've always said that if anybody is illegally manipulating markets, they need to be held accountable.
 And these documents, which as you accurately point out, were released by FERC, an independent agency of this government, were released as part of an ongoing investigation launched by this administration through FERC, which has been something that the President has noted and he expects the investigation will be vigorously pursued, wherever it may go.
 As a general matter, the administration supports very tough enforcement of the laws that protect consumers, and that applies to the energy markets, as well. If you take a look at the legislation that is pending on the Hill in the energy bill and what we submitted to the Congress, the legislation the President proposed asked Congress to enact tougher penalties to prevent market manipulation. And many of these provisions, I'm pleased to note, are in the Senate bill.
 Let me give you some specificity to that. We have proposed to the Congress that they increase criminal penalties for violating -- if anybody's found to have violated the Federal Power Act, that the penalties be increased from $5,000 to $1 million; and in some cases, from $500 per day to $25,000; and that prison terms be increased from two years to five years. Those are all items that we had proposed that we will fight for in the conference that is now pending up on the Hill. We have asked to make sure that FERC has the authority it needs to go after -- to do its job. It's also important to prevent the opportunity for market manipulation by modernizing and expanding the electricity grid, and encouraging investment in new, clean generation. These issues are pending before the Congress now, and the administration will continue to work that issue. It raises important issues.
 Q: Do you support Senator Feinstein's call for a criminal investigation of Enron?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Anytime any individual asks the White House to make a comment about taking a stand on a specific criminal matter, the White House is not the proper agency to make determinations about who should and who should not be criminally prosecuted. Those issues, I think the American people recognize, belong in the hands of the professional prosecutors. It is their judgment to make that. I note to your attention that FERC is investigating.
 I'm going to keep moving around. People haven't had it yet. You've had one before?
 Q: David asked it.
 MR. FLEISCHER: Okay. Mark?
 Q: Thank you, Ari. King Abdullah's role. It seemed that when President Clinton found the Mideast peace negotiations at an emotional and difficult spot, he'd tend to bring in King Hussein. Do you see Abdullah playing a similar sort of go-to role in this process?
 MR. FLEISCHER: This is why I drew your attention to the fact that the President has called 55 Arab heads of state since he became President -- 54; it will be 55 this afternoon. This has been an ongoing part of the President's diplomacy. The President recognized from the very beginning that there is a role to play for the other nations in the region. Clearly, that includes Jordan.
 Jordan has a peace treaty with Israel. Jordan has been a very helpful influence in the region. There is a role for Jordan to play. And there's also a role for Egypt to play. They have played a leadership role. Saudi Arabia, interestingly now, with the role that they played just a few weeks ago and continue to play; Morocco. There are a number of nations that have been helpful and productive. And the President remains and will remain in close touch with them, as well as Secretary Powell doing his hard work, too.
 Q: Ari, you said before that we had raised with the Saudis questions about this support for suicide bombers, they'd given assurances and we had accepted those assurances. Does that mean that you do not believe the material the Israelis presented proves anything, or could that change our belief in the Saudi assurances?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Again, I just refer you to what the Secretary said. And we have received those assurances directly from Saudi leaders at the highest levels.
 Q: Can I just follow on that?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Campbell, we have an order. You were called on earlier.
 Q: Another question related to the Saudis. You've been stressing today the need for the Palestinian Authority to have a democratic, open rule, respect of human rights. Saudi Arabia is not a democracy, does not have human rights, doesn't even let women drive. Do the same standards that apply to the Palestinian Authority now also apply to Saudi Arabia?
 MR. FLEISCHER: The President made clear in his State of the Union address the important need around the world, no matter where in the world, for values that represent the best path to peace, as well as for fundamental fulfillment of individual rights that are eternal human values to be implemented throughout the world, and that includes Saudi Arabia.
 Q: In all of the hours that General Zinni and Secretary Powell have spent talking with Yasser Arafat, they surely must have mentioned Osama bin Laden and our deep concern about him. And if Arafat ever, in any way admitted that bin Laden is a terrorist, that would have been very good news that you would surely have told us about, Ari. And my question is, but the fact is that Arafat has never admitted that bin Laden is a terrorist. Isn't that true, Ari? Or can you, from your remarkable memory, cite any time where he has admitted that Osama bin Laden is a terrorist?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Lester, I do not chronicle every statement made by Yasser Arafat to tell you whether he did or didn't. But the point is, the President has said Yasser Arafat has not earned his trust, that Yasser Arafat has not done enough to fight terrorism and to crack down on corruption. And that's the more important question for President Bush.
 Q: Wait a minute, I had my follow-up. Does the President believe that our airline pilots should not be allowed to carry any sidearms?
 MR. FLEISCHER: No change in the President's position.
 Q: What is the President's position? He believes --
 MR. FLEISCHER: The President has listened to his security experts and aviation experts who have come to the conclusion that they should not.
 Q: I just wanted to clarify what you said earlier to Deb's question. On the Saudi question, you keep referring us back to the Secretary's comments. But this morning he said that the President hadn't yet seen the documents, that he was going to look them over.
 MR. FLEISCHER: That's true, as well.
 Q: So he still hasn't seen the documents?
 MR. FLEISCHER: No, I presume that they will be brought with the Israeli delegation. The President himself has not seen them.
 Q: This morning you said that you would looked them over, and then at that point make a decision as to whether you needed to raise any additional concerns with the Saudis. Does that still hold?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Yes, it does.
 Q: Because what Powell was saying was, everything is fine, we take them at their word.
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, we can take a look at the documents and see, as I indicated this morning, if there is anything that we need to raise with Saudi officials.
 Q: A quick follow-up on the Middle East issue. On April 4th in his Rose Garden statement, the President called on Prime Minister Sharon to cease the construction of settlements. How important is that issue in the near-term to the President's search for peace? And what does he expect of Ariel Sharon, who said he doesn't intend to do that?
 MR. FLEISCHER: That's one of many important issues. And it's something that both Secretary Powell and Dr. Rice addressed when they said that this is something that we will be talking to the Israeli government about. We already have had conversations under the Mitchell plan, as you know, that did call for an end to settlement policy. It is one of the issues that has to be addressed as part of what I referred to earlier, as the political dialogue -- the discussion and a resolution of border issues, a discussion and resolution of checkpoint issues, a discussion and resolution of settlement issues. All of those are part and parcel of the political talks that are going to be the key to getting real, lasting progress done.
 Q: How does the President intend to develop a reconstruction program for the Palestinians? And secondly, with all the listening and talking, the initiatives that are going on for peace in the region, is Mitchell and Tenet and all that off the table now, or are they still part of the process?
 MR. FLEISCHER: No, they're still part of the process. And again, take the words of Tenet and Mitchell out of it. Tenet equals security, Mitchell equals political process, political talks. Those are two fundamental pillars to achieving peace in the Middle East. You have to have both. And so they both apply, just as much as before.
 Q: Okay, then the Palestinian aid, is there a plan yet in mind for developing a program?
 MR. FLEISCHER: The United States provides, with the recent $30 million increase in aid for the Palestinian people, the United States now provides $110 million annually for the Palestinian people, as well as the support the United States gave to the Oslo Conference some three weeks ago, which also has provided a humanitarian effort worldwide to bring aid to the Palestinian people.
 Q: No new conference or --
 MR. FLEISCHER: I think these are all parts of the ongoing discussions. The President talked to President Mubarak about it today, for example. And I assure you that the levels -- appropriate levels at the State Department and other agencies of the government, that's where it's being worked out.
 Q: Ari, as part of the interim steps that Israel would like to propose to the White House, one of them is to grant Palestinians a state over areas that they already control, pushing down the road the thornier issue about where do you draw the final status border. In the President's vision of what a Palestinian state looks like, does he believe it could start small and expand?
 MR. FLEISCHER: John, this is where I indicated earlier, I'm just not going to tick-tock or give the play-by-play on everybody's initiative and every specific level of how to bring peace to the region. What the President wants to do is create an environment where different people can bring their ideas forward, and then quietly bring people together around the ideas that lead to peace. And, unfortunately, when it comes to diplomacy, one of the best ways to do that sometimes is quietly. That's the best way to be effective. So you're not going to hear the President give a thumbs-up/thumbs-down to each and every specific proposal that anybody makes. He's going to continue to play America's unique role, which is to bring people together around the principles that the President has outlined.
 Q: When he talks about a Palestinian state, what's he talking about?
 MR. FLEISCHER: He's talking about a Palestinian state whose precise borders and the timing of which it would be created would be determined in negotiation with the principals in the area.
 Q: Ari, does the President still have confidence in Army Secretary White? At issue is whether the Army engaged in misconduct, lobbying Congress to maintain funding for this weapons program --
 MR. FLEISCHER: The President -- yes, the President has confidence in Army Secretary White. He thinks he's doing a good job at his post.
 Q: So he's ruled that the Army Secretary did not engage in any misconduct when it comes to lobbying for this weapons program?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, the President makes no such rulings. But that's something that the Inspector General of the Department of Defense is taking a look at. But that's the answer to your question.
 Q: You were really telling us today that a nuclear treaty, nuclear reduction treaty is going to be signed in Moscow, weren't you, really? Has it a new momentum that suddenly it's --
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, as you remember when Foreign Minister Ivanov was here and the President and the Foreign Minister discussed the prospects, how the President said at that time he was hopeful we could get an agreement. There's been ongoing continued diplomacy.
 This is another area where the President really worked very hard and quietly with President Putin directly -- with President Putin directly to achieve a reduction in our offensive weapons to between 1,700 and 2,200 weapons, and then to codify the agreement. And the President always hoped he'd be able to codify it during his visit to Russia. That's something the President has said. And he, as well as the experts in the State Department, have worked very diligently behind the scenes to make that a reality. But the President still is hopeful it will happen. But as he discussed with President Putin this morning, good progress continues. And that's an encouraging sign. That will be a significant development.
 Thank you.

George W. Bush,"May 24, 2002",Remarks to Community and Religious Leaders in Moscow,"Thank you all very much. Mr. Ambassador, thank you and Lisa for opening up your modest home. [Laughter] I bet every Ambassador that represents the United States wishes they lived this way. But we appreciate your taking on this very important assignment, and that is to represent our country here in Russia.
I'm honored that Laura was traveling with me today. Trips always seem to go so much better when she is by my side, so I'm really glad you got to meet Laura. I like to tell the story in America that when I married her, she was a public school librarian who didn't like politics and didn't particularly care for politicians. [Laughter] And then she got stuck marrying one. [Laughter] But she's doing a great job for our country, and I'm real proud of her.
And I'm proud of the team I put together as well. I've got a great national security team, headed by Colin Powell and by Condi Rice and Andy Card. And I'm honored they're traveling with me, and I'm honored you have a chance to meet them as well.
And thank you all for coming. For those of us, the Spaso House—at least those of us who've paid attention to international politics—the Spaso House was always viewed as a refuge for freedom. And I'm so privileged to give you a few comments here in this historic setting, where so much history was written.
You know, I'm aware that during World War II, Russian, American diplomats and soldiers met here as allies. It's kind of an interesting part of the history of this house. And during the cold war, this is where many of you came, refuseniks and human rights activists. You're always welcome here, and we're glad you're here.
Our Nation stands for freedom. That's what we're fighting off the terrorists about. We believe so strongly in freedom, we're willing to defend it at all costs. The Soviet era is gone. The cold war, I hope, is past us. And today President Putin and I signed an historic document. It was more than just a document that reduces nuclear weaponry, although that in itself is good. It's a document that says there's a new era ahead of us, that instead of being stuck in the past, these two leaders are willing to take two great countries forward in a new relationship built on common interests and cooperation, and cooperation on all fronts—the idea of working together to make the Russian economy strong and vibrant so people can make a living, so people have hope about putting bread on the table for their families; the cooperation of fighting terror; the cooperation of promoting peace. But the best cooperation also must be based on common values, as well as common interests.
And I want you to know that we hold the values in America dear, and you know that. We hold dear what our Declaration of Independence says, that all have got uninalienable rights, endowed by a Creator—not endowed by the ones who wrote the Declaration of Independence but by a Creator, a universal Creator. I want you to know that I believe all governments have a duty and responsibility to protect those rights, those unalienable rights.
In Soviet times, people heroically defended those rights with incredible courage, and you earned the respect of a lot of people—a lot of people—by doing so. Many of you now are active in a modern Russia, and I want to thank you for staying active and involved in this important society, starting with making sure that freedom is protected by rule of law. And we agree completely, and we hope we can help, because rule of law is essential for a modern society to thrive and to succeed.
I applaud your commitment and your patriotism. I love the fact that you love your country. I love mine, and you love yours, and that's incredibly healthy and important. You understand that free nations and a free Russia require strong civic and religious institutions, committed to democratic values.
Russia's on the road to democracy, but it's important, as she does so, that she embrace the values inherent in democracy. In the past, I know you know that we have been committed to helping institutions which promote those values through direct Government assistance, and we will continue to do so. We believe it's for the good of Russia. We believe it will help Russia develop in a way that will be—enable Russia to become a lasting friend. And that's what I'm interested in. I'm interested in friendship and peace and mutual development.
Most Russians want and expect what most Americans want and expect, and that's important for the Russian people and the American people to understand, a Government—starting with a Government that works for citizens, that represents everyday citizens, not a corrupt elite. And that's important.
People want a society ruled by law, not by special privilege, special circumstance; a law where people are treated equally, regardless of their religion, ethnicity, income level. In a multiethnic society, people must work toward tolerance and reject extremism. It's important in America, just like it's important here in Russia. And this is a multiethnic society, to the credit of Russia, just like America is a multiethnic society, which makes our country strong. We're bound together by common values. And so can Russia be bound by the same values.
To reach these goals, societies need fair laws and, as importantly, fair enforcement of law. They need independent media that is respected by the Government. I remind those who sometimes get frustrated with the media that even in America, elected officials sometimes don't agree what's written about them—maybe especially America, for all I know. [Laughter] But it's important for those of us who value democracy to promote an independent media.
Opposition parties must be free to associate and must be free to speak their minds. In order for a democracy to be strong, there has to be competition of ideas, a free discussion of ideas, and an airing of philosophy in an open way. Freedom of religion and separation of church and state are so important, so important so that people can worship as they choose, Jews, Muslims, and all Christians, and all religions.
Free societies have all got to meet the great challenges we face in ways consistent with values. That's what I'm here to tell you that's in my heart. That's what I want you to know about this administration, that we're not only committed to fighting terrorism—and we will. We are. We were under attack in America.
In Germany yesterday I said, September the 11th was just a fine—just as clear a dividing line in our history, in our Nation's history, as Pearl Harbor. It was. America at one time was protected by two oceans— we seemed totally invulnerable to, for example, the wars that took place here in Russia or on the European Continent—and all of a sudden found ourselves attacked, because we love freedom, because we respect religion, because we honor discourse. And you need to know that we're going to defend ourselves and defend that which we hold dear and, at the same time, protect civilization itself.
But in Afghanistan, we've shown, I believe, how to do it in a way that's commiserate with our values—that, on the one hand, we're plenty tough, and we will be. We've got a military we're going to use, if we need to, to defend freedom. But on the other hand, we delivered a lot of medicine and a lot of food. We hurt thinking not only that the children in Afghanistan could not go to school; we cried for the fact that people were starving in the country. We have rebuilt schools. We have also provided medicine and food.
Russia is building hospitals in Afghanistan. That's incredibly positive, we think. Nations are not only contributing military forces, but we're working to build a state that can function on her own, a state at peace in the neighborhood, and a state where people have got hope and a chance to survive, where moms and dads can raise their children in peace.
And that's important for you to know as well. You know, a lot of the time, people talk about the tough talk. But you've got to understand, we also have got a soft heart when it comes to the human condition. Each individual matters to me. Each individual has got worth and dignity.
The experience in Afghanistan has taught us all that there's lessons to be learned about how to protect one's homeland and, at the same time, be respectful of the— on the battlefield. And that lesson applies to Chechnya. The war on terror can be won, and at the same time, we have proven it's possible to respect the rights of the people in the territories, to respect the rights of the minorities.
We are—I represent a great nation, and Russia is a great nation. Both of us share a lot. We've got a big resource base. We've got people who are very smart. I remind Vladimir Putin that the great resource of Russia is the people of Russia. The resource of this country is the brainpower of this country. And when they get the system right, that encourages individual growth and entrepreneurship; that brainpower is going to flourish, and so will commerce, and so will opportunity. And while that happens, both nations must respect the multiethnic character of our lands. That, too, makes us great. And how we promote that multiethnicity, and how we respect human rights is another way we'll be judged by history.
We'll be judged by history on how we defend our freedoms. We'll be judged in history by how we help our people prosper and grow. And we'll be judged by history as to whether or not we defend the universal values that are right and just and true.
I want to thank you for that commitment to those values. I appreciate your stance for freedom. I appreciate your love of your country. I appreciate your understanding there is a universal and gracious God.
May God bless you all. May God bless Russia. And may God bless the United States. Thank you very much.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-community-and-religious-leaders-moscow
George W. Bush,"May 24, 2002",The President's News Conference With President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in Moscow,"President Bush. President Putin, thank you very much. Laura and I are so grateful for your hospitality and your friendship. It's an historic and hopeful day for Russia and America. It's an historic day for the world as well.
President Putin and I today ended a long chapter of confrontation and opened up an entirely new relationship between our countries. Mr. President, I appreciate your leadership. I appreciate your vision. I appreciate the fact that we've now laid the foundation for not only our governments but future governments to work in a spirit of cooperation and a spirit of trust. That's good. It's good for the people of Russia; it's good for the people of the United States.
President Putin and I have signed a treaty that will substantially reduce our nuclear—strategic nuclear warhead arsenals to the range of 1,700 to 2,200, the lowest level in decades. This treaty liquidates the cold war legacy of nuclear hostility between our countries.
We've also signed a joint declaration of new strategic relationship that charts a course toward greater security, political, and economic cooperation between Russia and the United States. Our nations will continue to cooperate closely in the war against global terror. I understand full well that the people of Russia have suffered at the hands of terrorists, and so have we. And I want to thank President Putin for his understanding of the nature of the new war we face together and his willingness to be determined and steadfast and patient as we pursue this war together.
President Putin and I agree also that the greatest danger in this war is the prospect of terrorists acquiring weapons of mass destruction. Our nations must spare no effort at preventing all forms of proliferation. And we discussed Iran in this context today. We'll work closely with each other on this very important issue.
Our nations also agree on the importance of a new NATO-Russia Council that will be launched in a few days in Rome. And Mr. President, this council is also a tribute to your leadership and your vision. For decades, Russia and NATO were adversaries. Those days are gone, and that's good. And that's good for the Russian people; it's good for the people of my country; it's good for the people of Europe; and it's good for the people of the world.
Russia and the United States are also determined to work closely on important regional challenges. Together, we will work to rebuild Afghanistan. Together, we will work to improve security in Georgia. We will work to help end fighting and achieve a political settlement in Chechnya.
Russia and the United States are committed to economic cooperation. We have launched a major new energy partnership. Private firms will take the lead in developing and transforming the vast energy reserves of Russia and the Caspian world to markets through multiple pipelines such as the Caspian Pipeline Consortium and Baku-Jihan. And I want to thank you for the cooperation and the willingness to work together on energy and energy security.
Russia is building its market economy, opening new opportunities for both our countries. I'm impressed by the level of entrepreneurial growth here in Russia. It's a significant achievement. Again, it's a testimony to the leadership of Vladimir Putin.
In a while, we're going to meet with Russian and American business leaders to discuss how we can continue fostering good relations and fostering opportunity. We want Russia to be a part of the world economy. We look forward to one day welcoming Russia as a member of the World Trade Organization. President Putin and I also agree that we'll work to resolve disputed areas of trading, such as poultry or steel, in a spirit of mutual respect and trust.
America welcomes the dramatic improvement in freedoms in Russia since Soviet days, including the new freedoms of Russia's Jewish community. In recognition of these freedoms, I am determined to work with Congress to remove Russia from the Jackson-Vanik amendment. It is time our Congress responded to my request, President Putin's desire, that the Jackson-Vanik amendment be removed pertaining to Russia.
I also discussed with President Putin the important role of free press in building a working democracy. And today we will meet with media entrepreneurs from both countries. It's an issue we discussed before. The President said it makes sense to have a forum where media entrepreneurs can meet and visit. And it's going to take place today. Mr. President, I appreciate that.
I am pleased with our relationship. I am confident that, by working together, we make the world more peaceful. I'm confident that, by working together, we can win the first war of the 21st century, and that is the war coldblooded killers—against coldblooded killers who want to harm nations such as America and Russia. And I'm confident that, when we work together in a spirit of cooperation on all fronts, both our peoples will benefit.
Mr. President, thank you for your hospitality.
President Putin. Distinguished American colleagues, distinguished Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, we've just accomplished the official part of our talks with U.S. President George Bush. Before our distinguished colleagues are the visit in Moscow and in St. Petersburg. But now we can name the major result of our talks—first of all, the logical development and practical implementation as seen by our agreements reached in Crawford last year. I mean the signature of the treaty between Russia on strategic defensive reductions and, first of all, this document.
It's the statement of our countries to reduce our nuclear arsenals and the joint work for nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. It's the decision of two states which are particularly responsible for international security and strategic stability. We're on the level of adopting the declaration on new strategic relationship which determines the basic directions in the security and international policy. It will have a positive impact for economic cooperation and development of our relations between the institutions of general public. And together with Mr. President, we discussed especially this aspect, the civil society between the people of our countries. The declaration formulates the principles of our dialog, anti-missile dialog; that is, the transparency and openness and exclusion of potential threats. We confirmed the Genoa agreement on offensive and defensive systems in all their aspects.
A separate issue, the mechanism of NATO-Russia cooperation within the framework of 20, it presumes a new level of joint responsibility and confidence between all its participants. I would like to stress, especially, that is the international novelty. And it happened because of the strengthening of Russian-American relations, including in joint confrontation to international terrorists—struggling with international terrorism. Russians work together with the American people in September the 8th, and we're grateful for sincere feelings of compassion headed by President Bush on behalf of American people because of the recent events in Kaspiysk. The memory of terrorism victims and the responsibility for the security of our people means joint struggle against this evil, as well as the struggle against nazism. The spirit of our cooperation will mean fruitful results even today.
That's why the agenda has very concrete issues of interaction against terrorism on the basis of unique standards against any manifestation of terrorism and extremism. We need close contacts through all agencies and services, including special services. Here we have very positive experience we've accrued over the past years. And we see today—we feel it today during the negotiations. The bilateral working group on Afghanistan has demonstrated its efficiency. And we, Mr. President, would like to transform it on a group to combat terrorism, especially chemical, biological, nuclear terrorism.
Russia and the United States are oriented to build new relations in economic activity. Our businessman mentality is much alike, that their qualities and their joint work is based on free trade and supporting the initiatives. That's why our task is to open new opportunities for business community.
We need to avoid obstacles of the past. Here we mean not only the market status of the Russian economy—and I'm grateful to Mr. President that he has given a very positive signal during our talks. And it does also mean such things as Jackson-Vanik amendment. We have to remove administrative obstacles, which encurls both countries, to cooperate, especially in the high-tech sphere, which determined the economy of the 21st century; that is, the aeronautics, telecommunications, science and technologies, new sources of energy. I would like to focus on energy, especially nuclear energy. We paid much attention to it today. And the large format of our cooperation will be a great element for the global economy on the whole.
I would like to stress, in conclusion, that, of course, not all ideas, not all initiatives, are on paper and in the form of official documents. But a serious move forward in all these issues is quite evident for us. Today, we together counteract global threats and challenges, and we're going to form a stable world order that is within the interests of our peoples and our countries. And I think it's in the interest of all the civilized human society.
Thank you.
President Bush. Name your agency.
Nuclear Arms Reductions
Q. I have a question for both Presidents, please. If we've truly entered a new era, why do you each need 1,700 nuclear weapons? And President Putin, why does Russia need to continue producing nuclear warheads? And to President Bush, why does the United States need to keep some 2,000 of these weapons in storage, ready for deployment?
President Bush. Yes. First of all, remember where we've come from. We've come from 6,000 to 1,700 in a very quick—or to 1,700 to 2,200 in a very quick period of time. You know, friends really don't need weapons pointed at each other. We both understand that. But it's a realistic assessment of where we've been. And who knows what will happen 10 years from now? Who knows what future Presidents will say and how they react?
If you have a nuclear arsenal, you want to make sure they work. It's—one reason that you keep weapons in storage apart from launchers is for quality control. And the thing I think it's important for you to know, Ron [Ron Fournier, Associated Press], is that we've made tremendous progress from the past. And the treaty is setting a period of time in the rear-view mirror of both countries. And I am not only confident that this is good for world peace; I'm confident this sets the stage for incredible cooperation that we've never had before between our countries.
President Putin. I concur with the assessment given by my colleague, Mr. Bush. And naturally, our position is well known. We are guided by the facts that it's more worthwhile, perhaps, to eliminate a certain part of nuclear potentials. At the same time, I'd like to point out another thing here. Any man who has at least once in his career dealt with arms, had arms in his hands, at least to hunt or a rifle or whatever, he knows that it's much better, much safer to have it in stock disarmed, disassembled perhaps, rather than to have it in your arms and charged with bullets in it and with your finger on the trigger at the same time. This is a different state of affairs, as it were.
And the fact that we agreed with President Bush regarding such détente, in such manner, this is a serious move ahead to ensure international security, which is a very good sign as regards the relationship between our two countries.
Now, as to why Russia should continue to produce nuclear arms, I'd like to say that this is not our priority. But in addition to Russia and U.S. out there, there are other states who possess nuclear arms. What is more concerning, there are countries who want to acquire weapons of mass destruction. Experts in the area of international security are aware of the fact, and they have been talking a lot about nuclear arms as deterrent.
Moreover, many of them assert—and it is difficult to dispute this fact—they say the existence of the nuclear arms was an impediment, an obstacle which contained the world from large-scale wars over the past decades, let's say. And I think we should take that into consideration while building a new quality of relationship within the two main nuclear states of the world.
We also should pay attention to the whole set of relations currently in the world out there, and we should take into account the prospects of development of the world in the realm of security, bearing in mind those potential threats I've mentioned here.
Jackson-Vanik Amendment/Russia-U.S. Economic Relationship
Q. Mr. Bush, when we can hope that Jackson-Vanik will be rescinded, which currently is very out of place? That's, you know, a remnant of the cold war here. And will the U.S. continue to use it as a leverage of applying pressure on Russia and when Russia will finally be recognized as a marketplace country? And what's the prospect of Russia's accession to WTO?
And now to Mr. Putin, Russian President. What's your idea of how U.S. Boeings can help Russian civil aviation?
President Bush. I couldn't make myself clearer during my opening statement about how I feel about Jackson-Vanik—not much action by the Congress of the United States, and I hope they act. The market-based economy is an issue that the President and I talked about. It is a regulatory matter, the responsibility of which resides at the Commerce Department. Secretary Evans and I have to talk about this subject, and we'll have an answer to the President soon.
And in terms of success of Russia ascending into the WTO, it's something that we want. It's in our Nation's interest that Russia be a part of the WTO. And we look forward to working with the President and respective ministers to see that that happens. It's in our interest that that happen. So it's hard for me to predict the timetables on all the issues you mentioned. Those over which I have got direct control will happen relatively quickly.
President Putin. Well, you know, while talking about the whole set of commercial and trade ties between our two countries, today we've mentioned more than once that we are facing somewhat an unusual situation in this area today, which has to do with the fact that while improving relations in disarmament matters, building confidence and so on and so forth, at the same time, we're expanding the whole set of relations in economic area. And naturally, we'll face new problems we never had to deal with before.
The position taken by the U.S. administration and the President is known to us as regards Jackson-Vanik. It's precisely the administration who initiated its rescinding. And business communities of our two countries, American and Russian business communities, and their interaction together with the interaction of the parliamentary issues, will be able to remove similar problems in automatic manner, I guess.
Now, as regards your specific question on purchase of Boeings, I must say that the best lobbyist of the interests of U.S. companies will be American President standing here, since both Boeings and poultry and other matters very often have been told by my colleagues. People usually say, ""Well, it's not on our level, but I must say,"" and then there will be a lengthy monolog on specific matters.
Anyhow, you've posed a very acute and very specific question. Why it's acute?— Because it's on the agenda—or practical interaction. And it's very specific since it has a bearing to very specific matters. And since it's acute and specific, I'll answer as one should in gentlemen's society, in a very general manner.
First and foremost, our carriers, in my opinion, should be primarily guided towards Russian aircraft producers. Why?—because Russian manufacturers, you know, don't have anywhere to sell their products otherwise, because they are not let anywhere— or with a lot of difficulty. They only can sell it domestically; that's the first thing. And here we can talk about interaction on the market.
Now, the second thing, our carriers, primarily Aeroflot, should be competitive on the market and should have advanced technology in their hands. Therefore, they both have American Boeings today; they also have European Airbus aircraft. And the question has been raised currently on additional purchase, on replacement of old equipment with those foreign aircraft.
Now, I should say, depending on the decision to be taken by economic structures— this is not a political question, mind you. The economic structure should decide on it. A lot will depend on it in regards of the state of our political interaction, of course. And our American colleagues' proposal today is a little bit costlier than the Europeans' proposal. Had Americans bought our cheap aluminum and steel, then their aircraft would have been cheaper and more competitive, including in our market.
So all of this jointly has been a subject of our discussions with the President here, and our good friend and partner, Secretary of Commerce and economy. And I think that in the course of normalization of trade and commerce relations, all these issues will be addressed in a most mutually advantageous manner.
Iran/Nuclear Nonproliferation
Q. [Inaudible]—state sponsor of terrorism. I wonder because of that, if these Russians sales that you object to continue, does that—this new strategic relationship you're discussing today bump up against what you outlined in your speech to Congress when you said, in the war against terrorism, you're either with the United States or against the United States?
And President Putin, the Bush team says that your sales of nuclear technology and sophisticated military technology to Iran are the world's single biggest proliferation problem right now. Do you agree with that assessment, and did you make any specific promises today in your meeting with President Bush?
President Bush. Well, first, we spent a lot of time on this subject. And as I said yesterday in Germany, I worry about Iran. And I'm confident Vladimir Putin worries about Iran, and that was confirmed today. He understands terrorist threats, just like we understand terrorist threats. And he understands that weapons of mass destruction are dangerous to Russia, just as they are to America. And he's explained that point himself, of course, now that he's standing here.
But we spoke very frankly and honestly about the need to make sure that a nontransparent government run by radical clerics doesn't get their hands on weapons of mass destruction. It could be harmful to us and harmful to Russia. And the President can speak for himself. And he gave me some assurances that I think will be very comforting for you to listen to. And I'm confident we can work together on this issue. This is in both our countries' mutual interest that we solve this problem.
President Putin. I will confirm what Mr. Bush has just said, and I agree with your evaluation of threats in this regard. Generally speaking, I believe that the problem of nonproliferation is one of the key problems as regards ensuring international security.
Incidentally, this happened to be one of the main motivating and underpinning logical stimuluses to work in Russia-NATO framework together on nonproliferation on nuclear arms.
At the same time, I'd like to point out that cooperation between Iran and Russia is not of a character which would undermine the process on nonproliferation. Our cooperation is exclusively, as regards energy sector, focused on the problems of economic nature. I'd like to point out also that the U.S. has taken a commitment upon themselves to build similar nuclear power-plant in North Korea, similar to Russia.
And in addition to Iran, I think, we also need to think about other countries here. For example, we have some questions concerning development of missile programs in Taiwan, in some other countries where we've been witnessing active work of producing mass destruction weapons and their carriers. All of that should be a subject of our in-depth discussion both bilaterally and in the frameworks of NATO-Russia agreement. That's one of the key issues of the modern times, I believe.
It would seem to me that in order to be efficient, in this sense, like in other areas, we need to address the main task, to upgrade confidence mutually. And today I mentioned to President Bush here that as regards Iran and some other countries, according to our data, the missile programs of those countries, nuclear programs, are built largely on the basis of the technologies and with the support of the Western companies. We do have such info, and we stand ready to share it with our American partners. So if we pursued that way, not dealing with generalities, then we'll get results with respect to this very complicated and very important for our two countries track.
And the conclusive question—[inaudible].
Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty
Q. Mayak Radio Station. To both Presidents, to what extent the treaty ensures real nuclear parity, and are there conditions that the treaty can be terminated by either side? And how true is the fact that Russia still remains as one of the nuclear targets for nuclear forces? And how does that relate to the announced new strategic relations between our two countries?
President Bush. Well, it is a treaty. This document is a treaty that will be confirmed by the United States Senate and the Duma, hopefully. Secondly, treaties have always had outs; there's nothing new about that. There are conditions of which things may change, and people get out of treaties. That's the way it's been. The Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty had an out; there's nothing new about that. And thirdly, you know, we are going to work to end the—forever end the cold war. And that begins with the statement that Russia's our friend, not our enemy.
And you say ""targeting""—I mean, the idea of our weaponry—our military has no aims at Russia. There may be old vestiges in place, but Russia's not an enemy. You don't think about how to deal with Russia the way they used to. Russia is a friend, and that's the new thinking. That's part of what's being codified today.
President Putin. As regards the parity, the parity relationship of sorts, the weight of military potentials and nuclear potential, and so on, so forth, each state would have its own strategy of development of what you refer to as nuclear deterrent process. But I'd like to assure you that all the action undertaken by us in this area fully confirmed with the interests of the Russian Federation. The documents signed today are a result of joint effort of the Minister of Defense and Chiefs of Staff and our Minister of Foreign Affairs, of course, jointly with our American colleagues. And we proceed from the assumption we have today, and we try to forecast the status of affairs in the world for a lengthy period of time—I would like to point out, again, for a lengthy perspective.
Now, as regards the question of verification and control, perhaps, I'd like to point out that we're very much satisfied with the U.S. administration approach to this question. Our American partners have agreed that we need to retain START I, which is provided for by the system of verification. We agreed we will continue this work on the basis of the documents signed today as well.
And what was the second part of the question, incidentally? The mike was off at this time. Regarding those targets, that was not to me. I will also make a remark here, regarding aiming targets. And Mr. Baluyevskiy, our military First Deputy Chief of Staff, is here with us. He and his American counterpart are full aware of those things, targeting aims and other things involved, and what is the status today of those aimings and targeting. All in speculations in the press are nothing but expression of domestic political infight either here or in the U.S., just on the verge of the visit.
We are not being emotional here. We're not talking to the press, but as experts, we're full aware of that, and we have no concern whatsoever in this regard.
Thank you. Thank you for your kind attention and for your participation.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-president-vladimir-v-putin-russia-moscow
George W. Bush,"May 28, 2002",Press Briefing by Secretary of State Colin Powell,"Practica Di Mare Air Force Base
Rome, Italy
SECRETARY POWELL: Well, good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. President Bush is this afternoon finishing up what we believe has been a most successful and historic trip to Europe. In Berlin and Moscow and Paris, and now here in Rome, we have made common cause against the grave threats to our liberty, to the safety of our people, and to civilization itself.
In his meetings, the President consulted with Chancellor Schroeder, Presidents Putin and Chirac and Prime Minister Berlusconi on our mutual security agenda. President Bush always values this time with America's close friends and allies.
We agreed that we must all work together to defeat terrorism, to build peace in the Middle East and calm tensions in South Asia. Above all, we agreed we must continue to expand and deepen security relationships among the members of the community of free nations.
Last Thursday in Berlin, the President paid tribute to German solidarity with the United States. He acknowledged Chancellor Schroeder's leadership and the Bundestag's courage in making German participation in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan, and also the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, making that participation possible, a breakthrough for Germany.
In Moscow, Presidents Bush and Putin signed the most dramatic nuclear arms reduction agreement in decades. The President also had the opportunity to see the sweep of Russian culture in St. Petersburg, and watched the brilliance of Russia's future reflected in the faces of St. Petersburg University students.
In Paris, the President's meeting with President Chirac ran the gamut of global and transatlantic topics and yesterday, in a very moving ceremony in Normandy, President Bush, with President Chirac in attendance, honored soldiers, Americans, Europeans and others, who fell defending freedom so many years ago. And as the President noted, today's soldiers and today's citizens continue to draw inspiration from that sacrifice.
And then today in the Eternal City, the heads of state and government of the NATO Russia Council met in session for the first time. I'm sure you all were watching the last couple of hours of that first meeting, where leader after leader took note of the historic character of today's action. All of them pledged to work with Russia and this grouping, now At-20, to build greater stability within Europe and to make Europe an inspiration for the rest of the world as to how Europe can work together not only with themselves but with their North Atlantic partners, the United States, Canada and Iceland, in this new grouping At-20, that I think will be a grouping that has important issues already placed before it, important agenda items to work on as determined at a ministerial meeting in Reykjavik two weeks ago.
And I can assure you that President Bush intends for the United States to participate fully in the NATO Russia Council, to make sure it is not just a grouping where people can talk, but it is a grouping where people can analyze the issues of importance to the 20 and act on those issues. It will be a very action-oriented council, and I look forward to playing my own role in it, as well.
With that, I'll stop and take whatever questions you may have.
MODERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, we have another group of journalists downtown, so we're going to go back and forth from one question here to one question down there, via audio feed.
Q On the Middle East, are you now talking about offering a time table for Middle East peace, as a way to chart the way forward?
SECRETARY POWELL: Did everybody hear the question? I don't think we're getting it piped in.
The question was, is the United States prepared to offer a time table for peace in the Middle East?
What we're doing is executing the strategy the President laid out in his April 4th speech, where he talked about two states living side by side in peace -- a Jewish state, Israel, and a Palestinian state, Palestine -- living in peace and harmony with one another.
He talked about the end of terror, the end of violence, and he talked about the end of occupation and the end of settlement activities. And he also welcomed in that speech the active participation of the other Arab nations of the world who can play a role in helping the Palestinians to move forward.
We have been acting on that vision that the President put down on April 4th ever since. My trip to the region and consultations we have subsequently had with the Saudi Arabians, with the Israelis and a number of other leaders who have come to Washington and we have consulted with by telephone or by other means, and we are continuing with that work with Assistant Secretary of State Ambassador Bill Burns heading to the region from Washington tonight, where he will consult with more leaders on a political way forward.
He will talk to them about transformation activities taking place within the Palestinian Authority. Activities are already being generated from within the Palestinian Authority, as you may have noticed from today's newspapers. And later this week, I think perhaps Friday, Director of Central Intelligence, George Tenet, will be heading over to undertake security discussions with parties in the region.
When we get reports back from Mr. Tenet and from Ambassador Burns, and we consult with a lot of other people, we will start to integrate all this information and see what next steps should be taken, keeping in mind that we are committed to a meeting sometime in the summer. We will bring these threads together -- humanitarian economic development, humanitarian relief, economic development, restructuring of the Palestinian Authority, working with the Palestinians, the role of the moderate Arabs.
We will also look at political options to see what the two parties believe is possible at this time, and we'll see where that takes us. But we are not at this point prepared to table an American plan with specific deadlines of the kind that was just mentioned by the questioner.
Q Secretary Powell, it's David Sanger from the Times.
SECRETARY POWELL: Hi, David.
Q Hi. Early in the trip, Secretary Powell, the President said that one of the reasons we still keep some nuclear weapons -- 2,000 of them or so under the agreement -- is that you never know how things are going to change with Russia or with other countries.
Similarly with NATO, what have been the discussions internally and what is your vision of how NATO should respond if Russia turns in a different direction at some point in the future and becomes less of a partner and again a power that needs to be contained. And how does that fit into your new arrangement?
SECRETARY POWELL: Well, I really don't expect that to happen. I don't think we're going to see a rerun of this movie. The movie didn't play well the first time, and I see no reason why any future Russian leader with a state that is only, oh, roughly 55 percent of the size of the old Soviet Union would find it in its interest in any way to try to act in an aggressive manner. And, in fact, the experience of the last 10 years is that slowly but surely Russia is coming to the realization that its future lies to the West, and the West coming to the realization that its future lies also with Russia.
And so I am looking toward a bright future, and I think what we saw here today gives every indication that that bright future is achievable, it's not a dream.
At the same time, NATO was originally created for a political purpose, but also for a security purpose -- to defend the interests of the members of NATO, the charter members and those who have been added over the years. And NATO will be expanded, more members will be coming into it.
So the self-defense aspects of NATO will always be there, increasingly the capabilities that we have within the Alliance for its collective self-defense can be used for out of area activities, and that surely will be part of our discussion in the future.
We'll always have a hedge against uncertainty in the future, in our military forces and in the nuclear weapons that the United States will continue to retain. It is a hedge against the future, because there are other nations that possess nuclear weapons or might come to possess nuclear weapons.
I have been studying and training and dealing with nuclear weapons for a large part of my adult life, and I've seen the United States arsenal go from 29,000, when I was Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff 13 years ago, when I first took over, now heading down to a strategic arsenal that will only have 1,700 to 2,200 deployed warheads. That is an enormous achievement and it reflects a far more secure, a far better world than the world that existed when all of these weapons were on a hair-trigger ready to go back and forth against one another.
And so it is prudent for us to do this downloading, this restructuring of our military forces in a sensible way, patiently, over time, making sure that we keep a hedge against uncertainty.
I've also seen the size of our conventional forces go down significantly in the last 10 years because of the change in the strategic situation, the end of the Cold War. And we should, nevertheless, remember that there is always uncertainty in the future and it is appropriate for NATO as an alliance, the United States as a nation -- Russia as a nation -- to keep a hedge for that kind of uncertainty -- but not looking for conflict. Rather, the contrary, moving in an entirely new direction.
And I think you heard some of the former members of the Soviet Union speak to that, who are now members of NATO and welcome Russia into the NATO-Russia Council today. Mr. Havel, was I think particularly moving in his comments -- the Polish leader, the Hungarian leader, all took note of this remarkable change, a change that I think will continue to go in a positive direction.
Q (Inaudible) -- presence in Central Asia and Caspian area and Greece in the future?
SECRETARY POWELL: In Central Asia?
Q -- Asia.
SECRETARY POWELL: Well, as you know, our presence in Afghanistan will continue as long as our mission is not yet completed to search out al Qaeda and the Taliban. And we are examining what present requirements we might have in Central Asia. But the United States is not looking for bases. We think it serves our interest to work with the nations of Central Asia, to have access agreements, to be able to go into their nations at their invitation, to train with them and, perhaps if necessary, to help them in their own self-defense efforts, or for a mission that might come up.
And so those are the kinds of arrangements we're looking for. But the United States is not interested in creating bases in order to have a significant military presence in the region. But to have access into the region, and to be able to work with those nations of Central Asia that wish to work with us, that seems to be us -- to us to be a very stabilizing thing.
And the enemy is quite different than the enemy we were facing so many years ago. It's now terrorism, it's now smuggling, it's now illegal immigration, it's now drug trafficking. Those are common enemies that we all now have. And to the extent that our ability to have access into that region helps all of us defeat those kinds of enemies, then those kinds of access agreements are useful.
Q But do you prefer -- (inaudible) --
SECRETARY POWELL: Well, we are certainly in discussion with the Russians over the utility of having multiple pipelines coming out of this region -- the Caspian Basin, particularly -- and I'm sure we'll continue those discussions, but I'm not here this afternoon to talk about any specific pipeline or contract arrangement.
Q Mr. Secretary, can you tell us, sir, what type of issues the United States does not want NATO to discuss with Russia? And also, sir, to what extent do you see this new arrangement as a prelude to possible Russian membership?
SECRETARY POWELL: The issues we do want to discuss with Russia will include such items as counter-terrorism activities, nonproliferation activities, civil emergencies, air space management, crisis management, arms control and confidence building measures, search and air rescue activities, civil emergencies -- those kinds of things that are common to all 20 nations.
I hope that list will grow, grow significantly in the months ahead, as confidence is built up, as we understand how this council works, and as we have had some success with these initial items that we have decided upon.
With respect to NATO's responsibilities to its own members, members of NATO, Article 5 collective security arrangements, those kinds of issues, then obviously Russia would not be included, nor would Russia wish to be included. And Russia finds this arrangement, the NATO-Russia Council, to serve its security interest, and its interest in becoming a more active member of the Euro-Atlantic community. The NRC serves that purpose, and I don't think Russia is considering at the moment applying for membership in NATO. But I will let that question remain with my Russian colleagues.
Q Two questions, if I may. Firstly, yesterday, the Russian Foreign Ministry reiterated its opposition to NATO enlargement. How is the Alliance going to react to this continuing opposition?
And, secondly, if I may ask you, how do you now characterize the war in Chechnya? Is that the final act of the Cold War, or a new front in the war against terrorism?
SECRETARY POWELL: With respect to the first one, I did see a statement that the Russian Foreign Ministry put out, saying that it continues to oppose enlargement of NATO. That does not surprise or shock me. It's been the Russian position for some time. But there is also no doubt that NATO will be inviting other nations to become members at the Prague summit, later this year.
As we have said all along, and as we've discussed with the Russians quite candidly, Russia cannot have a veto over who becomes a member of NATO or not. I also believe that because we have had this series of successes in dealing with Russia -- the NRC today, the treaty that the President signed a few days ago, the Treaty of Moscow, the political statement that the two Presidents signed in Moscow the other day, to go along with the treaty -- I think we have succeeded in making the enlargement of NATO once again less of a problem for the Russians, and less of an irritant in our relations. Russia knows that these invitations will be extended at Prague and, nonetheless, Russia is here today to participate in the signing of the NATO-Russia Council. And so I don't think it will be a major problem when the time comes to extend the invitations at Prague.
With respect to Chechnya, Chechnya is an area of enormous interest to the international community. Russia is fighting terrorists in Chechnya, there's no question about that, and we understand that. But at the same time, we believe that a political solution is really what Russia also needs to find a way to achieve. And we have always said to the Russians that in their prosecution of this campaign against terrorism, they have to make sure that the troops participating in it and other elements of the Russian armed forces and security forces have to meet the highest standards of human rights that one would expect from a civilized country.
And so that is what we discussed with the Russians. And in return, they let us know how serious they view this terrorist threat in their country.
Q Mr. Secretary, this is the President's first trip to Europe since you said that you'd have a word with some of your European allies about their concerns over U.S. policy in Europe. What's the administration learned during this trip of the state of those concerns?
SECRETARY POWELL: I think we've learned a lot on this trip. We've learned that the President has very solid relations with all the countries we visited, and I think for that matter, with all the countries we didn't visit, but who are represented here today.
That does not mean that there are not disagreements. There are disagreements over such issues as the Kyoto Protocol, the International Criminal Court; and there have been other disagreements, as well. But I think we have been very, very forthcoming in our efforts to discuss with our friends in Europe, either in the NATO setting or in the European Union setting, what our positions are, why we feel the way we do about some of these very controversial issues.
With respect to the ICC, for example, everybody has known for years that the United States had problems with the International Criminal Court, and even if it was signed, it would probably not be sent for ratification. And President Clinton made that clear when he signed it.
And so I don't think one should view an issue like that as an example of the United States essentially turning its back on its friends in Europe. Quite the contrary. We listened, we heard, we explained back to our European friends why we could not move in that direction to go along with them on the ICC. And so where we believe that we have a principle we must hold dear to, and as long as we are in discussions with our European friends, that should not be viewed as unilateralism or just going our way; we have a disagreement. And just because we are part of a great alliance and we are part of the Euro-Atlantic community does not mean that every issue we can join the consensus on.
If one looks at what we did with the Treaty of Moscow, the strategic reductions that we entered into the other day with Moscow, and go back a year or so when everybody said the United States was going off on its own and if we abandoned the ABM treaty, we were going to start an arms race, we took 10 months to discuss that issue with the Russians, discuss that issue with our European friends. We made the case, some people agreed with the case, some people did not. But it wasn't a case of the United States not sharing, not talking, not listening. And we listened, and tried to convince everybody that the ABM treaty was an anachronism and it would not destroy strategic stability.
And as a result, we left the ABM treaty. It will become formal next month, the leaving of it, but we announced it in December. And at that same day that we announced it, Mr. Putin said he would cut his strategic forces. So rather than causing an arms race, it's going the other way. I see no indication that the Chinese are going to break out in an arms race because we've left the ABM treaty.
And so where we have a principle position, what we will do is explain that principle position to our friends, try to see if we can find compromises, so we can join consensus. But where we can't join consensus, because of our own beliefs, or because we believe a particular issue and the direction it's going with others does not serve the purpose intended by that action, the United States will stick to its principle position.
And I think we go home from Europe with everybody having a better understanding of this way that we will do business: consult, talk, meet. I spent a lot of time with my European colleagues -- Don Rumsfeld does the same thing, Dr. Rice does the same thing. We'll continue to do that.
But we'll also continue to stick with those positions that we believe are the right positions and the principles positions. And the President is that kind of a leader. And he speaks clearly, he speaks directly, and he makes sure people knows what he believes in. And then he tries to persuade others why that is the correct position. When it does not work, then we will take the position we believe is correct. Where it does work, and we can join consensus with the rest of our friends and allies, that's what we'd like to do. And I think we come home with a better understanding of that, and I hope the Europeans are left with a better understanding of the way in which we want to do business.
Thank you.

George W. Bush,"July 12, 2002",Interview With Polish Journalists,"The President. I'm looking forward to our state dinner. It's a chance for me to, on a personal level, repay the favor of my friend Aleksander for his great hospitality to Laura and me when we visited he and Jolanta there in Warsaw. Secondly, it's a chance to say to our country and the world how important our relations are with Poland. We really think—respect the Polish people. We've got great numbers of Polish Americans who still love the motherland. And it's going to be a wonderful occasion to build on a great relationship, make it even better.
We will discuss a lot of topics. We'll talk about the war on terror. Poland has been a great friend and supporter, member of the coalition on the war against terror. We've got troops in the—on ships off the Indian Ocean. We've got engineers in Bagram, shared intelligence. Aleksander has been a strong friend and supporter. I'm confident he'll want to talk about NATO expansion. Perhaps I'll leave that for a question.
But all in all, we've got great relations, and I look forward to having a good conversation with a leader I respect. And I respect Aleksander Kwasniewski.
Why don't we start with you, sir.
Democracy in Poland
Q. Thank you. Mr. President, about your talks with President Kwasniewski next week, Poland has been viewed by your administration as one of the most successful examples of democratic transformation. However, the current Polish Government is taking some steps and adopting some laws which would obviously limit independence of media and central bank, which are the pillars of democracy. So are you going to raise these issues with the President?
The President. Well, first of all, I've got faith that a democracy will work. And I am confident that the Polish Government and the Polish people will come up with the right answers to issues relating to any law. I will—of course, if he asks my opinion, I will remind him that an independent media is a very important part of democracy. It's one of the pillars of democracy. I value our media, as an aside, saying that of course to pander to the people here that cover me on a daily basis. [Laughter]
But I do value a free and open media, and I think it's an incredibly important part. But your opening statement was true. We value the progress that Poland has made and the example Poland has set in a neighborhood that was a pretty tough neighborhood for awhile. And I was most impressed, when I went to Warsaw, to see the spirit of the people and the optimism. I understand the country is going through tough times, but all countries go through tough times.
President's Upcoming Visit to Troy, Michigan
Q. Mr. President, you're taking Aleksander Kwasniewski—it was your decision to go to Troy, Michigan, to meet with Polish Americans.
The President. Yes, we are.
Q. What is the reason for that meeting, and if you could tell us, what is your message to Polish Americans?
The President. Well, first of all, the message to Polish Americans is, I respect and honor the Polish traditions and Polish heritage. Actually, there was a—even in my own State of Texas, there is a community or two that Polish Americans have settled in Texas and still retains many of the great traditions and heritages.
It also reminds people that even though they have got a Polish heritage and embraced Polish traditions, they're Americans. It's a great part of the American experience. We envelop and welcome people from all walks of life. That in itself is an important statement to constantly make in our country. It reminds people of the strength of the country.
I've decided to go to Troy, Michigan, because it's going to be a—I hope it's a fun trip for Aleksander. I mean, I think it's important—I understand what a state dinner is like. It's formal. You'll see; it's going to be a grand day. They arrive on the South Lawn. The military will be there. There's a lot of pomp and circumstance. It's an exciting ceremony; it really is. And then there will be the formal dinners and the black tie, and the people will come, and the entertainment and the food—it's going to be great.
But there's more to a good American experience than just a formal dinner. I try to wear a tuxedo as little as possible, I want you to know. But flying out there to Michigan, the heartland of the country, with our friend, is going to be great. And he's going to see a big, enthusiastic crowd. It will give him a chance to say some things. And I think that's important to provide him a forum, so that he can not only be seen in a tuxedo but be seen speaking his mind about whatever issue he wants to talk about to an American audience that is made up of people from his homeland that have now settled in our country. I think it's going to be a great event. To me, it helps complete the state dinner aspect of the trip.
U.S. Economy
Q. Mr. President, I talked to Mr. Kwasniewski just before yesterday.
The President. Yes. How is he doing?
Q. Great. He looks good, in good shape.
The President. Looking forward to a 3mile run? [Laughter]
Q. He told me that one of the topics he would like to touch on is the recent financial scandals in the U.S., because they are a kind of backlash on Central Europe, and the recovery is difficult. And there's this feeling outgoing that the U.S. Government is not doing enough to change its own rules to really prevent the backlash for a Central European——
The President. Yes, I'll explain to him we are doing things, and I will be glad to lay out the initiative I talked about— and have been talking about, by the way, since March—February and March and then the speech I gave in New York. And of course, our House has acted—the House of Representatives acted, and the Senate has acted. And if he looks at what I proposed and what the Senate has proposed and what the House proposed, there's not much difference. And in other words, the point is that a bill will come out that will hold people accountable for accounting error—accounting fraud and, as we go forward, hopefully set an example—make it clear to people, there will be a consequence if they continue to do that.
There are markets—three things affect our markets, I'll explain to Aleksander. One of course is confidence and the numbers, and we're addressing that. Secondly is the war on terror. People are still—you know, realize that America is still a target. And the American people know that we're doing everything we can to protect the homeland and run down these killers wherever they try to hide. And that's all they are, by the way, just nothing but a bunch of cold-blooded killers. And thirdly, the corporate sector—the profits are beginning to improve, but the price-earnings multiples— in other words, the price of a share relative to its earnings—was very high, and the market is adjusting. So all three of those factors are important.
And obviously we—that's not the whole picture of our economy, and that's what Aleksander has got to understand. The market reflects part of it, but our unemployment rate is—looks like it's steady. It has stopped rising. As a matter of fact, it had a drop, and it's level. Our consumer spending numbers are up. Our manufacturing orders are increasing. In other words, the recovery is beginning to show some strength. So therefore, what I'm going to ask him is to look at the entire picture.
Finally, we've got good monetary policy and good fiscal policy here in Washington, and that in itself is part of long-term recovery. And so he'll hear a man who is—recognizes that we're making some progress. We've got to do more, but I'm pleased to report to him that I think things are going to get better. The foundation for long-term growth has been—is in place.
War on Terrorism
Q. Mr. President, I wanted to ask you a question about the war against terrorism. The Europeans seem to less and less support the war against terrorism. And I wonder if you could explain to us, why do you think it's happening, and if you are ready to go alone on this next phase of the war, whatever the phase is?
The President. No, I don't feel that the support from Europe is lessening. As a matter of fact, I've just come from a G- 8 meeting in Canada where, to a person, they were very supportive of our war on terror, because the Europeans recognize that the terrorists could strike them just as easy as they could strike us. We've still got great intelligence sharing amongst our nations. We've got good police action. We have hauled in—""we"" being the coalition— has hauled in—that means arrest—2,400, more than 2,400 terrorists. So we're picking them off, one by one. This is a different kind of war.
I use every chance I get, when I speak to the American people, to explain why this is different. And so—as opposed to destroying lines of tanks or shooting down airplanes, success is measured by—one by one, one person at a time. And the European leaders understand that, and they've been very supportive. They still—I think we've got about 8,000 troops in Afghanistan—we do, in the Afghan theater, and there's another 8,000 troops from other nations there as well. So it's a firm commitment.
I will continue to communicate and consult with our friends and allies as to every stage of the war, as the battlefront shifts. By the way, the battlefront isn't shifting out of Afghanistan. We're there. We'll remain there. We've got a lot of work to do there. There's still Al Qaida killers there. And of course we'll need to continue to have deliberations with our friends and allies, and we'll have them for future theaters and different operations. We talk to them all the time.
Poland's Purchase of New Fighter Jets
Q. Speaking of war, Mr. President, Poland is going to buy new fighter planes——
The President. Yes, I understand that's the case.
Q. Yes. And the F-16s are one of the——
The President. I've got a suggestion for them. [Laughter]
Q. However, President Kwasniewski just 2 days ago—you kind of—was kind of complaining that maybe the American offer is not meeting enough—expectations. So is——
The President. He's negotiating in public. [Laughter]
Q. Is your administration in any way going to support U.S. companies to win the standard——
The President. We will offer a fabulous product——
Q. Fabulous product.
The President. ——called the F-16. And we will work with our friends to make— you know, to compete on an above-board basis, totally above-board. And you know, we hope the Polish Government picks quality. If they do, they will, of course, come our way. But that's up to the Government. Aleksander will be and the Government of Poland will—you know, we will respect the process and respect the country and appreciate it's a tough decision and hope they make the right decision as far as we're concerned. But that——
Future Role of NATO
Q. Mr. President, do you think that the NATO will play as important role for the United States in the present century as it played in the previous century?
The President. Yes.
Q. And do you think it is possible that Russia one day will become NATO member?
The President. Interesting question. First, I do think NATO is very important. It's obviously a different role. NATO served as kind of a bulwark in defense against Russian tanks storming across the European Continent. Those days are over. Russia is no longer the enemy. I witnessed the fact that not only have we got good relations with Russia, but the very same trip that I—when I went to Moscow to sign this treaty that literally redefined our relationship from one of distrust and—like it was during the cold war, to a new relationship, shortly thereafter we went to Italy and welcomed a new relationship between NATO and Russia. So the whole relationship has changed for the better.
NATO has—and I think it's going to be very hard—very important to work that relationship with Russia, to allow for the— the new relationship to develop and mature. And I think it will in a very positive way.
The new relationship—the new role of NATO is—really needs to adjust to the new realities of the 21st century, and that is how to best fight the war on terror. And that means a different configuration of the use of our forces and the use of assets. Our forces need to be lighter and quicker to strike, and elite units need to be prepared to move at a moment's notice.
The enemy has changed, and the battlefield, the nature of the battlefield has changed. And therefore, the NATO mission must remain the same, mutual defense. But its tactics must change. And I think NATO is very relevant, and we will be an active and engaged partner in NATO.
Let me just—I'll ask myself, ""Well, Mr. President, do you think we ought to expand?"" [Laughter] I gave a very important speech in Warsaw. It's interesting—I hope the people in the world that are interested in our opinion on subjects noted that the speech was in Warsaw. And the speech was about a Europe that's whole, free, and at peace. And I talked about the expansion of NATO, and I said that I am interested more rather than less. And at the same time, I urged the applicant countries to take nothing for granted, to work very hard up until the last minute to show those of us in NATO that they'll be willing and active and capable partners.
And I look forward to our meeting in Prague. I fully understand the position of the Polish Government. I've had long discussions with Aleksander on the subject of NATO expansion, and I think people know that I'm forward-leaning, depending—if the member countries, you know, meet their MAP requirements.
Polish and U.S. Central Banks
Q. I want to go back to the finances and the limit. There is an attempt in Poland to limit independence of central bank, so it would be more—be manipulated more by Government, so Government would have more influence over central bank. In the current situation, what's your feeling about this?
The President. Well, first of all, I don't know all the facts about how the Polish democracy is handling this particular situation. I can tell you, however, from my experience, that a central bank should be independent. And the independence of our central bank gives Chairman Greenspan and the other Governors of the Federal Reserve great credibility in our country, to know that decisions are being made apart from politics. And our central bank is a part of— is a very important part of our—has been and will continue to be a very important part of the economic vitality of our country. It also gives investors who look at our country great confidence to know that the monetary supplies be not based upon politics, but the decisions on monetary supplies will be based upon the vision of some very wise people.
I think, when people look at how capital moves into countries, the independence of a central bank is an important part of attracting capital. And Poland needs to attract capital investment. If anybody were to ask me my advice on the central bank, that's what I would give.
President's Popularity in Poland/President's Vacation
Q. I'd like to ask you about different subject. According to the latest polls, you are the most popular foreign politician leader in Poland.
The President. Really? I usually say I don't believe in polls, but I may have to change my mind. [Laughter]
Q. With the same approval rate as President Kwasniewski. And I want to ask you to comment on this, and——
The President. Well, how high is it?
Q. Would you be willing to visit Poland again?
The President. Seventy-three?
Q. Why don't you go to Poland?
The President. Again?
Q. On holiday.
The President. Thanks. I don't know what to say. I appreciate that. I'm flattered.
Q. Are you willing to spend a vacation in Poland? With your parents, obviously?
The President. With my parents? I don't know if my mother could stand that. But listen, when I vacation, just kind of know about me, I like to be with my family, and I like to be in Texas.
I just recently went to Maine. I'd love to go to Maine, too, to be with my mother and dad. But my favorite vacation spot is my own ranch in the State I love. And I like to get out and fool around on the land, and it doesn't matter how hot it is or how cold it is. How hot it is and cold it is matters to those who have to follow me. For me, there is no day hot enough or cold enough. [Laughter] These poor souls—Crawford in August. That's my idea of vacation.
Although I must say, I had a great time up with Mother and Dad this weekend, and I love to be around them as well. But this August, I'm going to go down to Texas and actually work out of Texas. I'm going to travel quite a bit. After all, we're getting into the political season here in America. We've got our elections in November of 2002.
September 11/War on Terrorism
Q. Mr. President, we talk a lot about how September 11th changed the world, changed America. Has it changed you?
The President. Changed me?
Q. Yes.
The President. I don't think a single event can change anybody's basic values. It obviously changed the fact that I knew that my time as the President would be dedicated to winning the war on terror and protecting our homeland.
This is—I keep telling people this—it's just a different type of war, because much of the movement of the enemy is invisible to the American people and/or to the world. And yet we know they're there. The killers on September the 11th had been in our country for a period of time. They behaved normally. They looked normal. They, you know, were nonthreatening. It was hard to tell that they were part of this unbelievably evil plot.
And it—we're concerned that another group are here or somewhere, not only here but in other countries in Europe. And so the task is an all-consuming task of protecting our homeland and making sure we do everything we can here to find out if anybody is here and who they are and disrupt their plans and, at the same time, hunt down their leaders.
The wars of the past had known battlefields, and it was clear that such-and-such had to happen. There had to be an invasion in order to achieve this or that. This is a hunt for individuals. We're chasing down one person at a time. They were foolishly collected up at one point in time in the Shahi-Kot Mountains, and it was a tough chore. But our brave soldiers, along with coalition soldiers, were able to go in and score great success at bringing them to justice, as I like to put it.
They're wise to our ways. They realize we're a heck of a lot tougher than they thought. They assumed America was a weak country, that we didn't really believe anything. And they're finding out that's not the way we think. And so I realized after 9/11, after I got over the grief, along with everybody else in our country, that this was a long, very important struggle.
And the struggle goes beyond just fighting an Al Qaida-type network. I have deep concerns about the development and deployment of weapons of mass destruction, and so should you, so should anybody who loves freedom, because there are nations in the world developing these weapons who hate freedom, leaders hate freedom. And what we cannot allow happen is these nations to develop these weapons and then blackmail us and/or use them.
We will have—a judgment will have missed history's call to freedom. And so I realize that this war is going to consume a lot of my time. On the other hand, these members of the press know that I am optimistic person who truly believes that we can achieve some positive things out of the evil done to the country and to the world.
So when I talk to our friends, like Aleksander and others, I remind them of this call. We're leaders in a significant moment in history, and we can't blink, and we can't—we must be determined and focused to achieve this important objective, which is peace for our children, is what we're really fighting for, civilization.
Yes, ma'am.
Free Trade
Q. Mr. President, you always said that you are supporter of removing the trade barriers.
The President. Yes.
Q. Why do you think there are so many of them still exist?
The President. Well, you know, because I think the temptation is to be protectionist. And it's easier to mollify constituencies with protectionist rhetoric. Poland suffers from protectionist policies in parts of Europe, as you know. I'm a strong believer in free trade. I want the Congress to give me what's called trade promotion authority. I will exercise that diligently to open up markets.
On the other hand, I have an obligation to enforce law. And so I recently said that the—I listened to an International Trade Commission ruling on steel. The ITC ruled that excessive steel imports were affecting our industry in a negative way. I put a temporary measure in place, which exempted, by the way, Poland. And that was a chance for the steel industry, our own steel industry, to get on its feet. But nevertheless, as I reminded members of the European Union, this only represents a very small portion of the $2 trillion of trade we have each year.
But protectionism, for some, is a viable economic remedy. And in my judgment, protectionism would be bad for the world and bad for our country.
We're opening up—we sent our man to Doha to commit to the next round of the World Trade Organization. And unlike Seattle, where it all fell apart, we were able to—""we"" being those of us in the world who support free trade—were able to move the process farther down the line. And I will continue to work for free trade. It's in our Nation's interests and the world's interests that we trade. It's in the developing world's interest that there be trade. And our country is—we've got what's called AGOA, agreement with the African countries. I'm working on a free trade agreement with Central Americans. I'd like to see a free trade agreement from Canada all the way down to Argentina.
As I say, there's protectionist tendencies that occasionally rise up. We've just got to convince our respective people that trade is in their interests.
Russia-U.S. Relations
Q. There is another President you have such a good relationship; it's President Putin.
The President. Yes.
Q. Very good working relationship, on terrorism, on oil. But there is this feeling also this is in cost of some human rights, human rights in Chechnya, press freedom in Russia—it's overlooked now—and probably some freedom of some other Russian republics. Don't you worry that this close relationship is putting your—raising other problems?
The President. No, a close relationship with Putin allows me to make the case that, on media freedom, for example—as a matter of fact, on my last trip there, I urged him to interface with media entrepreneurs from America to understand how free press actually works, something that they're not very used to in Russia. And so there have been dialog interchanges now with some of our media executives. And I do push Vladimir Putin on the need to have open media and open his media.
And secondly, in terms of Chechnya, I'm constantly talking to Vladimir Putin about relations with Chechnya and understanding and supporting minority rights. The other issue that is very important, to which we do not turn a blind eye, and which I'm deeply concerned, not only about minority rights, is proliferation, matters of proliferation. I think we're making some progress there.
The immediate concern was proliferation to Iran, and I brought that up with Vladimir every time I visited with him. It's a very important issue that he understand that an armed Iran could be very dangerous to his own country, much less to our friends the Israelis or America, itself. And we've had some very important exchanges on that.
In terms of helping make Russia a more secure place, we're working on what they call 10-plus-10-over-10: $10 billion from the U.S., $10 billion from Europe over 10 years to help secure some weapons stockpiles. Vladimir is very interested in working with us to decommission some of his nuclear submarines to make Russia and the world more safe.
In other words, my only point to you is, is that by being closer to Russia, we're able to deal more directly with some of the thorny issues that could separate us and could in fact make the West less likely to deal with Russia.
And we've got another issues at home here that has upset a lot of our people, and that's chickens. Fortunately, we're arguing over chickens and not over war, over chickens and not over missiles, like we used to. But a lot of people here feel like there was a commitment made to let U.S. chickens into Russia. And they started moving into Russia, and all of a sudden they stopped moving into Russia. And so I've been—so whether it be trade or minority rights or press, our relations are such that we're able to bring those up in a very frank and forthright way and yet still moved a very important relationship forward.
Look, friends don't always agree, but friends are more likely to be able to work things out than enemies. As a matter of fact, in the old days, if there was a disagreement between enemies, that could lead to war. And there won't be a war between Russia and the United States.
Situation in the Middle East
Q. Mr. President, a question on another very easy subject, the Middle East crisis.
The President. Yes. [Laughter]
Q. What solution do you see to the crisis, and what compromise do you expect from both sides?
The President. Yes, that's a very good question. First, I do believe that we can achieve a vision of two states living side by side, at peace with each other. And that's the vision, and that's what all policy must aim toward. It starts with understanding that it's going to be impossible to achieve that vision if terrorists are allowed to have a free run and blow up the process.
An incredibly important step toward the vision of two states living side by side is for the international community, including the Arab world, to work with us to develop the institutions necessary for the emergence of a Palestinian state that will be transparent; it will respect rule of law; it will have a constitution that will allow for a sharing-of-power arrangement; that will have institutions that outlast—are far more important than any single one person.
And we're in the process of working toward that end. Colin Powell will be meeting with what the call the Quad in New York. Foreign Ministers from the Arab world will be coming as well, later on, to work on the step-by-step process toward the emergence of a Palestinian state. And I repeat, that requires a constitution, a judiciary, transparency when it comes to financial conditions. And I believe there's financial aid available. I know there is.
[At this point, the tape machine stopped.]
The President. Something just ground to a halt. That thing had, what do we call it, a skidding halt. Sounded like it needs some new tires.
Anyway, the international community wants to help with aid, but they're not going to help with aid if it's going to be stolen. Let's put it very bluntly. And so the——
[The tape machine stopped again.]
The President. ——the press conference has clearly gone too long. [Laughter]
So we're working to get these institutions in place. Obviously as security improves, Israel is going to have to, as I said, pull her troops back to September of 2001— 2000 levels. In other words—not levels but geographic—within geographic boundaries of September 2000. They're going to have to deal with the settlements. In other words, all parties have got responsibilities. The Arab world has got responsibilities, by the way, as well, to help on the development of a security force necessary—a security force, by the way, which must exist to enforce security, not enhance the status of a single person.
So we're making progress. It requires a international commitment and a focus on a positive end, which is two states living side by side in peace. As I said, I'm an optimistic fellow and believe that if we stay at it and keep working hard, we can get there. But there's no question in my mind, as I said in my speech in the Rose Garden recently, that there's going to be some setbacks. But our Nation is committed to a peaceful resolution of the conflict.
All right, well, thank you all.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-polish-journalists-0
George W. Bush,"August 24, 2002",Statement by the Press Secretary,"The United States is deeply concerned about credible reports that Russian military aircraft indiscriminately bombed villages in northern Georgia on August 23, resulting in the killing of civilians. The Government of Georgia and border monitors of the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe have verified that these aerial bombardments occurred. The United States regrets this loss of life and deplores the violation of Georgia's sovereignty.
The United States strongly supports Georgia's independence and territorial integrity, and has welcomed similar statements by the Russian Federation. Yesterday's attacks and their denial by the Russian Government, however, belie such Russian assurances and escalate existing tension between Russia and Georgia, just as cooperative arrangements for resolving regional security problems are emerging. In this context, we call again urgently for a political settlement to the conflict in Chechnya, which would contribute to stability in both Russia and Georgia, and advance our efforts to fight terrorism and establish peace in the Caucasus.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-the-press-secretary-257
George W. Bush,"October 29, 2002",Press Briefing by Ari Fleischer,"James S. Brady Press Briefing Room
 12:35 P.M. EST
 MR. FLEISCHER: Good afternoon. I do not have any opening prepared, so I'll be happy to begin with questions. David.
 Q: Ari, on the federal charges in the sniper case, given the Republican belief in state control in so many matters and that all wisdom doesn't reside in Washington, why, with no obvious federal interest, has the federal government decided to file charges and potentially take the case away from the local jurisdictions?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I think it's appropriate for anything involving law enforcement decisions, that the appropriate authorities be the Department of Justice to explain any actions they may be taking in this matter. I think they'll be more than happy to answer any questions about it. But anything about this would come from the Department of Justice.
 Q: But can't the President defend his decision taken by his Justice Department?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I have not personally talked to the President about this, but decisions about jurisdictions in court cases are typically things that are decided by prosecutors and professionals, and not decided by the White House. And so this is a matter for the Department of Justice to enter into their professional judgment about how justice can best be served.
 Q: But the facts are that the President was made aware, blow by blow, what was happening in the investigation; he spoke about this publicly. But now he's not prepared to talk about why the federal government has to step in and take a case away potentially from the jurisdiction in which the crime was committed?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, I think it's an obvious separation for the President to be kept informed about what is happening as the sniper is on the loose, and to make certain that the federal government is doing everything it can to catch them. But once they're caught, the President understands that it should be delegated as far as the decision-making about professional Justice Department decisions on how to prosecute a case.
 Q: One more. Does politics play any role in the decision made to have a Republican U.S. attorney and a Republican Justice Department take it away from local Democratic officials?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, given the fact that you've got so many jurisdictions involved with Democrat and Republican officials alike, I think you can obviously see --
 Q: The biggest jurisdiction is a Democrat.
 MR. FLEISCHER: Obviously, this is being done on the basis of what the law enforcement professionals think is the appropriate way to proceed.
 Q: Ari, the President's U.N. resolution spells out clear deadlines for Saddam Hussein, and a clear timetable for inspections that could lead to war. The President at every campaign stop across America talks in a hypothetical fashion about what should happen if that U.N. resolution would fail, that he'll lead a coalition to disarm Saddam. What are the deadlines and timetables for the backup plan?
 MR. FLEISCHER: The President has not indicated there are hard deadlines as such. I think that it's clear from listening to the President speak that the end is coming near. The United Nations is still hard at work on this matter. They have made some progress, and it's still unclear what the ultimate outcome will be in New York.
 Q: Perhaps I wasn't clear. My question was, what are the deadlines and timetables for his backup plan? That is, acting with either congressional authorization or existing U.N. authorization.
 MR. FLEISCHER: Again, the President has not established any hard deadlines. And again, let's see what the United Nations does before I'm prepared to discuss anything that could be an alternative.
 Q: Would they be similar to the U.N. deadlines which is seven days to comply, 30 days for a full list of weapons of mass destruction, 45 days for inspectors, and 60 days for --
 MR. FLEISCHER: The President is still working through the United Nations. Let's see if the United Nations is able to get the job done or not.
 Helen.
 Q: Does the President think that it was right for Putin to gas his own people, and do we know what kind of gas was used?
 MR. FLEISCHER: We still do not have any information yet about the exact nature of the gas that was used. Embassy Moscow is working to ascertain that information. As for the President and his thinking about all of this, the President feels very strongly that responsibility for this rests with the terrorists who took these people hostage and put them in harm's way in the first place. That's where the President believes the fault lies.
 Q: He thinks then, therefore, it was okay to use gas -- I mean at any cost?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Helen, the President abhors the loss of all life in this instance. And the President makes no mistake about who is to blame for this -- the people who put people in harm's way, or the terrorists who took the lives --
 Q: I'm not asking who's to blame. Does he think it was right to use gas, or does he think there were any possible alternatives?
 MR. FLEISCHER: The President understands that in this circumstance -- you had terrorists who had proven that they were going to kill, who had already killed, who were deadly serious about killing more, who had 700 hostages, who had the theater booby-trapped and were prepared to take mass quantities of life. The President views this entire matter as a tragic one, but it's a tragedy that was brought on as a result of the terrorists who put people in the way.
 Q: The answer is yes?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I'm addressing it as the President approaches it.
 Q: May I follow up on that? A couple questions on that. When America was struck on the 11th, the first call I think we got from a foreign leader was President Putin. Why hasn't President Bush called President Putin immediately after a significant terrorist event in his country?
 MR. FLEISCHER: He did, Ron. President Bush called President Putin immediately upon the taking of the hostages and offered America's support, and said that we'll stand with you during this period. So he indeed did.
 Q: Okay, sorry about that. Did the President or have any of his people asked the Russian government what type of gas was used in the siege that has affected three or four Americans?
 MR. FLEISCHER: That's what I indicated earlier; that's being worked through Embassy Moscow.
 Q: And again, have you gotten any further reading on what the U.S. reaction is to the fact that the Russians won't tell us what type of gas was used that may have hurt or killed Americans?
 MR. FLEISCHER: We're continuing to work that through, through the State Department and through embassy officials.
 Q: You don't find it surprising or frustrating that Russia just doesn't say, here's the answer? Why are they dragging their feet?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I have not heard it be characterized by the President, so I would hesitate to do so myself.
 Q: This morning you told us that the United States was consulted by Russian security services in advance of the raid. About what? What was the nature of those consultations?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I looked into the question that I got earlier, and to the best that I've been able to determine, there have been -- there was no advance notice to the Americans about the raid, no advance discussions to Americans about the nature of the raid, what it would entail, the type -- the gas. Obviously we still don't know what the gas was, so there was no -- nothing that I've been able to discern that would lead anybody to that conclusion.
 Q: But there were advance consultations about the situation?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Yes, there were. There was discussions as soon as the hostages were taken, which I think you expect any time there is any type of incident around the world, there's a tendency to information-share about anything that could be helpful. But nothing at all that I've been able to glean along the lines that I was asked this morning.
 Q: And then do you know what extent -- what the extent of U.S. programs involving this kind of weapon, this kind of gas that was used in --
 MR. FLEISCHER: I don't know specifically, Terry. What I can tell you is that the Department of Defense does have a variety of programs involving non-lethal systems, in a host of areas. I think many of these have been public before. I know there has been interesting stories in the press, for example, about foams, non-lethal foams that can be used to immobilize people, weapons that shoot nets to trap people, things of that nature that can be used in different types of military situations.
 Q: And gasses?
 MR. FLEISCHER: You'd have to talk to the Department of Defense about any of the specific, individual programs that they have. I'm not familiar with each and every one of them.
 Q: And just one on Iraq, quickly. The President, in the stump speech that John referenced, also says if the United Nations won't act, if Saddam Hussein does not disarm, the U.S. will lead a coalition to disarm him. Who -- what nation, aside from the United Kingdom, has publicly committed to join such a coalition?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, I was asked this question about two or three weeks ago when the President first started talking about this. And, one, make no mistake, that if the United Nations fails, international action will still follow. The only issue at that time will be the fact that the United Nations wrote itself out of any international action.
 I think, Terry, what is appropriate now, in the President's judgment, is for the U.N. to proceed. Let us see if the U.N. is able to do the job or not. If they are not, then I think you will have no questions about who will proceed with the coalition the United States and others will form. I think at that time it will be appropriate for those nations to be named. But at this point, the President is still content to work through the United Nations. We'll see where ultimately that goes.
 Q: Right now no public commitments aside from the -- even the United Kingdom, I guess, has said that unless --
 MR. FLEISCHER: You can rest assured that what the President said is based on the information he has gotten as he talks to other nations. But again, because the President went to the United Nations September 12th and said that he wanted to work with the United Nations for days and weeks, not months -- while time is running out in New York, they still have some time left to get the job done.
 Q: Why is time running out?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I'm sorry, Helen?
 Q: Why is the time running out?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Because I think that everybody at the United Nations -- the people who strongly support the President's position, people who are still trying to figure out where they are, and those who may oppose -- for example, like Syria -- they all recognize that it's getting time to bring this to a conclusion.
 Q: Why has time run out for North Korea?
 MR. FLEISCHER: It's a totally different circumstance. It's being handled differently.
 Q: No, it's not.
 Q: What international -- what other international action are you referring to? Would it be military force? You said there would still be international action if the U.N. fails.
 MR. FLEISCHER: The President has said repeatedly on his speeches that if the United Nations fails to take action, the United States will assemble a coalition that will force Saddam Hussein to disarm.
 Q: But don't Americans have a right to know if they're going to send their sons and daughters into battle, who else in the world is going to make a similar commitment? Why do we have to wait until the U.N. either strikes out or succeeds?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I think the President, as he indicated, wants to work through the United Nations. And people will know, but I --
 Q: But the President is the one raising this issue, saying if they fail, then we and a coalition of nations are going to go get him. So, okay, why can't we know who else that is?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Let's see first if the United Nations is capable of getting it done.
 Q: But the President puts a wall between those two.
 Q: Ari, are you waiting for the midterm elections to be over before you bring this U.N. resolution to a vote?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, the timing is ultimately going to be decided by the diplomats who are involved in it. And this will either take place this week or next week, depending on what the status of the talks is.
 Q: So domestic politics are not at all a concern?
 MR. FLEISCHER: No. I thought -- reporters have raised that question with me before, and frankly, this is a matter, I think, that if somebody wants to say, why are you voting on it the week before the election, if the vote is the week before the election -- they're going to ask that question. If they want to say, why are you voting on it the week after the election, if it's voted on the week after the election, they're going to ask that question. I fail to see how anybody can make the case that voting on it before or after benefits one party or another. The vote will be decided by the diplomats in accordance with the progress of the talks. It just so happens there is an election at the same time.
 Q: You don't think forcing a vote on a U.N. resolution before an election might scare off some voters, make voters nervous?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Elizabeth, it's not the United States that's dragging its feet. The United States went up to the United Nations on September 12th. If this could have been resolved weeks ago, I think the President would have been very satisfied.
 Lester.
 Q: Ari, you and the President have emphatically described Islam as ""a religion of peace"" -- emphatically. And in connection with that, have you heard of any public protest by any peaceful Islamic organization of what President Putin described as international Islamic terrorists in Moscow, and more of them in Bali and Israel, New York, the Pentagon, and by a Nation of Islam member, in Maryland, D.C. and Virginia?
 MR. FLEISCHER: You lost me, Lester.
 Q: No, have you heard any protest from the peaceful Muslims that you refer to, as a religion of peace? Have you heard any protest of these atrocities?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Protest in which atrocities, Lester?
 Q: All of these atrocities -- in Moscow, Bali, and elsewhere -- have you heard any protests?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Lester, I am not a protest tracker except for when I travel with the President. Then I look out the window.
 Q: Why is the use of our military to protect the skies above the District of Columbia justified when the use of U.S. troops to seal all of our borders is not being done, and an illegal immigrant from Jamaica named Malvo who was arrested by the U.S. Border Patrol was released by the INS?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Lester, one of the eternal issues that makes our country great is our openness to people from other countries. And since September 11th what we've realized is that we need to make certain that people who are not supposed to come to America, that we redouble our efforts to make certain people who don't belong here cannot get in here. By the same token, one of the things that makes us a free country and a strong country and a great country is the fact that we welcome people from other nations to this country.
 And along those lines, I was remiss, I should have noted this at the beginning. The President this morning spoke with President Mubarak of Egypt by telephone. The President consulted with President Mubarak on efforts to promote resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, including the recent trip of Assistant Secretary Burns to the region to follow up on the President's message about the importance of achieving a road map to peace in the Middle East. They talked about the issue of Iraq. The President reiterated his desire to settle this in a peaceful way, but make no mistake, that the important goal was the disarmament of Iraq.
 President Mubarak was on a trip to Morocco as the two spoke and the President also sent his regards to King Mohammed.
 Q: Ari, Putin said, in dealing with the Chechens, that this was a part of the global war on terrorism. And earlier today you were asked whether or not the administration agreed with that position. You said, to the extent that al Qaeda is in Chechnya and the rest of the world. Considering that Russia has given assistance to our war on terrorism, would the White House, would the administration consider offering intelligence or personnel or training regarding going after al Qaeda, say in Chechnya?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, we already do provide the information sharing. That is a two-way street, and very productively so. It's one of the interesting things about the end of the Cold War, and the growing relationship between the United States and Russia. We do share information with Russia in our mutual effort to fight terrorism. In addition, I'd remind you that in support of putting an end to terrorist activities in and around Chechnya, the United States is providing military training and equipment programs for Georgia, particularly in the Pankisi Gorge, a neighbor of Russia that's involved -- the hostilities have been coming from areas that are particularly centered around the Pankisi Gorge.
 Q: Considering what the President has said about the use of poison gas recently, are there some circumstances in which it is okay to use it?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, again, I think that it's important to find out first what exactly was the gas that Russia used. And it's impossible to characterize it beyond that unless we know.
 Q: On the U.N., Hans Blix and Mohammed El-Baradei briefed the Security Council yesterday. What was the significance of their testimony? What is your view of what they told the Security Council about the regime for inspections?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, the briefing that was done by two of the leaders of the inspection regime was very notable. It was notable for what it said about the importance, in their judgments, about having -- these are my words -- but a tough and effective resolution so they can go about and do their jobs. They did both express a concern about going back into the country in the absence of a clear, strong resolution.
 In addition, when they were asked about whether or not the resolution needed to have the words ""material breech"" in it, they did indicate -- and I want to find the verbatim on this to be precise -- but a reporter asked Dr. Blix, will it help you if ""material breech"" will be defined in the resolution? And his answer was, ""I think it helps us if Iraq is conscience that non-cooperation will entail reactions by the Council.""
 They both were diplomatic in stating that it is up to the United Nations Security Council to settle the exact words and make any determinations from that point forward. But that's a very notable statement about the inspectors themselves believing they think it helps if Iraq is conscience that non-cooperation will entail reactions by the Council. I think the last thing the inspectors want to do is go in there and be led around again in more cat-and-mouse games. They want to do their job, they want to disarm Saddam Hussein.
 Q: -- Russians had objected to the inspections regime in the U.S. and British resolution, saying that they were unrealistic and unimplementable. Does the U.S. now believe that any of the Russian concerns have faded away, or at least been softened by the Blix and El-Baradei --
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, again, what keeps striking me about this whole process at the United Nations is the swirl of words, some of which are repeated privately, some of which are not; some of which are said publicly for no other intention or purpose than to be said publicly. And that's the nature of diplomacy. That doesn't apply to only one nation, that simply is how these things sometimes go. So the real action will remain action behind closed doors and the Security Council, and we'll see where that leads. No one has a clear picture of it yet, but ultimately it will go.
 Q: One last detail on the timing. What -- it's not the elections, it's not other things, what is it? What does determine the timing of the vote?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I think it would be determined by a conclusion by the diplomats that all other options have been exhausted, that there is no more room for discussions, that all discussions have led to the most fruitful point that is allowable, and that it's time for people to put up their hands and vote.
 Q: In Asia, Japanese officials have now opened a dialogue with North Korea about that country's nuclear weapons program. I wonder if you could give us an update about efforts to bring diplomatic pressure on North Korea on that issue, and when will the U.S. begin to talk directly with North Korea about the concerns Mr. Bush had?
 MR. FLEISCHER: The President is, one, gratified about the support that he has received from President Jiang Zemin of China, as well as President Koizumi -- Prime Minister Koizumi, and President Kim of South Korea over the weekend. The President thought the remarks at the -- by the leaders, particularly their call publicly for North Korea to immediately dismantle its weapons program, was constructive.
 Now what will happen is this is going to shift to the ministerial level. And you will see continued talks among the United States, South Korea and Japan, as well as China and Russia, about how to proceed. And we will ultimately find out what North Korea's intentions are, whether or not they see their way forward in the world in a world of cooperation or in a world of isolation. The President hopes it will be in a world of cooperation.
 Q: Is there a role for the U.S., though, in the near-term? You mentioned the regional --
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, we'll see. We'll see exactly what the -- what type of talks, if any, will ensue. But the United States thinks it's appropriate for Japanese officials and South Korean officials to be in touch with their counterparts in North Korea. They will do so, appropriately so. But the United States will remain firm in calling on North Korea to make certain that it dismantles its weapons programs.
 Q: I want to make sure I understand your answer about the question on the Moscow raid. You said that there were advance consultations on the hostages. Did any of those consultations between American and Russian officials regarding the hostages get into the area of what the Russians might or might not be about to do to free those hostages?
 MR. FLEISCHER: To the best that I've been able to learn in the inquiries that I have made, I have no information that would support that the United States had any advance knowledge of the tactics that would be used or the nature of the raid.
 Q: To your knowledge, there was no American input of any kind into --
 MR. FLEISCHER: How it transpired?
 Q: Right.
 MR. FLEISCHER: No, I have not been able to determine that from anybody I've talked to.
 Q: One more on Chechnya, if I may. I understand your answer that the President believes that the main responsibility for the violence rests with the Chechen terrorists. Does the President believe that the Russian armed forces bear any responsibility for driving the Chechnens to terrorism, given the tactic that Russian armed forces has used since 1994 in Chechnya?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, the President's position toward the conflict, itself, in Chechnya has been loud and clear, and that is, the best solution and the ultimate solution to the dispute in Chechnya is a political one. And the President has made that point repeatedly, publicly and privately with Russian officials.
 Q: I understand that, but the question is, there is a history to this thing. Chechen terrorism didn't begin, didn't, sort of spring full grown from someone's brow. Does the Russian armed forces, does the Russian government bear any responsibility for driving some number of Chechens into terrorist actions out of desperation, given the kind of tactics that the Russians have used?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Ken, I can tell you something as powerfully, as unequivocally as I possibly can from the President of the United States: There is no excuse for terrorism in any part of the world by anybody for any reason, no matter how worthy they believe their political goals. No matter how much any individual or group thinks that their political goals are more important than anybody else's -- there is no excuse to engage in terrorism innocent civilians and taking people hostage as the means of trying to achieve their political goals.
 Q: And in the President's view there's no connection between the tactics that the Russian armed forces have used --
 MR. FLEISCHER: Again, your question supposes that the Russians are to blame for the terrorists taking Russian citizens hostage. And the President does not share that. The President knows that the people responsible, the people who shoulder the burden and the blame are the terrorists. And there is no excuse -- around the world, in any region -- for people resorting to terror against innocent civilians to achieve their civilian goals.
 Q: Does that include the past, Ari?
 Q: Ari, does the administration take comfort in the strong words that President Putin said about now really waging a war on terrorism? And as part of that, I mean, does it ease their opposition to what we're trying to do with Iraq?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Larry, I don't know that I can say that the President takes comfort in hearing these strong words. I think, frankly, the President's first reaction is sorrow that other nations around the world are being victimized by terrorists, whether it's President Megawati in Indonesia and the people of Indonesia and the people of Australia, or whether it's the Russians now and President Putin. I don't think the President welcomes the fact that other nations are facing up to some of the same issues that we faced up to after September 11th, because they are now victims of people who are killers and murderers.
 I think the President does recognize that the world does see how global this terrorist threat can be, how important it is for us to work together with our allies and friends on a common approach to terrorism.
 That's one of the positive outcomes of the APEC summit that the President just left in Mexico, where the nations of the Pacific are talking about how to work together to protect against terrorist threats. It's one of the reasons there was an initiative there to -- just like in Canada, at the recent G-8 summit -- to bind our nations together, where United States Customs officials will go to ports abroad to work collaboratively with our friends in those ports to prevent terrorists from using foreign soil to reach American soil.
 So in some ways, the world is joining as one in the fight against terrorism. But no matter what has caused a nation to step up to its fight of terrorism, the President expresses sorrow that innocent lives are taken as the world steps up.
 Q: And do you see it as having any kind of implications for the situation with Iraq and Russian cooperation?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I have not heard anybody make that case, so I can't say it.
 Q: If I can change the subject for a moment. Earlier, it was announced that the President will be traveling to Florida this weekend to do some campaigning. I was wondering if the President's brother, the Governor, has assured the President that there will not be any voter irregularities, or that the voter irregularities that popped up in the primaries about two months and, of course, in the 2000 elections, have been remedied. Has that conversation taken place?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I'm not privy to every discussion the President has with his brother. But I can assure you that in all 50 states I think every governor hopes that, regardless of party, that any type of election problems are kept to as absolute a minimum as humanly practical. Clearly, there are many lessons to be learned from 2000, and the state of Florida reacted to them and has provided tremendous amount of funding and resources to the various counties throughout Florida as a result of that. I think other states, as well, have done their best individually to respond to what happened there.
 This race is, of course, the number one target for the Democratic National Committee, as said by the Chairman of the Democratic National Committee. They said this is their number one target, their number one goal is to defeat Governor Jeb Bush. And we'll see ultimately what the outcome of that race is.
 Q: An unrelated follow, if I may -- and I apologize if this was asked of you yesterday, while you were on the road. The Justice Department has released its uniform crime statistics. It shows an increase in crime, the first in 10 years. I was wondering if the President has been made aware of that and what the White House feels may have caused this spike upward?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Let me -- I'll have to take a look and see if the President has. I saw briefly a report on those statistics this morning, but I have not seen an evaluation of the causes for it. Let me see if I have any evaluation I can offer, and I'll post it.
 Q: Yes, Ari, two questions. The first one has to do, a week from today we're going to have elections in this country. And one of the states that is very tight, as pollsters tell us, is Minnesota. Today, a special service is being held for Senator Paul Wellstone. Is the President going to visit Minnesota after today, to help the Republican nominee?
 MR. FLEISCHER: We've announced our schedule through Saturday. We'll
 have additional announcements over the next day or two, and we'll keep you filled in about anywhere the President may go.
 Q: Is that an option?
 MR. FLEISCHER: All 50 states are options. And, as you know, we have a regular practice of fully informing you as the decisions are finalized and as it gets closer to the events.
 Q: Another question. When President Bush, according to you, called President-elect of Brazil da Silva, and told him he looks forward to working with him, especially with regard to advancing democracy, good governance and free trade in the hemisphere. It's been the practice here, many times the President-elect visits Washington and meets with the President before he takes office. Being that Brazil is such an important component of the economic situation of our hemisphere, especially South America, is President Bush going to meet with President da Silva before he takes over?
 MR. FLEISCHER: During the conversation, the President extended an invitation to President da Silva to come and visit the United States. And of course, clearly, it still is the term of President Cardoso in Brazil, so at the appropriate time he will review his schedule in Brazil and I'm certain that the two will meet somewhere.
 Incidentally, I said all 50 states are options. I should back up, it may not be fully the whole gamut of all 50 being options, but many are.
 Q: Hawaii. (Laughter.)
 MR. FLEISCHER: Hawaii? Do I hear Hawaii, John Roberts?
 Q: And Alaska.
 MR. FLEISCHER: And Alaska.
 Q: Just on that very point, I just want to ask, could you explain, what is the sensitivity to talking about campaigning in Minnesota? I mean, obviously, it's something -- I don't want to give you the answer, but -- (laughter.)
 MR. FLEISCHER: The service is tonight for Senator Wellstone. And there will be a time for politics and there will be a time again as the people of Minnesota focus on the fact that there is still an election day scheduled. Today is not the day. Today is a day to remember Senator Wellstone.
 Q: Ari, can I follow up on what you said earlier about words that are being said at the United Nations that are being said for the purpose of being said? I'm wondering if you're telling us that those diplomats are sending a signal of disunity that really is playing into Saddam Hussein's hands. Those diplomats -- you were talking the debate and some of the public statements --
 MR. FLEISCHER: Is what playing into Saddam Hussein's hands?
 Q: Some of the public statements at the United Nations Security Council, which you suggested didn't mirror what was happening in private --
 MR. FLEISCHER: Right.
 Q: -- are sending a signal of disunity on the Council that's playing into Saddam Hussein's hands.
 MR. FLEISCHER: No, what I'm saying on that is that is obvious in any type of negotiation, particularly negotiation involving diplomats, there are various levels of discourse. Not all of the levels of discourse that are public are shared privately. And so there's always an attempt to trying to push the envelope farther out so that an ultimate compromise is closer to what somebody really wanted. That's the nature of negotiations. That's what I'm alluding to.
 I think the ultimate test about whether or not there is any signal sent to Saddam Hussein will come in its final form -- whether the United Nations has an agreement or doesn't have an agreement. That will be, indeed, a signal to Saddam Hussein. And that's why the President called on the United Nations to be the United Nations and not the League of Nations.
 Q: In light of Quest restating their earnings and consumer confidence a question at this point, what -- other than tax cuts, what does the President plan, or does he have any plans to think about stimulating consumer confidence in the economy?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, clearly, Congress has still left unfinished the business of terrorism insurance with the hundreds of thousands of jobs that that can create. And the President hopes that when Congress comes back for the lame duck session, they'll be able to finish the work on that. It got close, it didn't get finished.
 The President hopes that Congress will fully fund the budget priorities the President has sent up to the Hill, which are pending, particularly in the area of homeland security, which has money for bioterrorism defenses and for first responders' needs. There are many issues pending up there that Congress has to address. And once they're finished with these important priorities, the President hopes that they will hold the line on spending, because the President worries about the effect of deficit spending and overspending can have on fiscal discipline.
 The energy bill that is pending up in the Congress is also good for America. It represents energy independence. It also represents conservation. But the President still views the economy as the fundamentals remain strong; that the economy is not as strong as he would like it to be, but particularly, another area that can be effective is the acceleration and the making permanent of the tax relief.
 Q: Ari, the former head of the Mosad, Israel's intelligence agency, says ""World War III has started."" Considering 9/11 and the fact that the U.S. is now engaged in a worldwide war against terror, is he right?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, I don't want to get into a semantic issue. The President has said, of course, that we are at war. The President described the action following September 11th, against the Taliban and al Qaeda as phase one of the war. If you remember in, I think it was March of 2002, the President talked about the expansion to make certain that al Qaeda has minimized in its ability to reconfigure itself in places like Yemen and the Philippines and elsewhere. And the President clearly is concerned about global terrorism and people who would use terrorist means to harm our citizens either here or abroad.
 Q: This relates to my friend, Sarah's question. In the wake of the murder of the U.S. diplomat in Jordan, will the United States draw down Americans in nations where they are at risk? And will you assist in their protection? I know that you used the phrase ""take precautions,"" but that really doesn't help when the whole country is dangerous.
 MR. FLEISCHER: Connie, unfortunately, the State Department has a vast experience in dealing with how to protect Americans abroad. Fortunately, Jordan is not the first country in which Americans who valiantly serve our country -- either in the State Department, the Foreign Service, AID or any of the other number of agencies -- where people and their families move abroad to serve America are threatened. So these issues all get evaluated by the State Department, by their security personnel on the ground. I'm not in a position to give you any further updates from State. State will have that, based on their information.
 Q: What about warning Americans, private Americans, in a lot of these dangerous countries?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, travel advisories, again, that is all done by the State Department.
 Q: Ari, security issues are a major part of the President's standard stump speech. Does the President believe the country will be safer if both Houses of Congress were in Republican hands?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I think the President believes that the agenda that he believes in will have much more of a chance of passing if there were members of the Congress in both the House and the Senate who shared his view. And, clearly, when you take a look at what has not gotten done on the Hill this year, you can see a great many issues which would have gotten done if the House and the Senate had been in Republican hands. And so the President looks at this from a very broad picture and thinks that it would better for the country if many of the items on his agenda had enough support to get passed into law. So he is talking about, when he campaigns, the need to have a Republican Senate and a Republican House.
 Q: That he believes the country would be more secure if both Houses were in Republican hands?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, I think there's no question that if the Senate had been in Republican hands, the homeland security bill would have passed already.
 Q: Let's be clear about this, so we don't get calls back later on our leads. Were you answering the question yes or no? It sounds like you were saying yes.
 MR. FLEISCHER: I was answering the question that the President believes a broad agenda, including the creation of the department of homeland defense, would have more of a chance of being passed into law if the House and Senate had more people who supported the President's agenda. I'm not going to -- I think members of both parties have a desire to make America safe. I don't think anybody has questioned that. But when it comes to the purpose of campaigning, the President wants to elect people from both parties who support his agenda.
 Q: Is the United States committed to a U.N. vote and having a vote, even if it becomes clear that the President's position is not going to prevail?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, we'll see, ultimately, again, what happens as this thing heads down to zero hour. It's not there yet. It's approaching, but it's not there yet. And we'll see. I have not really heard if people have come to the final conclusions that if there is not enough support whether it should or should not go to a vote. I don't think people are looking at it that way yet, Ron. I think people are still trying to look at how we can put this together if we can.
 Q: So right now you're not committed to having an up or down vote
 --
 MR. FLEISCHER: No, I'm just saying I haven't heard any conversations about that level of tactical planning. The focus right now is still working with France and Russia and everybody else to get to the point where there is sufficient support for it to pass.
 Q: But if you've already acknowledged the possibility of defeat, wouldn't you also say what are we going to do if it looks like we're losing?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I think things are defeated because, one, either they're vetoed, two, they're not voted on, or three, they're defeated. And any one of those could be the possibility, or it could pass. And I don't think anybody is going to know which of those various possibilities will take place until probably shortly before the vote. In some ways, it's not unlike the Congress; when there's a vote, sometimes you don't know how it's going to go until the vote is called.
 Q: Ari, on the economy, you mentioned a few moments ago measures are pending in Congress that could help stimulate growth. There are other measures out there that are being talked about -- extending unemployment insurance, rebates, et cetera. However, there is a column in the Wall Street Journal today by Allen Murray which says that the best way to reinvigorate the economy is not by changing monetary or fiscal policy in any of these ways, but to end the business and investment uncertainty that now exists because of our Iraq policy. If I may quote, he says that, ""The best tonic for the U.S. economy would be a successful war or a bloodless end of the Saddam Hussein regime."" What is the administration's response?
 MR. FLEISCHER: Well, the administration's response is that in the event that there is any military action in Iraq, it's not going to be driven by economic considerations, it's going to be driven by the need to protect the American people from the real-life threat involving Saddam Hussein in his pursuit of weapons of mass destruction. That would be the factors that the President considers.
 Q: Do you believe, though, that in terms of business uncertainty, that a factor that contributes to it right now is this uncertainty as to whether or not the United States is going to war?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I think that a variety of economists have looked at a variety of factors in the economy and tried to determine what has created the economy that we presently have. And there's no unanimity among the economists -- and I'm not an economist, so I wouldn't want to venture into what the exact causes are.
 Q: Ari, getting back to the question on a U.N. vote, in his speech in September, the President -- and you've quoted this many times -- said it would be a matter of days and weeks, not months. And that takes us roughly to November 12th. Do you think that's an adequate time frame to work in? Can we expect to see a resolution --
 MR. FLEISCHER: That's why I was indicating earlier that the President would have been satisfied if the United Nations was able to address this issue and come to a conclusion earlier than they have. We are approaching the point where it's months, and the President said that he did not want it to go months. And so I think that --
 Q: Was that then just a figure of speech for him, or does he view that as a literal marker that the U.N. should abide by?
 MR. FLEISCHER: I have not heard the President give a hard date. But I think everybody sees that the United Nations is approaching decision time. And that, I think, is something that you hear from not only the United States, but from France and from other nations that serve on the United Nations Security Council. It's been a good debate; it's been a long debate; the time will soon come for the debate to end.
 Thank you.

George W. Bush,"November 13, 2002",Press Briefing by Scott McClellan,"The James S. Brady Press Briefing Room
 12:32 P.M. EST
 MR. McCLELLAN: Good afternoon. Let me start by running back through the President's day. The President started this morning having breakfast with the bipartisan leadership: Speaker Hastert, Leader Lott, Leader Daschle and Leader Gephardt, where they -- the President gave them an update on the war on terrorism and Iraq. And they also discussed the importance of getting the homeland security department legislation passed and to the President's desk before they leave. And they also discussed the importance of terrorism insurance and getting our hard-hats back to work.
 Then the President had his usual briefings following that. And later this morning the President participated in his Cabinet meeting. The President's Cabinet, as he noted, talked about homeland security, about strengthening our economy, as well about maintaining fiscal discipline. And he received a number of updates from his Cabinet Secretaries on various activities they're involved in.
 The President later this afternoon will meet with the United Nations Secretary General Annan, where they will discuss the U.N. resolution and the situation in Iraq, the Middle East, and development and security in Afghanistan as well.
 Then tonight, the President participates in the White House Symposium on the West Wing, which is to commemorate and celebrate the 100th anniversary of the West Wing.
 I would like to mention the homeland security department legislation. We are pleased with the progress that has been made. It appears that the congressional leadership is ready to move forward on this legislation and get it to the President's desk before they do adjourn. This legislation, as it is now, appears to be a strong -- this legislation appears to be strong and meet the President's requirements for a strong homeland security department. And we are hopeful the Congress will get it to him by the holidays.
 With that, I am glad to take your questions. John Roberts.
 Q: In it's 9-page letter to the U.N. Security Council accepting the conditions of Resolution 1441, Iraq makes the assertion that it has no weapons of mass destruction, that it is ""clean."" What's the White House's opinion on that declaration?
 MR. McCLELLAN: Well, John, I haven't seen what's in the letter yet. I've heard the reports and I would remind you that this was never a question of accepting or rejecting the resolution. The U.N. resolution is binding on Iraq and the Iraqi regime. Saddam Hussein had no choice but to accept the resolution.
 I would also remind you that we have heard this before from Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi regime. Now we need to see it by Saddam Hussein's actions. We need to -- the onus continues to be on Saddam Hussein. This is his choice.
 And I would go back through what the regime in Iraq needs to do: Iraq must provide a full accounting of all weapons of mass destruction -- the programs, materials and delivery systems -- within 30 days, that's what the resolution spells out; Iraq also must allow free, unimpeded, unconditional immediate access for weapons inspectors anywhere, any time, to anyone; and Iraq must also allow witnesses to weapons of mass destruction programs to be interviewed outside of the country and to bring their families with them; and Iraq must also stop firing on the U.S. and British aircraft patrolling the no-fly zones.
 Q: But this assertion that Iraq possess no weapons of mass destruction, does that seem plausible to you?
 MR. McCLELLAN: Well, John, again, I haven't seen the specifics of the letter, but the resolution clearly spells out for the regime in Iraq that any false information or omissions are considered a violation of the resolution and would be considered a further material breach. That's all spelled out in the resolution.
 But, again, I would reiterate that -- the latest reports that the regime in Iraq has agreed to cooperate and comply, that we have heard this before and now it's time to see it by their actions.
 Q: If they don't stop firing on coalition planes in the no-fly zone, is that a material breach?
 MR. McCLELLAN: I just indicated to you that part of the resolution calls for the regime in Iraq to stop firing on aircraft patrolling the no-fly zones. You're trying to get into ""ifs"" and hypotheticals and, as I said yesterday, I'm not going to get into every if and hypothetical. It makes clear in the resolution that if there are violations, that the countries, or the inspectors, are to report that to the Security Council where there will be further discussion about what consequences may follow. But just because there are discussions at the Security Council, I would remind you that that does not prohibit the President from using his authority to act with like-minded nations if need be.
 Q: Scott, you noted that Iraq has 30 days, or until December 8th, to provide a complete accounting of its weapons of mass destruction. It has; they don't have any.
 MR. McCLELLAN: Well, again, this letter apparently, I understand, has been delivered to the United Nations. We have not seen -- or maybe we are reviewing this letter as I speak, but I have not seen the contents of the letter. We'll look at the letter and we'll go from there.
 Q: Is the United States prepared to provide evidence to counter Iraq's assertion that it has weapons of mass destruction?
 MR. McCLELLAN: Well, again, they have a 30-day deadline to list and disclose all that information. I haven't seen the contents of the letter, so I don't want to jump into what I haven't seen at this point. But it's been made clear, if there is false information or omissions, then that would be considered a violation.
 Q: And saying that they had no weapons of mass destruction would be false information, according to the United States?
 MR. McCLELLAN: Well, again, I haven't seen the contents of the letter. So let's -- they have a 30-day time line to report all that information.
 Q: I asked you this morning -- Benjamin Netanyahu, running for leadership to the Likud Party, has said if elected he will expel Yasser Arafat. What is the U.S. position on the expulsion of Yasser Arafat by any Israeli government?
 MR. McCLELLAN: Terry, as I mentioned earlier, there are -- we recognize that there are elections upcoming in Israel, and the United States has a long policy of not getting involved in those internal domestic discussions that are going on within Israel. But the President's views are very clear; they were laid out in his June 24th speech when he outlined a road map to our goal of achieving two states living side by side in peace. And we're working with all parties in the region to implement that road map.
 But I'm not going to go and venture into internal discussions that are going on within Iraq.
 Q: So we have no position on whether or not --
 MR. McCLELLAN: Well, the President -- I think the President's views were fairly clearly spelled out in his June 24th remarks, and I would refer you back to those. But you're asking me to jump into internal debates or discussions that are going on in an upcoming election in Israel. I'm not going to do that.
 Q: Scott, there were also reports overnight that the -- that the United States and Israel agreed to put the road map initiative on hold pending the elections. Can you confirm that?
 MR. McCLELLAN: We remain committed to pursuing that road map and we are going to continue working with all parties within the region. I don't know which exact report you're referring to, but --
 Q: It was an Haaretz report, it said Dr. Rice and her Israeli counterpart agreed to this, I believe yesterday.
 MR. McCLELLAN: That may well be. I'll look at the report; I haven't looked at it.
 Q: Secondly, has the United States taken a position on the fuel oil shipment now on its way to North Korea? I understand there was a National Security Council meeting this morning that was to address that issue?
 MR. McCLELLAN: There was a National Security Council meeting this morning. As you know, we don't discuss the discussions in those meetings. And, as I would also point out, we do not comment on intelligence matters from this podium.
 But the United States has had consultations with the Japanese and the Korean governments. Assistant Secretary Jim Kelly has been in the region, as you're aware. And the executive board of KEDO, the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization, is meeting later this week to discuss how to proceed. And the executive board includes South Korea, Japan, the European Union and the United States. And we'll let those discussions proceed. We're working this through diplomatic channels, as you're aware.
 But one thing is clear to North Korea, we have made it clear to North Korea, that this is not business as usual: North Korea must dismantle its nuclear weapons program. We seek a peaceful resolution and we are going to continue to work through those diplomatic channels with our friends and our allies to keep maximum pressure on North Korea. If North Korea wants to be part of the international community, then they must dismantle their nuclear weapons program.
 Q: Apparently, the South Koreans and Japan are not willing to suspend these shipments immediately.
 MR. McCLELLAN: I've seen those reports and, again, we're continuing to work this through diplomatic channels. When there's more information, then we'll be ready to discuss it at that time.
 Q: Scott, as a general matter, does the President believe that deficits are bad for the economy over the long haul? And if he does, then does he believe a fundamental choice has to be made by the White House and by Republicans on the Hill between the notion of further stimulus to the economy in the form of tax cuts, or things like a $400 billion prescription drug benefit under Medicare?
 MR. McCLELLAN: Well, David, I remind you that the primary reason for the deficit that we are in now is the war and the recession. And I would also point back to what private economists have said, that the tax cut that was passed when we came into office was well timed. And it was because of the tax cut, it was a contributing factor that the recession was one of the shortest and shallowest ever. So we have continually made the point that surpluses don't create growth; growth creates surpluses. And so that's what I would go back to.
 Q: That doesn't answer the question, which is that it doesn't matter what happened on September 11th, the price of prescription drugs are still what they are and insurance is going to be what it is.
 So, given this climate, which is likely to get worse if there's war in Iraq, financially, does the President believe Republicans have to make a choice? Either we further stimulate the economy with a new round of tax cuts, or we do things like a prescription drug benefit on the Medicare? At the moment, Republicans are talking about accomplishing everything.
 MR. McCLELLAN: Well, David, I think there's a way to accomplish this. The President has a history of showing this, where -- and he talked about this a little bit earlier, where we can fund our priorities and hold the line on spending elsewhere. Then we can meet those important priorities that you just mentioned.
 We do need to continue to look at additional ideas, which the President is, to stimulate the economy. He is committed to working with Congress to create a new jobs and economic growth package early next year, and we are moving forward in that direction. At the same time, as he pointed out earlier, we need to get terrorism insurance passed. That's something the lame duck Congress can do before they leave. This will put our hard-hats back to work. It's a job creations measure.
 And tax cuts. The President has talked about making the tax cuts permanent to bring some certainty to people's minds there. Those are all important measures that we are pursuing. And then we're looking at additional ideas as well to work with Congress on.
 Jeanne.
 Q: Does the administration oppose the delivery of that oil shipment to Korea?
 MR. McCLELLAN: Well, again, I think I addressed it. We're working this through diplomatic channels right now. There is a meeting that is going to happen --
 Q: But what is the administration's position?
 MR. McCLELLAN: There is a meeting that is going to happen later this week, and we need to let the discussions happen at that meeting through diplomatic channels, not through media channels.
 Q: So you won't tell us what the position of the administration is on whether that oil should be --
 MR. McCLELLAN: Our position for North Korea is very clear. This is not business as usual, as I said. North Korea needs to dismantle its nuclear weapons program, and we are continuing to work through diplomatic channels to seek a peaceful resolution in the region.
 Q: On Harvey Pitt, anything new today on that or --
 MR. McCLELLAN: No. And as you know, I don't speculate on personnel matters.
 Q: And you won't be announcing any today? At least that one.
 MR. McCLELLAN: I don't speculate on timing or personnel announcements. Let me go to Jim. Oh, Jim and Jim. You guys figure it out. (Laughter.)
 Q: On Harvey Pitt, can you describe what the urgency is to filling that job, and then to filling the accounting oversight job?
 MR. McCLELLAN: Well, we are moving as quickly as possible. The President believes that the accounting oversight board needs to move forward quickly and aggressively on the work that it has before it. And we will work to find someone who has broad experience and is well-qualified, that can continue the efforts that the SEC has been working on to crack down on corporate wrongdoing. And we are moving as quickly as we can.
 Q: I want to go back to a material -- different question, if I can. You specifically mentioned the firing on U.S. and British planes in the no-fly zones. That is not something the inspectors have anything to do with, so one would not expect them to report back any violations. That would have to come from the U.S. and Great Britain.
 MR. McCLELLAN: Others are able to report, through the resolution, to report violations.
 Q: So you would consider any further firing on U.S. and British planes a new material breach?
 MR. McCLELLAN: Well, again, those matters, if they're violations, they go back to the U.N. Security Council for discussion.
 Q: Well, but we don't go back to the Security Council for definition, we just go back --
 MR. McCLELLAN: We're getting into ""ifs"" here -- but we made it clear that they need to follow that and not continue to do that.
 Q: Right, because it would be a new material breach if they were to fire?
 MR. McCLELLAN: Well, I don't have the resolution right in front of me that spells out specifically, but I'll refer you back to the resolution for that specific issue. But that is part of what Iraq needs to comply with, is not to fire on aircraft patrolling the no-fly zones.
 Q: And one other matter in the same regard -- that is, that they -- you talked about the declaration where they must fully declare any weapons of mass destruction they have. They've indicated they will say they are clean, as they said this morning. Do we consider a declaration -- since we believe they have weapons, do we consider a declaration, if they have none, to be a material breach, or must that be proven?
 MR. McCLELLAN: Well, what is considered to be a material breach is if there is false information or omissions about what they are required to disclose and to report.
 Q: And what is the proof of false information?
 MR. McCLELLAN: Well, that will be determined in discussions with the U.N. Security Council. That's what the resolution calls for.
 Q: Scott, two quick questions. One, same question yesterday, and today U.S. officials are saying -- other Bush administration officials -- that link between North Korea and Pakistan, Pakistan is the root cause of helping -- earlier, just a few months ago, and still helping North Korea in training, technology, like giving nuclear and getting missile technology.
 Now my question is that I hope President Bush is aware and reading all these think-tank and the reports and now all the cards on the table that (inaudible) Musharraf. And Musharraf is threat to the west and the United States and Israel as much as North Korea or Saddam Hussein, because (inaudible), what he calls. And, two, link with terrorists with Osama bin Laden and Taliban, and also against Israel. And their nuclear technology also I think in the hands of Osama bin Laden or his al Qaeda. So where do we stand now?
 MR. McCLELLAN: What's the question there?
 Q: The question is how do -- what -- U.S. is (inaudible) with link with the North Korea and Pakistan. What are they starting now and how -- what action, sort of action U.S. will take against Pakistan, because under U.S. law all economic and military aid must be stopped.
 MR. McCLELLAN: Well, the press has reported that a number of countries may have assisted North Korea in its efforts to develop a nuclear weapons program. I think all of those countries view how seriously we take such action and how serious we view any kind of proliferation activity that involves North Korea. And I would refer you back to Secretary Powell's comments on October 26th, where he talked about President Musharraf's assurances that Pakistan is not participating in activity of this nature.
 And I would again reiterate what I talked to you about yesterday. Pakistan has been a strong partner in the global coalition in the war against terrorism.
 Q: So there are no consequences for Pakistan having supplied North Korea with materials as recently as this past --
 MR. McCLELLAN: Well, if you go back to some of the Secretary's comments, he talked about how we are focused on now and the future. The past is the past. He -- Secretary Powell talked about that. But we will continue to follow the issue closely.
 Q: Just to follow. Former Prime Minister Pakistan is in town and she has been talking with -- meeting with U.S. officials, including the State Department. And she said that whatever pledges and commitment General Musharraf made to the United States and President Bush and the international community, he has not lived up to those pledges and he has broken all those commitments, including his government or Pakistan will be governed by the pro-Taliban and al Qaeda (inaudible), this week maybe. And she said that U.S. is making a big mistake toward Pakistan, General Musharraf policy and they must change it.
 MR. McCLELLAN: I think you have my response. I'm not aware of the details of the meeting that was had.
 David.
 Q: One question, just following up on your answer on North Korea. When you quote the Secretary of State as saying that we are focused on now and the future, of course, the law requires you, in terms of sanctions, to focus on the past. The law doesn't deal with future transactions.
 Are you suggesting there that the administration's position at this point is to ignore what happened in the past, not enforce that law?
 MR. McCLELLAN: I think I would leave it where Secretary Powell left it on October 26th, after he had discussions with President Musharraf. And specifically there, he said that President Musharraf assured him -- he said -- these are Secretary Powell's words: 400 percent assurance that there is no such interchange taking place now of any kind between Pakistan. And he was referring to now or looking ahead.
 And he said: we didn't talk about the past, we'll talk about now and the future. The past, as he said, is subject to intelligence analysis with sources and methods. And, as you know, we don't get into discussions of -- discussing those intelligence matters.
 Q: I didn't ask you to discuss -- to be --
 MR. McCLELLAN: I know, but you're asking me --
 Q: The response to -- the question is, does the administration plan to enforce the law that is on the books in this case? Or is the administration saying, no, we're only going to look at the future and not enforce the laws?
 MR. McCLELLAN: I think I addressed it by referring back to what Secretary Powell said.
 Q: Secretary Powell didn't refer to sanctions --
 MR. McCLELLAN: And I would remind you that September 11th changed the world and changed the behavior of many nations, as well. But we are looking at now and we are looking at future action, and we will continue to follow this closely.
 Q: Does September 11th mean that law is no longer in effect in terms of enforcement, is that what you're telling me?
 MR. McCLELLAN: I didn't say that, David. I think I addressed the question.
 Q: A quick question on Iraq, if I could. Is it the administration's intention -- if this letter says, as we believe it does, that there's no -- that there are no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, to provide in any public forum, to the United Nations or anybody else, some sampling of the administration's specific suspicions or evidence that, in fact, there is -- there are weapons of mass destruction?
 MR. McCLELLAN: Again, I haven't seen the contents of the letter, but stay tuned. We will work with the U.N. and provide what support we can to the inspectors. We will provide what intelligence we can, as well.
 Q: Scott, on another subject. In Nevada, 67 percent of the voters supported an initiative confining marriage to one man and one woman, while in his Florida debate with Bill McBride, Governor Jeb Bush, when asked if homosexuals should be prohibited from adopting children replied -- and this is a quote -- ""I believe they should. If you're going to have permanency, it should be with a loving couple that is man and wife."" And my question is, the President doesn't disagree with either his brother or the majority of Nevada voters, does he, Scott?
 MR. McCLELLAN: What was the statement again?
 Q: I believe -- this is what Jeb Bush, with 650,000 votes, he said when he was asked if they should be prohibited from adopting children, he said, ""I believe they should. If you're going to have permanency, it should be with a loving couple that is man and wife.""
 Now, the President doesn't disagree with his brother, does he?
 MR. McCLELLAN: I think the President's views are very clear on that issue, as well.
 Q: So he doesn't disagree. The New York Times reports this morning that the Catholic Bishop's Conference meeting here in Washington has just debated the question of whether action in Iran is a just war. In a debate presided over by Cardinal Law of Boston, whom the Times identified as ""the leader at the center of the abuse scandal,"" even as abuse victims are calling for his resignation. And my question, does the White House hope the bishops can achieve some real solution to their pedophile priest problem before making any proposal of pacifism towards Saddam Hussein?
 MR. McCLELLAN: You mentioned Iran. I think you meant Iraq when you said that earlier?
 Q: I mean Iraq, yes, you're right.
 MR. McCLELLAN: But the Catholic Church is working to address this issue, and it's important that they do. I think the President has expressed his concerns previously about the issue you referred to.
 Q: How does he feel about pacifism? How does he feel about --
 MR. McCLELLAN: And I think he's -- I think he's addressed it.
 Mark, let me go on to you.
 Q: Yes. Can I come back to Iraq letter?
 MR. McCLELLAN: Sure.
 Q: The first deadline that Saddam Hussein was supposed to meet was the Friday deadline for acceptance of the U.N. resolution. Has he now met it?
 MR. McCLELLAN: Again, I haven't seen the letter. I've seen the reports. I understand that the U.N. does have a copy of that letter. I don't know if we are in possession of a copy of that letter as well.
 But I would go back to what I said, we have heard this before from Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi regime. We need to see it in their actions. We need to see it in their actions to disarm. This is about disarmament, and it's going to require actions, not just words.
 Q: You haven't even seen enough of the letter to say whether it's --
 MR. McCLELLAN: I haven't seen the letter before I came out here. All the reports were happening just before I came out here.
 Dick.
 Q: I'd like to go back to David's issue for a moment, and that is deficits. What level --
 MR. McCLELLAN: David Sanger or David Gregory?
 Q: The esteemed Mr. Gregory.
 Q: Clearly mine. (Laughter.)
 MR. McCLELLAN: Esteemed? (Laughter.)
 Q: What acceptable level of deficits does the President envision? The reason I ask is that most forecasters you talk to either in New York or around town here think that we're talking about a minimum of $200 billion for most of the rest of the decade, if not all of it. And those calculations don't even take into account the possibility that we'll have some nation-building costs associated with whatever happens in Iraq. So their estimates are caveated with the expectation that, indeed, the sum is likely to go higher and perhaps far higher. And that's before --
 MR. McCLELLAN: I don't try to forecast budgets or forecast economic outlook.
 Q: But those that do think that there are some very, very hard choices to make, unless the President is willing to accept deficits north of $200 billion for the foreseeable future. How does that fit into his calculations?
 MR. McCLELLAN: I think it goes back to what I said earlier, that we need to get -- continue to keep the economy growing and take additional steps, some that the President has already outlined, some that he is going to work with Congress on to move early next year. And it goes back to the point I made, that surpluses don't create growth, growth creates surpluses. So that's the importance of getting the economy growing.
 And at the same time as we're taking additional steps to stimulate the economy, we need to show fiscal restraint. We need to fund our important prioritIes -- homeland security, the war on terrorism. And then we need to work to hold the line on spending elsewhere. There are a number of priorities within that -- David mentioned Medicare and prescription drug coverage, that's an important priority, as well.
 But if we fund our priorities and hold the line on spending elsewhere, the President believes we can get us back on that path.
 Q: If he is to achieve these things, and to fund a prescription drug benefit, realistically, where are the cuts going to have to come from? Everyone knows they're going to have to be cut. Where are they going to come from?
 MR. McCLELLAN: Well, again, I don't have the whole budget here in front of me. But, I mean, those discussions are going on now. Congress still needs to act. As you know, they've only passed two of the appropriations bills, two of the 13 appropriations bills. Congress still needs to get it done, and we are working with Congress.
 But the most important thing they need to do as they're working to get this done is to show fiscal restraint while they're funding our priorities.
 Q: Scott, coming back to homeland security bill, if I can. You've received some assurances that there will not be a filibuster, some Democrats have assured the White House that that won't take place. However, amid the revelation that the provision that would create the 9/11 commission has been stripped out of the Senate vote, there is some talk about a potential filibuster now. What is the White House going to do to try and avert that from happening, given the fact that the commission had a provision --
 MR. McCLELLAN: I understand that's not part of the legislation that is moving in the House --
 Q: Right. But it had been part of the Senate legislation and it's obviously not there now.
 MR. McCLELLAN: And the President remains committed to a strong bipartisan 9/11 commission. It's important to let them look at a broad range of issues and build upon the work that's already been completed by the intelligence committees. And he remains committed to that.
 Q: So what is the White House going to do, are you going to propose there to be --
 MR. McCLELLAN: That's an issue we're still talking with members about. As you know, there are a couple of issues that remain to be resolved and we're trying to get those issues resolved.
 Q: Does he want that done before the end of the year?
 MR. McCLELLAN: We're working with members on it. I didn't put a time line on it; it's something that's important and we continue to work with members on. We've had a number of discussions with families, as well.
 Q: Scott, the Osama bin Laden tape -- anything new to report on authenticity? And, two, could you characterize for us what the President's reaction has been to that tape?
 MR. McCLELLAN: Well, I think the President's reaction was spelled out in his remarks in the Cabinet Room. Again, the analysis is ongoing. As the President said, the experts are looking at it, they continue to look at it. There's nothing I have to confirm here right now. But obviously, as he said earlier today, any time we hear a tape like this, where someone, no matter who it is, threatens the world -- not just the United States, several countries were mentioned, individuals were mentioned, countries such as Britain, France, Italy, Jordan, Russia, Indonesia, just to name a few -- there are other countries, as well, that were threatened in that tape.
 We take that very seriously. And it is a reminder that we are at war on terrorism. It is a reminder of why we have a global coalition of some 90 countries that are working together to win that war on terrorism. We have disrupted the terrorist network, but we are continuing to hunt down the terrorists wherever they are. And we know that there are thousands of trained killers in some 60 countries, and we will not stop until we have tracked them all down, until we have stopped this threat.
 Q: Does the White House consider this a setback in the war on terrorism if it were to be found that this is, indeed, Osama bin Laden on that tape?
 MR. McCLELLAN: I think the President mentioned earlier that the war on terrorism -- that we are making tremendous progress in the war on terrorism. There is obviously more to do, but this war on terrorism is about more than any one person.
 As I just mentioned, there are some 60 countries where terrorists, thousands of trained killers, are residing. And we are going to continue the best way -- the best way to protect the American people. We are taking steps here at home by creating the Department of Homeland Security and taking other measures to protect the infrastructure and protect the American people. And that's important. But the best way to protect the American people and win this war on terrorism is to go after those killers wherever they are -- those killers who want to carry out attacks on the United States, on our friends and allies and on the international community. And we're going to continue working to hunt them down and bring them to justice or bring justice to them.
 Ken.
 Q: Let me take the last question and turn it around a bit, if I may. Did that tape in some ways make that United States's job easier, in terms of shoring up the international coalition against terrorism by tying together in a nice, pretty package the Bali bombing, the Moscow theater incident, the Yemen incident, all the countries that you mentioned, the threats against so many countries. Does that make it easier to shore up that --
 MR. McCLELLAN: It's clearly, as the President said, a reminder to the world of why we are waging this war on terrorism. It's clearly a reminder of the types of threats we face in the 21st century. That's why we're going to continue working with our coalition partners to hunt these people down wherever they are.
 Q: Does the fact that the tape mentions rather prominently the Moscow theater incident, does that -- does that lend support to President Putin's longtime assertion that Russia's war in Chechnya is part of the war on terror?
 MR. McCLELLAN: Well, as you know, we support a political solution in Chechnya and that's our position. As far as the -- what exactly is within the tape, there is analysis ongoing. But we have made our position pretty clear when it comes to Chechnya.
 Q: -- any support to make these assertions at all?
 MR. McCLELLAN: Well, again, when you were asking in the context of Chechnya, I said we support a political solution there. That's our position.
 But we are going to work with our global coalition partners to fight terrorism wherever it exists.
 Q: Will you step up efforts to find bin Laden, given the likelihood now that he has survived the Afghan war?
 MR. McCLELLAN: We have and we continue to go after the terrorist networks and their leaders, wherever they are. If there is information that comes to light, we will pursue that information. But, again, this is about more than any one man. This war on terrorism is about going after the terrorists and their networks -- they exist all across the world -- and bringing them to justice.
 Q: Scott, on the 9/11 commission again. If the White House really does want this commission, why not negotiate it as part of this bill, which is basically a White House brokered compromise? Why take it out? And especially since members of Congress seem to be --
 MR. McCLELLAN: There are still some issues that remain to be resolved --
 Q: Right, but why not negotiate --
 MR. McCLELLAN: -- with the 9/11 commission. We want -- and as the President talked about last week, the number one priority for this lame duck session is to get the Department of Homeland Security bill passed, so that we can move forward, get it up and running as soon as we possibly can.
 The 911 commission -- again, I mean, those are issues that are still being worked through, still being discussed with members, and with families of victims of well. And they're important issues. But the President supports a strong bipartisan commission.
 Q: When this bill is passed, what's your latest estimate of how long it will take to actually have a new department up and running?
 MR. McCLELLAN: Oh, I don't know that I -- I don't know that I could predict that at this point. It's going to take some time to get certain parts of it up and running. But we want to move as quickly as possible to begin that process. That's why they need to go and act now, get this to the President's bill [sic], so we can start moving on it quickly and get it up and running.
 Q: You have no estimate -- a year?
 MR. McCLELLAN: Well, some parts of it may take time. But we will move as quickly as we can to begin that process. We already are making preparations, if that department is passed by the Congress.
 Q: Scott, you said earlier that Secretary Mineta was going to brief at the meeting, Cabinet meeting today about the TSA. Is it the administration's feeling that the deadlines for bomb detection equipment and the other airport precautions are going to be met by the end of the year? Is there any consideration of an extension?
 MR. McCLELLAN: I think Secretary Mineta addressed it, not only in the news reports that were in today's papers, but he addressed it in the Cabinet meeting as well. He said that we're committed to meeting the congressional deadline. So I understand there is some discussion going on that in Congress, but he made it clear that -- and we've made a tremendous amount of progress. But we are committing to meeting the congressional deadline.
 Q: Scott, I know you have, and appreciate the fact that you haven't read the letter, but separate and apart from that, based on the President's own public statements over the last couple of months, is it the President's position that Iraq does in fact have chemical and biological weapons, and is pursuing nuclear weapons?
 MR. McCLELLAN: That's a good question. We have made that clear, that Iraq does possess chemical and biological weapons. And what we are doing is to -- what we are working to do right now with the international community, speaking with one voice, is to disarm Saddam Hussein of those weapons of mass destruction. We know that he possesses chemical and biological weapons. And we know that he seeks to acquire nuclear weapons.
 Q: And that said, what sort of a foundation for cooperation is laid by a statement that these weapons don't exist?
 MR. McCLELLAN: Well, again, you're asking me to comment about a letter that I have not seen. The resolution, I go back to that, says they have a 30-day time period to disclose all information. So that's what I would refer you back to.
 Q: On Israel and terrorism, will the United States aid Israel in any way in its investigation of this horrendous murder in the kibbutz of the women and her two children, because of this eerie coincidence or relationship, the fact that the killer was Sirhan Sirhan, the cousin of the Sirhan Sirhan who is in American custody?
 MR. McCLELLAN: I don't have any information on that, Connie. I might refer you to the State Department. What specific --
 Q: Well, since Sirhan Sirhan who killed Kennedy is in American custody, and the 19 year old who killed the woman and the two children is also named Sirhan Sirhan and is a cousin. I'm just wondering if there is any possibility of a relationship with it?
 MR. McCLELLAN: I just don't have any information on this.
 Let me get April.
 Q: Scott, on another issue from the news conference last week, President Bush talked about Pickering and Owens in the Senate committee, Judiciary Committee. What is the work right now that's happening on that process with them to make it through and to actually --
 MR. McCLELLAN: I'm glad you brought that up. I understand Congress is moving on a couple of the nominations. The President has made it very clear that the voice of the entire Senate deserves to be heard on his nominees. There are far too many vacancies in the judiciary and far too many very qualified individuals who have been held up, their nominations have been held up. And that's why the President said the voice of the entire Senate needs to be heard. There are currently 18 pending court of appeals nominees being held up, almost all of whom have received very strong bipartisan support. So we urge Congress to -- urge the Senate to allow those nominees to be voted on, on the floor.
 Q: You're vocally urging from the podium, but what has the President done since the news conference in talking about what could be done for these nominees?
 MR. McCLELLAN: I think the White House staff continues to work with Congress to move these nominees forward. We work very closely with them on an individual basis. I would also point out -- I would also point out on nominations that there are over -- this is beyond just judicial nominees -- there are over 95 nominations awaiting floor action, and over 150 nominations awaiting committee and floor action. And it's important that Congress move forward on those nominees, as well, so that we have people in place to carry out their responsibilities.
 Thank you.

George W. Bush,"November 15, 2002",Press Briefing by Dr. Rice on the President's Trip to the NATO Summit,"James S. Brady Press Briefing Room
10:30 A.M. EST
DR. RICE: I'm going to open with a brief overview of the President's upcoming trip to Europe for the NATO summit and for other meetings, and then I'll be happy to take your questions.
There are three major items on the agenda at the NATO summit in Prague. First, NATO will, for the second time since the end of the Cold War, welcome new members. This is an historic event for Europe and for the Transatlantic Alliance, as Europe continues to move closer to realizing the vision of a continent that is whole, free, and at peace.
President Bush has long maintained America's commitment to a strong NATO alliance and to a robust expansion of NATO, a point that he made dramatically in his speech at Warsaw when he said that the Alliance should do as much as possible, not as little. And I think you will see that at the NATO summit that charge has been taken up.
Second, NATO members will work to advance the task of transforming NATO. The end of the Cold War has meant the end of the Cold War threat of massive armies contending for the Central European plains. And all NATO members today face common threats from terrorists and the states that sponsor them. These threats require a different kind of military force to defend against, a force that is lighter, more agile, and more flexible. NATO members are working to transform their forces to meet new threats and to increase the ability of our forces to work together.
Third, we will make further progress in building a new relationship with Russia. This summit and this round of expansion will be further evidence of America's and Europe's new strategic relationship with Russia, which is formalized in agreements such as the Moscow Treaty and the NATO-Russia Council. An alliance founded to wage the Cold War will once again show how far it has come since that task was completed.
The President and Mrs. Bush will depart Washington on Tuesday morning, arriving in Prague that evening. On Wednesday, the President will hold five bilateral meetings with Czech President Havel, Czech Prime Minister Spidla, with President Sezer of Turkey, President Chirac of France, and NATO Secretary General Lord Robertson. At each of the meetings the President will discuss NATO issues, Iraq, the war on terrorism, and bilateral matters.
Later that afternoon, the President will deliver remarks at the Prague Atlantic Students Summit, where he will discuss his vision of a Europe whole, free and at peace.
On Thursday, the President will attend several working sessions of the NATO summit, and an announcement of the countries to be invited into NATO will be made on Thursday.
On Friday, the President travels to St. Petersburg, Russia, where he will meet with President Putin. The two Presidents will discuss a host of issues, including Russia's emerging relationship with NATO.
President Bush will leave Russia for Vilnius, Lithuania on Friday evening. And on Saturday, the President will hold a bilateral meeting with the President of Lithuania, as well as a joint meeting with the Presidents of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
The President will then travel to Bucharest, Romania, where he will meet with Romanian President Iliescu, and make remarks to the Romanian people at a square in central Bucharest. President and Mrs. Bush will return to Washington on Saturday evening.
And now I'm happy to take your questions. Ron.
Q As the President prepares to head overseas, Americans are being warned again about potential threats at this time by the FBI, saying that al Qaeda is planing a spectacular attack that could involve massive casualties. Just for the record, what could Americans do about this, and is there any intelligence pointing to a specific time, place or method?
DR. RICE: The warnings that have gone out recently really are a summary of intelligence, not a new warning. This is a summary of intelligence as we know it.
It is important that Americans know when this sort of thing comes to the attention of the administration. We would ask Americans to do what the President has asked them a number of times to do, which is remain vigilant, because the American people are, in many ways, the first line of defense. There have been many cases in which Americans who were alert to suspicious circumstances around them have been able to tip law enforcement officials.
I will say that a lot is being done to bring additional protective measures, particularly to critical infrastructure locations around the United States. There is a very active now program of coordination on this particular period of time with both public and private entities, and at the federal, state and local areas -- local levels. And we are raising protective measures in a number of placed around the country. But there are not specifics, Ron, as to time, date or, for that matter, very much about how this might carry out. So we think this is what we need to do at this point.
Q Dr. Rice, because of these warnings, critics have suggested that the administration is focused too much on the war, or possibility of war against Iraq, and not enough on the terrorism threat at home. And ordinary citizens continue to ask, why go after Iraq now if we have this unfinished problem right here at home?
DR. RICE: Well, let me start by saying that the President begins his day at 8:00 a.m. in the morning with the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, joined shortly after that by my colleague Tom Ridge, and the FBI Director, and his counterterrorism person to review the counter -- the terrorism threats to the United States. He does not begin his day on Iraq. He begins his day on the war on terrorism and the threat levels, and the threat information that we have about the United States. This is a central focus of this administration.
And the war on terrorism, as the President said back on September 20th when he addressed the Congress, is being fought on many fronts. It is a war that is many times being fought in the shadows, so that it's not always on television screens. Yes, it is different than the early phases of the war when we were in a large-scale military operation in Afghanistan. But we should focus our attention also on how much disruption of al Qaeda there has been.
There have been a number of -- numerous senior leaders of al Qaeda that have either been eliminated, incarcerated, or detained someplace. One of the reasons that we have different sources of information that we did not have is that we have some of those people in custody who are informing us about how al Qaeda operates, about what various things might mean. This is a war on terrorism that is going to be ongoing for a long time, but that is being fought very aggressively and will continue to be fought very aggressively.
That said, it is also the case that the worst nightmare that we would face is the combination of extremism with a hostile regime armed with weapons of mass destruction. And the President has made very clear that he believes the Iraqi regime is a regime that, both through its efforts to acquire weapons of mass destruction and its long-known support for terrorism, is a potential threat for exactly that nexus. And so Iraq is a part of the war on terrorism. But the part of the war on terrorism that is going after al Qaeda and disrupting and trying to protect the country is fought aggressively every day, every hour by this administration and that's how the President begins his day.
Q Dr. Rice, are you looking for a statement of support from the NATO meeting on Iraq? And are you looking for a military commitment? If not, why not?
DR. RICE: This is a summit that is going to celebrate an historic moment for NATO, which is the expansion of NATO into territories that I think nobody ever thought NATO would expand into. And that is really the central purpose of this summit. It is also the central purpose of this summit to talk about how to improve NATO's capabilities to deal with the threats that we face today.
Now, of course, we expect that Iraq will be discussed and, of course, the President will discuss Iraq in bilaterals and probably in the NATO Council, as well. But there is a lot of work that has already gone on and is already going on in terms of coalition building for Iraq. We now have a U.N. Security Council resolution that is 15 to 0, so it's not just NATO that is united about what to do about Saddam Hussein, it's the entire world that is united.
I suspect that we will hear from NATO partners what they are prepared to do and what they can do, but that's not the purpose of this summit. The purpose of this summit is to invite new members in, to celebrate NATO's future, and to talk about how far NATO has come and how it remains a vital and viable alliance some 11 years after the end of the Cold War.
Q So you're not expecting some sort of statement of support?
DR. RICE: Well, there will undoubtedly be discussion of this and there probably will be statements about it. But that's not the central purpose of this meeting. But I assume that there will be some kind of statement from NATO about this.
Q Dr. Rice, why is it necessary for the United States Air Force to control the airspace above Prague, to secure Prague during the summit? What does that say about the capabilities gap within NATO? And in what way will that gap be addressed at this summit?
DR. RICE: Let's remember that the United States is, of course, a member of NATO. And so whatever assets the United States can lend to protection of NATO during the NATO summit, it's perfectly appropriate for the United States to do that. One of the things that we will discuss at the summit is how to think about getting new capabilities for NATO members. You will have very -- a lot of small members of NATO, for instance, for the first time. And they cannot -- across the entire range of military capabilities -- contribute. But they can contribute in specific ways, in niche ways to the overall military capability of NATO. So that will be discussed.
The truth of the matter is that everybody is having to reassess capabilities at this time. Everybody is having to make a transformation. This isn't just something that NATO and the Europeans are having to do. The United States, itself, is having to make a transformation and having to assess capabilities. And I think you will see that this is an issue that the NATO Alliance takes seriously, that member states take seriously, and that we will make some progress on exactly this.
Q -- the question of financial commitment?
DR. RICE: Some of it is certainly a question of financial commitment. But it's also a question of getting the mission right and determining what capabilities you really need.
Q Dr. Rice, what can you say about what you and your colleagues have learned about how al Qaeda is operating now? And if the presumption is that Osama bin Laden is still alive, is he playing the same role that he's played in the past as sort of the brains and the person who sets into motion any plots?
DR. RICE: David, I don't think that we can be certain of what role Osama bin Laden is or is not playing. What we have to assume is that whatever al Qaeda is doing in terms of command and control has to be different than what it was doing before because they don't have the home base in Afghanistan. And that is a good thing.
We, obviously, also are working harder in an international fashion to disrupt their activities than we were prior to 9/11. We just simply have a much more -- a much larger umbrella of intelligence and law enforcement, a much more coordinated effort of law enforcement and intelligence than the world has seen ever on any target. And so that is another factor in disrupting and making it hard to operate. But, of course, it is adaptable. It's an adaptable organization. We have to assume that it's trying to adapt.
Our goal has to be to, every day with our partners around the world, take as much information as we possibly can, assess it and try to respond to it. And that is what we do on a daily basis. The al Qaeda operations in Afghanistan were destroyed. Another piece of this is to make sure that there are not other places that they can puddle, or other places that they can gain the kind of foothold that they did in Afghanistan. And that's why you see us working with countries like Yemen or with Philippines or Indonesia to try and keep that from happening.
Q Can I just follow on one point? Assuming that people you have in custody may provide some sort of guidance on plots that may have been discussed at some point in the past, isn't it difficult because the organization seems to become more decentralized now, to fight it? Are you working on the assumption that where it can puddle together, then plots that were discussed before might ultimately come to fruition?
DR. RICE: Well, David, without getting into too great a detail here, what you have to do is to recognize that there are going to be adaptations that they will make and there are adaptations that we will make, and that we do have the advantage of having in custody people who can talk about the operation, who can talk about how various people were involved in various operations. That's all very helpful to all of us.
But in many places in the world, law enforcement and intelligence are working together in ways that they have not in the past. And I would just emphasize to you the importance of having this as a kind of worldwide activity, not just one that the United States is loosely engaged in.
Q Dr. Rice, some of us had been told by people here that the President would actually make a speech on Iraq during this meeting, and that it would probably be the Wednesday speech. Has that now been changed? Do you expect --
DR. RICE: The Wednesday speech? In Prague?
Q Yes.
DR. RICE: The President is going to talk about NATO in Prague, and about Europe's future.
Q He's not going to make a pitch -- about Iraq?
DR. RICE: The President will have an opportunity, when he's with his colleagues, to talk about a number of challenges, one of which is Iraq. But the plan for the President's major address is to talk about the future of Europe.
Q Could you just talk about what you expect -- what course you expect conversations with Putin to take and what role you think Chechnya will play in those conversations, where -- what the President wants?
DR. RICE: Let me just -- going back to the point about Iraq, let me put it in context. Iraq is typical or the most important example of the kind of threat that NATO will face in the future. So it would be odd if this were not an issue at the summit. But it is not the reason for this summit.
In terms of the discussions with President Putin, I think you will -- obviously, we expect to discuss Chechnya in the following way -- recognizing that terrorism can never be a legitimate method for any cause. And the President has said that to President Putin. He said it to him when the Moscow events took place.
We still believe that the best way to resolve this situation is through a political solution that can take care of legitimate aspirations of the Chechen people, recognizing that Chechnya is a part of Russia, but recognizing that this is a part of Russia in which there are ethnic groups that have particular aspirations and cultural ties. And so I think they will talk about that during their meetings. I would be surprised if they did not.
Yes, a follow-up?
Q A follow-up. You once suggested that the difference about the situation in Chechnya is that because this underlying political problem, where you don't have that underlying political problem with al Qaeda or with other terrorist groups. First off, President Putin does not agree with that. He says -- he reminds that -- did pose political demands. But even in a broader sense, in Afghanistan, you used force for a political change of regime. In Iraq you are using blunt force for a political change in regime. So why the double standard?
DR. RICE: There's not a double standard here. Terrorism is wrong, wherever it is. Whether it is practiced in Chechnya or in the streets of Moscow or in New York or in Berlin, terrorism is wrong. And the President has been clearer about that than anyone. He's also been clear in trying to help, for instance, the Georgians to deal with terrorist elements in their country that could be contributing to this problem.
That said, political circumstances need to be dealt with, and I believe President Putin himself has said from time to time that, of course, Moscow would like to find a political solution to the Chechen circumstances. And so it is a particular history, it's different than a lot of other histories, but it does need a political solution. That does not excuse the fact that terrorism cannot be used in any cause.
MR. MCCORMACK: Let's make this the last question.
Q Could we make the last two? I have a couple. (Laughter.) First of all, what can you point to to show the American people success in the war against terrorism, given constant warnings of threat and warnings by very senior administration officials that we could face an attack with casualties of a scale much larger than we saw on September 11th?
And, second, how can you show the American people that the threat -- the description of Iraq as part of the war against terrorism is not a simple convenience, given that the war against terrorism is politically popular, and it is very difficult for people to see a connection between Saddam Hussein and al Qaeda that even senior intelligence officials question?
DR. RICE: We know one thing about bad guys -- they tend to travel in packs. They do tend to help each other, they do tend to coalesce around issues. Saddam Hussein has a long terrorist past. Whether it is in support of Palestinian rejectionists or the Abu Nidal organization, or helping some al Qaeda operatives gain training in CBRN, or having meetings with -- between Iraqis and al Qaeda in various parts of the world, there's a relationship here.
Nobody has said that he has operational control of al Qaeda or that he caused September 11th, that's not the point. But the point is, if you look at a regime like Iraq, with a growing -- growing capabilities in terms of weapons of mass destruction and with an extreme animus toward the United States, and you look at the potential for that to link up with terrorist organizations, including with al Qaeda, you have to be concerned about that. And it is important to take account of what the Iraqi regime is doing and to deal with it, both because of that, and because you do not want Saddam Hussein, who is a homicidal dictator, armed with a nuclear weapon in the Middle East, which is the most volatile region of the world.
So the President has been very clear about his reasons for insisting on action toward Saddam Hussein. Terrorism is a piece of it, but so is the ambition and behavior of Saddam Hussein, because sooner or later the ambitions of Saddam Hussein and the interests of the United States are going to clash. And let's remember that this is somebody who isn't a status quo power; he is active in his policy.
In terms of the first question, I would just remind the American people that it took a while for al Qaeda to become the organization that it is; it took a while for them to lodge themselves in 60 countries around the world, including the United States; it took a while for them to become an effective organization. It's going to take a while to break them up.
We have a lot going for us and we've mobilized a great deal. You have now what you have never had before, which is the attention of intelligence and law enforcement organizations all over the world on these extremist activities of organizations like al Qaeda and their brethren. You have constant coordination and reporting and integration of everything that -- of what is know worldwide about them and activities to disrupt them. We didn't have that prior to September 11th; we have that in place now.
We have locked up or detained or eliminated important al Qaeda leaders. We have eliminated their base in Afghanistan so they cannot operate in the way that they have in the past. We have strengthened the resolve and the capacity of countries like Yemen and the Philippines and countries in Africa to deal with this threat. A lot has been done.
But I would also remind people that on September 20th, the President told everyone that this was going to be a long struggle, not a short one, that a lot of the victories would be won in the shadows. And victories are won every day. When a cell is disrupted in Buffalo, or when something is broken up in Singapore, or broken up in Germany, those are victories in the war on terrorism.
But the President has been very clear that he is going to lead this country in a way that shows perseverance and tirelessness and resolve, which is what you have to do when you're dealing with an organization that has been around for a while and that has managed to penetrate into a lot of places -- going to take time.
Q One NATO question?
DR. RICE: Yes, a NATO question. (Laughter.) There's a concept. Yes, sure.
Q If the U.S.-German relationship is central to NATO, as many people believe, what plans are there, if any, for the President and Mr. Schroeder to meet and talk?
DR. RICE: I'm sure they will see each other at NATO. As you know, they talked by phone about a week ago. Look, the relationship with Germany is very important and it will work and continue to work to the benefit of both countries. The Germans are preparing to try to become the next lead nation in the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan. That's extremely important. And so we are working with the Germans and will continue to.
We have very good counterterrorism cooperation, for instance, with the Germans -- that every day is important to our efforts to disrupt al Qaeda and to disrupt organizations around the world. So, yes, it's an important relationship, and it's going to continue to work. And I'm sure that the Chancellor and the President will see each other at the summit, though they won't -- there's no formal meeting planned.
Q But why is there no scheduled bilateral meeting with the two?
DR. RICE: There are scheduled bilaterals with very few people at the NATO summit, and --
Q If Germany is so important?
DR. RICE: There are a lot of very important countries with which we're not having bilaterals at the NATO summit.
Q Yes, and on Germany, can I ask your assessment -- Germany has, in its recent elections, essentially taken it out of any participation in any military action in Iraq, even one sanctioned under Chapter 7 by the United Nations. What is your assessment of what that does to Germany's credibility in a defensive alliance, military alliance like NATO, when it won't assume its responsibilities, even under the U.N. Charter and Chapter 7?
DR. RICE: Well, this is for Germans to decide and for the German government to decide, what role Germany can play. I would note that this is a U.N. Security Council resolution that has the backing of everybody in the world, including Syria. And I'm quite certain that the members of NATO, all of them, are supportive of trying to work to make sure that the U.N. Security Council resolution is carried out.
But let's be realistic; the Germans have done a lot in Afghanistan, in the war on terrorism there, in counterterrorism. We appreciate that very much. As I said, they're preparing to take leadership of the ISAF. That's going to be a tremendous contribution. But Germany will have to decide what role it can and cannot play to enforce U.N. Security Council resolutions if that's necessary.
Thank you very much.

George W. Bush,"November 18, 2002",Interview With Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty,"Coalition Against Iraq
Q. Mr. President, this week NATO will be celebrating an historic expansion as well as focusing on transforming the Alliance to meet new threats, such as Iraq. You have spoken about the possibility of leading a coalition of the willing against Iraq. Why not speak about using NATO forces against Iraq, since under NATO's charter all members are supposed to come to the aid of any member under direct threat?
The President. Well, first of all, I hope we can do this peacefully. And by doing it peacefully, that means I hope Saddam Hussein disarms. Of course, we've hoped that for 11 years. We've hoped that for 16 resolutions. We now have a 17th resolution, and this time I intend to work with nations that love freedom and peace, make sure the resolution stands. And if he doesn't disarm, you're right, I'll lead a coalition of the willing to disarm him. And there's all kinds of ways for that coalition to be formed. It could be formed with NATO, if they choose. I have said to the U.N. Security Council, ""We'll go back and discuss the matter with you."" But Mr. Saddam Hussein must understand he'll be disarmed one way or the other. I hope it's done peacefully.
NATO and the War on Terror
Q. The new members of NATO are quite small. Do you see them as contributing something significant militarily to the Alliance?
The President. I was hoping you'd ask, do I see them contributing something to the Alliance, so I'm going to answer it that way. First, I'll answer it militarily, because I do believe they can contribute something really important, and that is, they can contribute their love for freedom. These are countries which have lived in totalitarian states. They haven't been free. And now they've seen freedom and they love freedom, just like America loves freedom. And that's going to be a really important—it will add some vigor to the relationship in NATO that's healthy and wholesome.
And I think they will. The key is to— I think they will help militarily—but the key is to change the military strategy of NATO. Lord Robertson understands this. It starts with the understanding that Russia is not our enemy. NATO doesn't need to be constructed to prevent the Warsaw Pact from invading Europe. After all, the Warsaw Pact doesn't exist. As a matter of fact, the Warsaw Pact is becoming NATO, slowly but surely. We don't need that type of mentality, and we've got to have a military strategy that addresses the true threats.
The threats we face are global terrorist attacks. That's the threat. And the more you love freedom, the more likely it is you'll be attacked. And therefore, the Article 5 that you referred to for NATO becomes very relevant in this war against terror. The war against terror will not only be defeated—the terrorists will not only be defeated militarily, but the terrorists will be defeated as we share intelligence and as we cut off money and as we deny access and as we stiffen up border requirements in order to make sure that people can't go from one spot to another with plots and/or messages to attack.
And so it's a different kind of war. And it's going to be an interesting meeting, because not only is the meeting going to expand, but the meeting is going to address how best to achieve this common objective. I'm absolutely convinced that the so-called military gap between America and all countries can be addressed with a good strategy. And that will be interesting for observers to watch. I think it's going to happen. I know that Lord Robertson, who runs NATO, is committed to developing a relevant strategy and one that will work.
Chechnya/War on Terror
Q. Russian President Vladimir Putin has equated his war in Chechnya with the U.S. war on terrorism. Do you agree with that equation, or do you still feel, as was stated during your election campaign, that Russian forces are committing brutalities against innocent Chechen civilians?
The President. I think that Russia should be able to—or hope that Russia should be able to solve their issue with Chechnya peacefully. That's not to say that Vladimir shouldn't do what it takes to protect his people from individual terrorist attacks. But this is a different kind of war that we face. This is a war where we're dealing with people who hide in caves and kind of shadowy corners of the world and send people to their suicidal deaths. It's a war that I believe can lend itself both to chasing those people down and, at the same time, solving issues in a peaceful way, with respect for the human rights of minorities within countries. I said that in the campaign. I also say it to Mr. Putin every time I see him.
NATO-Russia Partnership
Q. Do you envision Russia ever becoming a full-fledged member of NATO?
The President. I think the partnership between NATO and Russia is going to be a very constructive partnership. We'll see. Time will tell. The key thing is to make sure the relationship works the way it should, which really says to Russia that a expanded NATO on your border is not a threat to you or your future. As a matter of fact, it should enable you to grow peacefully.
I'm going from Prague to St. Petersburg precisely to deliver that message to the Russian people, that even though NATO will have been expanded on your border, particularly in sensitive areas like the Baltics, you should not fear expansion, you should welcome expansion, because you've now got a neighborhood that is much more peaceful for you to—in which to realize your vast potential. And that's important for Russia to hear.
Q. Russia now has a special council with NATO——
The President. Are we getting the hook already?
Q. Does that mean we're running out of time? Let me ask you another question——
The President. It's hard to see on radio.
Freedom and the War on Terror
Q. Central Asia—we broadcast to Central Asia. And many experts say that the authoritarian regimes in that region are actually fueling terrorism because their people feel helpless and unable to effect change. Do you think there are any dangers in the U.S. allying itself closely with those governments that are——
The President. I think anytime the United States allies itself with a government, that we never forget the basic premises of our existence, and that is: Freedom is important; the human condition for all are important; we value every life; everybody counts. And in my judgment, the more people relate to the United States and work with the United States, the more likely it is they will work to improve the human condition. And that's what we spend a lot of time doing. That's one of the great things about our country is that we embrace freedom, first and foremost.
It's one of my concerns about Iraq. Listen, we've got people living in Iraq that are tortured and brutalized in order to keep this man in power. I weep for those who suffer.
And so the great cause of the United States is freedom. I tell these countries— they talk about freedom—I say, ""Freedom isn't America's gift to the world. It's God-given. Everybody counts."" And it is with— that spirit of recognizing the values of freedom I think will help improve people, no matter where. And you're right, there's some leaders there that need work with, and we're prepared to work with them.
But I will tell you, people—poverty is a tool for recruitment amongst these global terrorists. It's a way for them to recruit, perhaps. But poverty doesn't cause killers to exist. And it's an important distinction to make. These global terrorists are—some of them are rich, monetarily. They're obviously poor in spirit. They have no regard for human life. They claim they're religious, and they kill in the name of religion. And there are some breeding grounds, no question about it. And therefore, we hope that prosperity spreads out from central government to help people. But I hope people don't confuse the mentality of the terrorist leaders and economic plight, because these people are plenty comfortable. They just kill. And we're going to get them before they get us. And that's what the world needs to know about the United States.
Usama bin Laden
Q. Usama bin Laden still seems to be alive. Are you——
The President. Could be.
Q. ——worried that he's plotting another major attack on the United States?
The President. Whether it's him or somebody else, they're plotting an attack, no question about it. That's why we've got to get them. But this issue is bigger than one person. If—the war on terror is a group of fanatics. They hate America because of what we stand for. They hate us because we love freedom. And that's why we're on the hunt. And slowly but surely, we're dismantling them.
I told the people of this country it's going to take a while. I said it's going to be patient—the farther we get away from September the 11th, 2001, the more people are going to tend to forget what took place in this country. And it's normal reaction for people to just kind of try to settle back and hope that something doesn't exist. But my job is to remind people of the threats we face, based upon facts, and to find these killers. And that's exactly what we're going to do. As I tell people in America, there's no cave dark enough to hide from the justice of America and our friends.
And my speech I'm going to give in Prague to the youngsters there, I'm going to remind them there is a coalition of the willing in place right now, chasing down terror. We've got 90 nations—90 different nations—all teamed up, doing everything we can to bring these people to justice. And we'll prevail. Make no mistake about it. We'll prevail.
Thank you, sir.
Q. Thank you, sir.
The President. Is there any doubt in your mind we'll prevail?
Q. Not anymore. [Laughter]",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-radio-free-europeradio-liberty
George W. Bush,"November 18, 2002",Interview With LNK TV of Lithuania,"President's Upcoming Visit to Lithuania
Q. Mr. President, you are the first President of the United States to visit Lithuania. What is your message to Lithuania's people?
The President. Well, first, I'm honored to be invited. Secondly, I'm really looking forward to it. And my message is: You're free. Freedom is precious, and we welcome our friends the Lithuanians into the—as a free nation into the brotherhood of nations.
I'll also say to the world that the Baltic countries know what it means to live under fear and the lack of freedom, and to have these countries be allied with the United States and other nations is important to our soul. It's important to have that sense of freedom as a source of vigor and strength, and a very important alliance. That's what I want to say.
War on Terror
Q. What are America and Lithuania going to do after the Prague, together?
The President. Well, we're going to work to fight terror. That's the new threat we face. It's most evident here in America because we've been under attack, and we're still under attack. People still want to hurt us because of what we stand for. But countries which love freedom are not immune from these people. These are coldblooded killers, and we've got a charge to keep for a long time coming. And the best way to do that is work together.
So the NATO mission is one of defending freedom by fighting against those who would try to defeat freedom, which means we've got to share intelligence, work together militarily in a way that complements everybody, cut off the money of the terrorists. I mean, there's a lot to do. But that's the true threat that we face.
Russia is no longer a threat. After Prague, I'm going to Russia. And I'm going to say to the Russian people, ""You shouldn't fear expansion of NATO to your border. These are peace-loving people. These are freedom-loving people that are now on your border. You ought to welcome them. It should help Russian security""— that the cold war is over, that the United States doesn't view Russia as a threat and neither does NATO. So we've got to address our sights to the new threats.
Russia-U.S. Relations
Q. Relationship between Western democracies and Russia seems to be very friendly. But do you really trust President Putin?
The President. Sure, of course. I press any leader that doesn't believe 100 percent in freedom, and of course I do—I'm—freedom of the press or Chechnya or issues that indicate that there might not be a whole-hearted commitment to freedom of the people. I do it in a way that's a friendly way. I believe the best way to work together is to do it in a spirit of cooperation. I believe the best way to make sure we've got good relations is to make it clear that there's no animosity. But of course I do. I work very closely with him. Russia is an important country.
And we want Russia to be a country based upon the values which we share, because we believe those values are the best values for the human condition of everybody. I like to tell people, freedom is not an American gift; freedom is a gift from the almighty God. And I firmly believe that. And freedom is important in any country in the world.
Lithuania
Q. Some people wonder why the United States, the superpower of the world, pays so much attention to the small Baltic state Lithuania. What could you tell those people?
The President. Well, I can tell those people everybody matters. See, our country believes in the worth of every individual. We believe everybody is precious; everybody counts; and that we are rooted, our whole history and our very being is rooted, on the notion of people being able to realize their dreams. And that's what we believe.
That's why we never recognized the Soviet domination of the Baltics. We called Lithuania independent for all those years. And now we can say, Lithuania is independent, and Lithuania is forever free. And that's our commitment.
Future of NATO
Q. How do you imagine the future of NATO Alliance after new members will join?
The President. Better—better because the—NATO will have this new spirit. Listen, if you lived under slavery and subjugation and you're free, there's a spirit. There's a strength of purpose. There's a remembrance of what it's like. There's no gray areas between good and evil. That's an important spirit in NATO. Lithuania brings a wonderful spirit of strength of purpose, of endurance.
Secondly, as we change the military strategy to reflect the new threat—see, Russia is not a threat militarily. The threats that we now face come from a global terror network. And we'll change our military capabilities to meet the strategies necessary to defeat terrorism. And Lithuania will have an important contribution to make, as will all countries in NATO. So the expansion of NATO will make it easier for us to defend the peace.
Q. Mr. President, thank you very much, indeed. It was a great pleasure to talk to you.
President's Upcoming Visit to Lithuania
The President. We'll see you in Vilnius.
Q. Thank you.
The President. It's going to be exciting for me.
Q. For us, too. We're waiting for that.
The President. I can't wait. Thanks. Make sure the weather is good, will you? [Laughter]
Q. Yes, we'll do our best. Thank you.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-lnk-tv-lithuania
George W. Bush,"November 18, 2002",Interview With European Journalists,"The President. So here's what we're going to do. I'll say a few comments, and we'll kind of do the loop until we run out of time.
First, I'm really looking forward to this trip. I think it's going to be historic. You'll ask me who I'm voting for, for expansion; I'm not going to tell you. You'll find out on Thursday. I say that because that's what we've all agreed to.
But if you're interested in knowing my philosophy toward the Prague summit, then you need only look as far as the speech I gave in Warsaw, Poland, that talked about a Europe whole, free, and at peace. I believe NATO expansion—and in that speech, you'd see that I talked about NATO expansion as good for America, because a Europe whole, free, and at peace is good for America.
I am—believe in the spirit of the countries that we're talking about. I believe in their spirit. These are countries that have lived under totalitarianism, and they understand the value of freedom. And they love freedom, and I love that spirit. I think that's going to be a very important part of invigorating the Alliance.
The Alliance is a crucial alliance. It's a strong alliance. We're going into a new period. And the idea of having members that are willing to shoulder their share of the burden of keeping the peace with the new threats is good, but—and this spirit of understanding what totalitarianism can mean and understanding the responsibilities of being free nations—that come with being a free nation is very important at this summit.
So I'm really looking forward to it. It's— I'm excited to go to countries that have invited me to come. I look forward to the events. And so, with that, I'll answer some questions. Why don't we start here? You are from?
President's Upcoming Visit to Romania
Q. Yes, sir. I am from Romania.
The President. That's good.
Q. Sir, the Romanian people waited for the Americans after the World War II. We've waited for you almost 60 years. You know, the farmers were raising the corn in such a way that the American planes could land. That happened in '45 and the fifties. Now, for my parents, it might be a little bit late, but for my 11-years daughter, it might have a chance. You're coming to Bucharest next Saturday. This time are the Americans really coming to Romania?
The President. Great question. No more Munichs. No more Yaltas. America—I come to your country because I believe that Romania is an important part of a Europe which is whole and free and at peace. The story of Romania is a powerful story, of people taking charge of their own lives, of——
[At this point, a tape recorder stopped.]
The President. We had a click here, in case anybody is interested. This one right here. Poor planning? [Laughter] Nobody claims it? Shouldn't have said poor planning. This is nobody's?
Q. Might be mine.
The President. It's yours?
Q. Yes. If it's out, it's out. That's okay. [Laughter]
The President. You don't want—if you've got to, turn it over. Getting quite articulate there. [Laughter]
A lot of us watched the story of your country ridding yourselves of a totalitarian dictator, and it was a powerful story. But the story didn't end there. The story ended with a desire for freedom and democracy and open markets.
And the answer to your question is, absolutely. That's what the whole Prague summit is about: All for one, and one for all. We remember here in our country when, after the attacks of September the 11th, NATO stood up and said, ""An attack on the United States is an attack on us."" I will say the same thing about Romania and Lithuania and the Czech Republic and anybody else that might be a member of NATO. And that's what I feel.
I appreciate that question. That's—your question is one of the reasons I look so forward to going to Romania——
Q. Thank you, sir.
The President. ——to be able to provide that assurance in what is going to be a, as I understand it, magnificent event where, on the one hand, I will be able to point to statues of heroic liberators, people who believed in freedom, that freedom was ingrained in their soul, and on the other hand, point to a balcony where the dictator had his—he realized reality. It's— as a matter of fact, I was looking at my speech last night.
End of the Cold War
Q. I'm from Lithuania, and Lithuania was recognized 11 years ago by your father, President Bush——
The President. Forty-one, we call him.
Q. ——who took an active role in managing the collapse of the Soviet Union. How do you recall these times?
The President. Yes. Well, first, I want— I remember that, in terms of the Baltic states, that our country always viewed the Baltics as independent. During the Soviet era, we viewed the Baltics as independent. Secondly, I recall the times leading up to the collapse of the Soviet leadership, not only with my dad's actions as President but those of Ronald Reagan as well, where there was clarity of thought, that there was no equivocation when it came to issues such as freedom.
And I keep saying that word because it is an issue that we face collectively today in other parts of the world. Freedom is essentially a human condition. It's not an American gift. It is God's gift to the world. I believe that. I believe that everybody— the Almighty recognizes, through His mercy and grace, that people are—the freedom of each individual. Everybody counts. Everybody is precious.
It was exciting times for Americans to watch the change in the Soviet Union, because it meant that the days of significant animosity could be ending. A lot of us grew up when the two big countries were fierce enemies, and the rest of the world watched to see whether or not there would be war and watched many times in horror as to whether or not there would be war, because the consequences of war between the Soviet Union and America would have been devastating for a lot of people. It looked like that, to us, that the collapse of the Soviet Union would provide an opportunity for peace. That's the most significant— that's the most exciting thing for me, that the relationship would be changed.
I'm honored to be in a position to help further the change of the relationship. I'll answer the Russian journalist's question in a minute—I'm not going to anticipate it— but I am going, after Prague, immediately to Russia for a reason.
And anyway, it was exciting times for us. But the exciting—the true excitement is going to come when the people of the Baltics realize the world has changed dramatically, and it finally has changed dramatically in many ways, that Russia is not an enemy, that the United States is not an enemy of Russia, that the United States is still a friend of the Baltics. But most importantly, the Baltic people have got an opportunity now to realize their full potential. And that was what was 11 years ago we first saw, and it's an honor to be a continuing part of that history.
Yes, sir.
Chechnya/War on Terror
Q. Mr. President, I would like to ask you a question regarding Chechnya.
The President. Sure.
Q. I guess it will be one of the topics you will discuss with Mr. Putin——
The President. Absolutely.
Q. Do you believe that after the latest events—mainly, after hostage in Moscow and after the statements made by Usama bin Laden raising the terrorist acts in Bali and Moscow, do you believe, Mr. President, that you can understand better this red—terrorists pose to Russia? And would you agree—would you agree with President Putin, who says that the Chechen kind of terrorism vis-a-vis Russia is of the same nature as the Al Qaida terrorism to the United States?
The President. Right. You didn't ask the question I thought you were going to ask. I'm going to Russia to make it clear to the Russians and to Vladimir Putin, they have nothing to fear from NATO expansion, that a Baltic—the Baltics in NATO are positive for Russia.
Now, my answer to your question—I thought you were going to ask why I'm going to St. Petersburg. Anyway—[laughter]—and I'm going—I didn't hesitate when Vladimir and I talked about my trip to St. Petersburg, that it was very important for me to go there. And it was important for me say—explain why I think it's a positive development.
Terrorism—first of all, I've got a good friend in the fight against terrorism in Vladimir Putin. He understands the stakes,MDNM and so do I. He understands that as you embrace freedom and embrace change and—that there will be people who resent that and want to impose their will.
Secondly, I thought that at the theater that he was confronted with a very difficult situation. Eight hundred people were— were going to lose their lives. Clearly, these people were killers, just like the killers that came to America. There's a common—a common thread, that anytime anybody is willing to take innocent life for a so-called cause, they must be dealt with. And he made some very tough decisions. And people tried to blame Vladimir; they ought to blame the terrorists. They're the ones who caused the situation, not President Putin.
Thirdly, I believe Chechnya can—I hope that Chechnya can be solved peacefully, that there's ways to discuss the political dialog in such a way that this issue can be solved peacefully. Thirdly, to the extent that there are Al Qaida members infiltrating Russia, they need to be dealt with; they need to be brought to justice. And I— you know, when Usama, praising these— the Muslim attacks in Chechnya, it's clear that there is an Al Qaida interest.
That's why we're working so hard in Georgia with the Georgians to, one, encourage a dialog between Shevardnadze and President Putin, and two, develop a joint strategy to deal with the Al Qaida members which may be in the Pankisi Gorge. And so—but I will continue to talk to Vladimir about the need to protect and recognize the rights of minorities within any country and at the same time deal with terrorism. And I hope he can find that balance. I think he can.
Czech Republic and NATO
Q. Mr. President, how do you assess the performance of the Czech Republic in NATO in preparation for this summit?
The President. Yes, well, first of all, they've been valuable members of NATO. I was able to express that to your President in his recent visit—who, by the way, is an outstanding human being and is highly respected and highly regarded in all of America. NATO has been—I mean, the Czech Republic has been a—was unhesitating in its support of Article 5 in NATO, for which I am grateful. Every conversation I've had with the President, he has been nothing more than anxious for the Czech Republic to perform its role within NATO.
The interesting thing—let me give you kind of a broader statement about what you'll see at the Prague summit—is that everybody has got something to contribute in the military capacities of NATO to deal with the new threats. And the Czech Republic certainly is such a country. There's going to be—I guess, the best word will be specialization—there needs to be a specialization as we develop the military capacity to deal with the true threat.
Russia is not a threat, and therefore, the military strategies of NATO need to be changed to recognize that new reality. Russia is—Russia is a friend, not an enemy. NATO was formed because of the Warsaw Pact. The Warsaw Pact doesn't exist and, therefore, now—but there is a threat to all of us. And that is the threat in the form of international and global terrorism, which we must be able to deal with. The Czech Republic understands that. They're willing to help specialize. And it's up to the Czech Republic to determine that— along with Lord Robertson and his strategy—to determine how best to meet with the threats we face.
Obviously, we've had good relations with the intelligence service of the Czech Republic, which is one of the key ingredients in order to fight terror. If you know somebody is thinking about doing something to us or we know somebody is thinking about doing something to you, we share intelligence. We've got good intelligence-sharing with Russia, by the way, now, because of the joint threat of global terror.
It's a key ingredient in order to make sure we're able to find the new enemy. The enemy doesn't travel in army formations. They're killers. They take theaters. They crash airplanes into buildings. They bomb resorts. And we must know as much about their whereabouts and their plans as possible, in order to find them and bring them to justice. And therefore, there needs to be a different attitude about the threats we face.
In terms of the Prague summit, I am mindful of what happens when the U.S. President shows up at times. I mean, it is—you know, there is going to be a lot of noise and clamor. But I'm actually confident that the Czech Republic will do a fine job. It is a big deal that this city of Prague hosts this, and nations from all over Europe coming and—plus the Canadians and ourselves. I'm sure there's going to be people who are willing to express their voices, that maybe perhaps think NATO— something about NATO is not the way they like it, or whatever it may be. We believe in free speech. Hopefully, they'll have an opportunity to speak freely in a way that's not—that doesn't promote violence.
But the thing that impresses me most about the Czech Republic and its Government is, in spite of the terrible flood, devastating floods, that this Government and these people are anxious to host this meeting and will be able to do so in a great way. And it shows the great character of the people, to rise above the devastation to be able to host this summit. So I'm really looking forward to it. I can't wait to get there and will be there soon.
Romania and NATO
Q. Mr. President, what symbol would you associate to Romania on the new NATO map? I mean, where is the place of Romania in this new NATO map?
The President. How do you mean, what's the place? What do you mean—well, first of all, you're getting me caught—if these countries get in—[laughter]. But the fact that I'm going to your country I guess says something. [Laughter]
Q. We hope so.
The President. Right now I'm off the record. Anyway—[laughter]—first of all, the map is more than just countries on a piece of paper; the map is an attitude. It's an attitude that says that we want to work toward open markets and open societies and transparency and fight corruption. We want to participate in the global war against terror in a way that we're capable of doing so.
Physically, of course, Romania will be the leading edge of Europe extending its reach into Eastern Europe. And it's a significant reach. It is—today, it's interesting, the Vice President and I were being briefed on an issue, and we looked at the map, and the Vice President said, ""I have trouble adjusting to the actual map of NATO."" In other words, the point was that NATO now— NATO's reach is far east. And Romania represents that eastern reach. So physically it's a significant statement of the power of an alliance and the willingness of a people to adopt the habits necessary to have a free society.
It's—I think that's probably the most significant thing about the NATO map. It's an attitude. It's the soul of NATO, like I described earlier. But it's the presence of Romania—really recognizes the change. And it's a significant change. It's an historic—this will be an historic day, our meeting on one day—Thursday, I think is the day—in which the decision will be actually announced.
Lithuania
Q. Although—Mr. President, although, yes—recognize the annexation and occupation of Lithuanian, to most Americans our country was unknown territory for a long time. And can you recall, when did you first and what hear about Lithuania? And what did you think of Lithuania at that time? And what do you think now?
The President. Well, there's a lot of Lithuanian Americans who kept the hope alive of a free and independent Lithuania in America, not so much in my home State of Texas, mainly in the Midwest. And I think a lot of people took pity on the people of Lithuania, given the circumstances. And the Government took its position. But there was a patience by our leadership that eventually freedom would prevail.
Lithuania is kind of a—it's got kind of a—all the Baltics, for that matter—have got an interesting kind of romance because it's a small country. It's totally overwhelmed, divided up. It's kind of handed out as pieces of a—pieces of a settlement that saddened a lot of Americans. But nobody ever gave up hope, I think. Most Americans never gave up hope that the Baltics would some day be able to realize their vast potential.
I'm going to tell you an interesting story. This is from another Baltic country. It's from the Prime Minister of Estonia, came to see me. I'm very hesitant to put words into another leader's mouth. They tend to do it to me, and I don't like it. So I would paraphrase, loosely paraphrase. He was there at the time when—and one of the things I do is welcome a lot of leaders to America; it's an interesting experience. I have done so with the Lithuanian leadership as well.
And I said—this is the day where I told our Congress we were going to encourage a national debate and dialog on Iraq. And I started to give him my rationale as to why I was thinking about Iraq. He said, ""You don't need to talk to me""—this is paraphrasing now—about Iraq. He said, ""Our country has watched democracies go soft in the face of totalitarianism, and we lived in slavery for 50 years.""
Now, that's a paraphrase for the American press. But the point I want to make to you is that he was clear about obligations we have. That's what I think about the Baltics. The spirit—and Romania, for that matter, and the Czech Republic, as embodied in the works and thoughts of Vaclav Havel. That's what I think about your country. You know, I firmly believe that—again, I keep repeating myself, but it's on my mind because this is exactly what we're dealing with at the NATO expansion. And this is the concept of how precious freedom is for people. It is a—and it has a lot to do, frankly, with my thinking about Iraq too.
The fact that people are tortured and subjugated, aren't free to realize their potential, really bothers me. I think we have an obligation to work to free people. There's all kinds of ways to do it, but we have that obligation. It doesn't happen as quickly sometimes as we would like. But that's an obligation of all of us who have got—who live in free countries. You have that obligation. But there's no doubt you'll recognize that obligation because you're freshly free from subjugation. And that's what I was talking about, about the invigoration of the soul of NATO. That's what I think about when I think about the Baltics.
United Nations Resolution on Iraq
Q. Mr. President, you mentioned Iraq.
The President. Yes.
Q. Do you think—do you believe that Russian support of the U.N. resolution on Iraq has promoted any kind of reconciliation between the position of Russia and America on this matter? And what would you like to tell to President Putin in regard to——
The President. Oh, yes. Well, first, I appreciate them working together with us on the resolution. The U.N. Security Council sent a clear signal to Iraq and the world. We expect them to disarm, is what the signal said. And actually, the U.N. Security Council sent a signal about themselves, that they want to be relevant.
You see, if you send out 16 resolutions and all 16 resolutions were ignored, at some point in time, somebody has got to tell the truth and say, ""You're not relevant. Why pass a resolution unless you really mean it?"" And so we got together, and we said, ""Fine, let's pass this significant resolution."" And the Russians were helpful and voted for it. And now the word is out, that the U.N. Security Council will be a relevant body. In other words, we intend to enforce the serious consequences if there's not disarmament, and that we're able to work with our friends. I thought that was a very positive thing.
And I will tell this to Vladimir Putin. It's probably better for me to tell him, but not through your newspapers, but I'll try anyway. The issue is not inspectors. The issue is disarmament. That's the issue. And the question is, will Saddam Hussein disarm? That's what the U.N. Security Council has said, once again, with Russian support, along with other—a lot of other countries. And so he must show us whether or not he'll disarm, for the sake of peace.
And if he doesn't, then we, of course, will consult, like we said we would do— we'd hold a meeting. But the interesting thing about the U.N. Security Council resolution is, all countries are free to act. And that was explained to Vladimir what my sentiments—I'm very strong about. This is not a—this isn't a free pass for Saddam, now that the resolution has been passed. Quite the contrary. We expect him to disarm. And we expect him to do everything he can to disarm. And we expect him to be cooperating in his disarmament for the sake of peace.
And that's what the U.N. Security Council said to me, that people now have finally come to the conclusion that it's time now to deal with the issue. Hopefully, this can get done peacefully. But it's up to Mr. Saddam Hussein, and we'll see. It's time for him to declare if he's got any weapons. And we'll proceed from there.
NATO and Iraq
Q. Mr. President, will you ask the allies in Prague to contribute to military action if such action becomes necessary?
The President. I will—first of all, I believe that the NATO Alliance understands the issue. The countries there would like to see a disarmed Saddam Hussein. They— a peaceful country, they believe in peace, just like I believe in peace. And a Saddam Hussein with weapons of mass destruction is—particularly since he's used them in the past, and he clearly can't stand America and many of our friends—would mean it would be likely for us not to have peace.
Imagine a Saddam Hussein with a nuclear weapon. It's certainly not an ingredient for peace, quite the contrary. And so the NATO countries understand that. And if, in fact, military action is needed, we'll consult with them, and everybody will be able to make a decision that they're comfortable with. But I wouldn't preclude a peaceful settlement. I hope it happens peacefully. But if it doesn't, just—people will know that our intent is to lead a coalition of like-minded, freedom-loving countries, a coalition of the willing to disarm Saddam Hussein. And one way or the other, he's going to be disarmed, and it's in everybody's interest that that be the case.
So we'll talk about that. All right? Thank you for your time. Now, are you going on these trips? You're going to go to the NATO summit? That's going to be exciting. How many journalists will be there?
NATO Summit in Prague
Q. Two thousand seven hundred—that was the last figure I note from Prague before I came here.
The President. Two thousand seven hundred.
Q. Including TV crews.
The President. Wow. Well, I can't wait for my press conference. I'm going to have about a 2-hour press conference there in front of 2,700. [Laughter]
Q. Two days.
The President. Two days. [Laughter] Just kidding, Steve [Steve Holland, Reuters].
Q. Can't wait for that.
The President. You're going?
Q. Yes, sir.
The President. It's going to be exciting. It's going to be a very exciting time. And so you have just come from Prague?
Q. Yes.
The President. So you tell me what the feeling is like there in the city.
Q. Well, the city is almost evacuated, in expecting the summit, because——
The President. The city is evacuated?
Q. No, I'm joking, but the area around the conference center is almost evacuated. And the kids, they have holiday, and the shops are going to be closed, and the center of the city, Wenceslas Square where the demonstrations usually take place, is under police surveillance. So Prague is getting ready, so everyone is expecting how to get to work in—they are making arrangements.
The President. Yes. And how many people are coming, just total? Do they have an estimate? From outside the Czech Republic.
Q. More than 2,000 people—I mean, delegations and——
The President. Oh, it's got to be way more than that.
Q. ——with the staff and everything.
The President. Well, the press is 2,700 alone. I bet there's—our mighty delegation—[laughter].
Q. But only two hotels were affected by the floods. Only two of the number of the hotels that are ready for—to accommodate the delegations and——
The President. They're ready?
Q. ——only two hotels were badly affected by the floods. Otherwise——
The President. How is the recovery from the floods?
Q. It was bad. It was tough, and now it's getting better. There are some neighborhoods in Prague where people cannot return to their homes because of the——
The President. Still?
Q. ——and it's not only Prague. It's the whole country, going into Germany.
The President. So sad.
Q. So it's very bad. No chronicle—no person ever remembers such a disaster.
The President. It's a 500-year flood.
Q. A thousand.
The President. A 1,000-year flood. Wow, that's too bad.
Q. But as we say, Charles did it—from the 14th century. [Laughter]
President's Visits to Europe
The President. Well, I'm glad the country is recovering. We're really looking forward to it and looking forward to our trips, too. They're going to be magnificent.
Q. We expect more people than for the Pope in 1999.
The President. Really? It's going to be exciting. I'm looking forward to it. I better make sure my speech is—I think they'll like it.
All right. We'll see you there. Thanks. Thanks for coming. I'm looking forward to going to St. Petersburg again.
Q. Yes, sure. Thank you very much.
The President. The second time in one year. Maybe a third time.
Q. Did you like it?
The President. Yes, it was spectacular. Remember, we went out on the boat, Vladimir, myself, Sergey Ivanov, floated a— White Nights. Fantastic. It won't be White Nights this time, though. Will be white days, right, snowing?
Q. Yes, snowing. [Laughter]
The President. We'll see you all there. Thank you.",https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-european-journalists
Madeleine Albright,20010203,"12/10/99 Albright interview on CBS's ""The Early Show""","







MR. GUMBEL:  The two countries have exchanged heated words over Russia's military action in the breakaway republic of Chechnya.

Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is in Washington.  Madame Secretary, good morning.

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Good morning to you, Bryant.

MR. GUMBEL:  Let me start with this listening device that was found.  It was found in a sensitive area, it was extremely sophisticated, it was professionally introduced, it was very well hidden.  Does all that pretty much guarantee that this spy, Gusev, had inside help inside your Department?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  I have no idea about that and I can't comment on that.  The investigations are going forward.  It is an investigation that first had to require counter-intelligence activity and now the other investigative part of this is going on.  And may I say that we have the most exemplary kind of cooperation now between the FBI and my Diplomatic Security Service and we are, obviously, deeply troubled by this.

But let me clarify something that you said.  It is in sensitive areas of the State Department.  We operate in a sensitive business.  But not in my office or in the offices where the highest level State Department officials operate.  And so we are concerned, we are investigating it.  I was told about this several months ago and we have followed a very, very careful procedure.

MR. GUMBEL: Let me move on to Russia, if I could.  I just characterized the relationship as icy.  What adjectives would you use?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  It's pretty chilly.  But let me just say this, it is very easy to have a chilly relationship with a country with whom we were at odds for 50 years.  The challenge here is how to manage a very complicated relationship with your former adversary and sort out where we have to be very tough, as we must now, on Chechnya because of the really unacceptable toll this is taking on civilians.  On the other hand, we have a lot of business to do with Russia in the arms control arena as well as in trying to deal with various issues around the world.

I talk to Foreign Minister Ivanov on a practically daily basis and we know that we have many points of conflict but we also have many points where we cooperate.

MR. GUMBEL:  The fact is, Russia has essentially consolidated its hold over Chechnya, surrounded the city, the capital city of Grozny.  Are we powerless to stop them?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  We are in physical terms.  But what has happened is that we have, and the Europeans, have made very clear that this is unacceptable behavior.

The other thing that we are telling them is that this is leading them down the wrong path.  What is necessary is to have a political dialogue and what's called the Chairman in Office, Foreign Minister Knut Vollebaek of Norway, of the OSCE is going on a mission now, next week, to Chechnya  to be able to help in some way to get a political dialogue started.

MR. GUMBEL:  The final area I want to talk about, and it is in part congratulating you because you recently succeeded in getting the Syrians and Israelis back to the bargaining table.  What kind of US assurances did you have to give them to get that done?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Basically, what they are interested in is an American role as an honest broker.  Both parties, both the Syrians and the Israelis, trust the United States and, particularly, President Clinton for his ability to be able to be an honest broker.  And so the talks are going to begin in the United States next week.  President Clinton and I are going to be intimately involved in it.

And the whole point here is that what we managed to do was to have them stop negotiating about negotiations and begin to talk about the substance.  But it's going to be tough slogging, I can assure you of that, Bryant.

MR. GUMBEL:  Were there no promises of US forces being used, being deployed to patrol borders?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  No promises have been made, no.  What we have said is that we consider having a comprehensive peace very important.  Obviously, we have played a part in the Israeli-Egyptian peace and the Israeli-Jordanian one and we have a role, as an honest broker.  And then we try to help as we can afterwards.

MR. GUMBEL:  Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.  Always a pleasure.

I assume I won't see you in the next two weeks so enjoy the holidays.

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Nice to see you, Bryant.  You, too.

Madeleine Albright,20010203,12/17/99 Albright press remarks following G-8 Foreign Ministers Meeting,"







SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Good afternoon, I think you have heard a great deal from my colleagues and Foreign Minister Fischer was able to give you a full account of the meetings that took place here.  As you know I did not arrive until this morning and so I just want to briefly tell you that the parts of the discussion that I participated in obviously involved Chechnya and I listened to the report from Foreign Minister Vollebaek about his trip to the region, discussion about Kosovo.

Then in terms of picking up on some of the discussions on conflict prevention, I specifically focused on our interest in limiting the spread of small arms, on the importance of developing a more robust and quickly acting civilian police, on the problems associated with the illegitimate trade of diamonds, in terms of perpetuating or creating the possibility for conflicts, general problems to do with terrorism and organized crime.

I also briefed my colleagues, in a general way, on the Middle East peace talks as President Clinton and I conducted them in Washington, between the Syrians and Israelis in the last couple of days.  So that is what we have done in the last few hours and I'd be very pleased to answer  your questions.

QUESTION:  There has been a lot of talk about conflict prevention by Foreign Minister  Fischer before you came in.  We have reports of some serious fighting in Grozny.  I was wondering if you would have any more to say than you said before about your position as regards international funding to Russia in this context?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: First of all, let me say clearly the issue of Chechnya and the fighting in Grozny did occupy some time this morning and I think that the vividness with which Foreign Minister Vollebaeck described the situation, made clear to all of us that there continued to be a great need for humanitarian assistance, better coordination, the ability of humanitarian assistance to get in there and the need for further political dialogue.

I think that it is very important for us to do everything we can to aid the humanitarian effort and I think that generally we, the international community and the United States also, have had an impact in terms of the humanitarian situation, pushing in order to have borders open, corridors created.  I think, frankly, we have had a marginal affect on the political aspect of this conflict.  I think there has been a recognition by the Russians of the importance for political dialogue and some contacts between the government in Moscow and various representatives of the rebel groups and President Maskhadov, and obviously  some recognition of the fact that the OSCE mission had an appropriate role and might in fact have a longer-term role there.  I think we have had no impact militarily, however, and that has been of concern, I think, to everyone.

What has been evident at this meeting, frankly, is that the Russians through their actions are self-isolating from the rest of the international community.  That was clear today.  And that to a great extent their lack of ability to face squarely what is going on and  extending the time for when there might be a solution, that they are losing credibility and international standing.   As we look at policy options I think the important point here is to try to keep explaining to the Russians what they could and should be doing and at the same time making sure that, in the case of the United States, that we continue to pursue our national interest, which is to have a functioning relationship with Russia.  I think we have to keep remembering that that is very much a part of our short, medium and long-term goal.

QUESTION: You said it was important to impress upon the Russians the need for a political solution.  If beyond the Duma elections there is no progress and they continue with their offensive against the Chechen rebels, would you see a point when it would be necessary to consider sanctions or other punitive measures in order to reinforce the message that you are sending today?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  I don't think it is useful to speculate on specific measures such as that.  All I am saying, and I think it is very important for people to understand this, is that this kind of action that the Russians are taking is isolating them -- as I said was evident in today's meeting.  Where in the past I think there have been G-8 meetings where we were all trying to solve something together, at this one there was a different mood because after Knut Vollebaek's report, the Russians were trying to explain -- I believe not sufficiently -- their actions.

I do think though that there is no question that continued action like this does have a serious affect even on our bilateral relationship, but at the same time, I would like to make very clear, as I just did, is that it is in our national interest to maintain a relationship with Russia.  It is a very important country with which we have a lot of business and that we have worked very hard to bring closer to all of us in the last years.

QUESTION:  (in French) Excuse me, I do not speak English very well.

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: (In French)  I speak French.

QUESTION:  (In French) Thank you.  After 500 years torture is a tradition in Turkey.  How much longer will this be possible? After 500 years we expect of Turkey -- and Turkey calls itself Europe or American -- can torture in Turkey be stopped or not? After 28 years Nelson Mandela is no longer a terrorist.  The question is President Nelson Mandela is not a terrorist.  Mr. Ocalan and after 28 years is not a terrorist, the president of Turkey or Kurdistan. Thank you.

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: (In French) I am not entirely sure I understood your question, but I have to say that the definition of a terrorist is someone who commits actions against civilians who have not done anything -- against innocent people.  I know there is a difficulty -- there are people for whom someone is a freedom fighter and for others he is described as a terrorist-- but for me it is not difficult if someone takes the lives of innocent people and what is happening now is that there is a lot of terrorism in the world where there are people who have no respect for the lives of innocent people.  Because I have not entirely understood what you said, I hope that this answer will be sufficient for you.

QUESTION:  During the first Chechen war the West did succeed in getting President Yeltsin to stop bombing the citizens of Grozny.  That hasn't happened this time.  I wanted to ask you why you thought that was true?  Why is Russia more self-isolating this time?  Is it the example, misused however it may be, of Kosovo?  Is it the coming elections or do you think the Russian military is less under the control of Russian politicians?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Well, first of all, it is very hard for me to give you a definitive or even speculative answer on this.  I do not accept the similarity between this and Kosovo.  What happened that Milosevic did was to have government-directed ethnic cleansing on a large scale and a wholly different approach to how this was being carried out.  So I don't accept that analogy.

I believe that from listening to Foreign Minister Ivanov, is that they basically see this as a threat to the territorial integrity and existence of the Russian Federation and that for them it is an important goal to be able to rid themselves of terrorists.  That is their explanation.  I think because they feel that they were not able to accomplish that earlier, they now can.

That does not mean that it is an explanation that the United States accepts or that the other members of the G-8 accepted this morning.  There is definitely the feeling among the rest of us, that while there may be legitimate problems with terrorists that there is no legitimate military solution to the Chechen conflict and that the only way to accomplish what the Russians legitimately want -- which is to keep their territorial integrity -- is through a political dialogue with those representatives of the rebel groups that can engage in such a dialogue, and that there needs to be the greatest care taken for the civilians who are caught in a terrible humanitarian debacle.

QUESTION: In that respect, Mr. Fischer stated that many of the G-8, I'm quoting him now, ""are demanding an immediate ceasefire.""  Do you support that demand?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT :  Yes, we are demanding an immediate and long-term ceasefire.  We are not looking for some short-term ceasefire that just would allow people to leave --  though we believe people ought to be allowed to leave --  but there needs to be a long-term ceasefire and a political dialogue.  Yes, we did agree.

The other thing that we did all agree on and were concerned about, was the spill-over on the rest of the region from the kind of fighting that is going on in Chechnya and [there was] discussion about the affect it might have on the neighboring countries, very great concern about that.

QUESTION: Beyond intense jawboning that we've heard in the last few days and weeks, isn't there anything that the West can do that would perhaps make the Russians hurt a little bit?  There is some talk about perhaps withholding EXIM Bank funds and other loans of that sort.

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: We are all very concerned, obviously, about the fact that this continues and that is why we have been proposing a ceasefire and the protection of the civilians and the importance of a political dialogue.  There were not specific discussions about taking any other actions beyond what the Chairman of the G-8 stated.   I think what is important here is that we are all united in making clear to the Russians that this is unacceptable.   It is creating for them a situation where they are being systematically excluded from the kinds of international dialogue that we have had with them for the last ten years. Whereas for the last ten years we have been trying to bring them into things that [now] they are isolating themselves and all of a sudden being outside and that this will have an effect.  I think there are number of actions that can be taken, but at this stage what we believe is important is to keep making the case to them that there should be a long-term ceasefire, that the civilians need to be protected and that the only way to reach an appropriate end is through a political dialogue.

QUESTION:  I understand you have been seeing members of the Serbian Opposition today.  Can you say anything about that meeting?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:   I will be seeing them later. I have met them before.  We all met in Istanbul and one of the things we established, there which we will be doing this afternoon, is to have a U.S.-EU-Yugoslav Opposition dialogue in order to try to strengthen the possibilities of democracy actually at some stage coming to Serbia.  We have all made very clear that our fight has not been with the Serb people. The problems are with Milosevic, an indicted war criminal. And that there are forces, within Serbia, democratic forces that should be allowed to come to power through free elections.  That is the purpose of the discussion is to really hear from them, what they are doing and to be supportive in terms of the desire of those of us who were part of the Kosovo war to help assure the victory and really make sure that the people of the Balkans and especially of the former Yugoslavia -- have an ability to live freely and choose people of their own choice.

Thank you very much.

Madeleine Albright,20010121,2/8/00 Albright interview on CNN,"







MR. SHAW:  Joining us now to discuss this latest Middle East peace setback and other issues is United States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.

Madame Secretary, if all parties don't exercise the ""maximum restraint"" that the State Department has called for, what do you foresee?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Well, first of all, I think that it's very important that we don't get involved here -- or they -- in a cycle of violence.  The peace process is one that obviously goes through ups and downs.  It is very difficult, and we have arrived at a stage where the parties themselves have to make some very fateful decisions.  The fact that it has taken this many years to get this all done is a sign of the very many difficult decisions that they have to make.  The fact that this all started -- the Hizballah, in fact, do not have a stake in peace.  This is one of the things that happens as you begin to have some success in the peace process, that those who do not have a stake in it try to take action.  We hope very much and are encouraging restraint.

I had a conversation the last couple of days several times with Foreign Minister Shara of Syria and urged them to do what they can to control the activities of the Hizballah, and hope very much that there is not an escalation.  There is a Monitoring Group that was set up in '96 in order to try to prevent escalation here.  That Monitoring Group we believe should be meeting and should deal with this in a way that it does not escalate further.

MS. WOODRUFF:  Madame Secretary, this is Judy Woodruff.  My question to you is:  Have the Israelis overreacted here?  There are those who are saying they have escalated; not only that, they're saying they're going to ignore this four-year-old agreement not to involve civilians.

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  First of all, let me do the last point first.  They have actually not said that they were going to ignore the agreement.  I believe that the reason that they took this step is that they have been taking casualties, and they want to make very clear to the Hizballah that they will not put up with taking casualties -- but they are not ignoring the '96 understandings.  The Monitoring Group needs to meet in order to deal with the problems.

MS. WOODRUFF:  So reports to the contrary are in error?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Yes.  I think that that is not a -- to my understanding, that is not a correct assessment of what the Israelis said.

MR. SHAW:  Barry Schweid,  the Associated Press' diplomatic correspondent has moved the story, saying that Lebanon's ambassador has accused the Israelis of targeting civilians, and the ambassador has called on the Clinton Administration to stop the Israeli attacks.

Your reaction?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  First of all, I think that as I said I think the Israelis have hit infrastructure and the power plants.  I don't think that they are going after civilians, but they did want to send a very strong signal.  A number of their military have died as a result of attacks by the Hizballah that have been launched out of villages, which is something that is not part of the understandings of '96.

MS. WOODRUFF:  Madame Secretary, the United States has clearly been deeply involved in the region.  President Clinton has made numerous phone calls since the latest round and even previous rounds of negotiations were underway.  Has he been involved in the last 48 hours making phone calls here?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  The President -- we have kept him fully informed in this.  I have been making a lot of the phone calls.  We all have.  The President is obviously very concerned.  He has invested a great deal of time in this and will continue to do so.

MR. SHAW:  At the beginning of this interview you underscored, in your words, the need to avoid getting into a cycle of violence.  In a word, without -- well, I'll just ask you.  Tell us where, exactly where, are the Syrians and the Israelis on a peace agreement and the Israelis and the Palestinians?  How close are they, Madame Secretary?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  As I said, they have decisions to make, all the parties on both the tracks.  The talks that we had on the Syrian track here, first at Blair House and at Shepherdstown, I think that the process was able to move forward.  As you remember from the time there had not been meetings of this high level in a number of years, and the fact that they were together and we were actually discussing the issues that are central to the Syrian track -- withdrawal, security, water, and the timing of all this -- I think was very important.

I think progress was made, but there is an awful lot left to do and we can expect to continue to try to move this process forward.  But as I said, they have to make the decisions.

On the Palestinian track, they've had a lot of ups and downs, back and forth.  They are still working out the interim agreements, the Sharm el Sheik agreement.  I believe that after some discussion and difficulties we'll get it back on track.  I have gotten, I have to say, kind of used to the ups and downs in this, and we are not the ones that can make the decisions.  They have to make the decisions, and the U.S. is always prepared to be as helpful as we can.

Ambassador Ross was in the region last week.  He's going back again, and we're just going to keep at it.  What we do not want is to have it be disrupted by a cycle of violence.

MS. WOODRUFF:  Madame Secretary, just one last very quick question about Chechnya.  You told the Senate today that you believe the war in Chechnya will go on even though the Russians have pretty much overrun the capital city of Grozny.  Are you saying that you think the rebels there still have considerable strength?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  I'm concerned about the fact, and this is what we have been telling the Russians, that while they may have control of Grozny, that the rebels have withdrawn to the south and the west into the mountains.  These are guerrilla fighters who I believe do have resources in order to keep coming back.  And, therefore, we have said -- I said it to Acting President Putin -- that we don't see a military solution to Chechnya; there has to be political dialogue and a way for ultimately the status of Chechnya to be resolved within the Russian Federation through political dialogue.

MS. WOODRUFF:  All right, Madame Secretary.  Madeleine Albright, Secretary of State for the United States, we thank you very much for joining us.

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Good to be with you Judy and Bernie.

MS. WOODRUFF:  Thank you.



MR. SHAW:  Thank you.

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Thanks.

[End CNN Interview.  Followed by press stakeout outside CNN studios.]

MR. RUBIN:  They have a few questions for you.

QUESTION:  What the Lebanese Ambassador said:  he said Israel is violating the '96 agreement in intentionally targeting civilians, and Hizballah is fighting fair.  He doesn't say they're not attacking soldiers, but they're not using civilians as cover.

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  First of all, I think as I stated, that basically what the Israelis have done is to send a very strong signal about the fact that they don't want this escalating.  The Hizballah is -- if one is talking about the '96 understandings -- they are launching some of their attacks out of villages.  That is not a part of the '96 understandings.

The Israelis, in contrast to what has been reported, have not said that they will not abide by the '96 understandings, and we believe that the Monitoring Group, which was set up in '96, needs to meet to deal with this so that there is not an escalation.

QUESTION:  They said the Israelis are hitting power stations.  You know, they say that they're hitting the civilian infrastructure -- I mean, the Ambassador says.

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Well, they are hitting power stations, and I think that they are sending a very strong signal.  They have, however, lost a number of their military and they want to make sure that the message is received.  There is no question about that.

But what we would like to avoid is an escalation here and a cycle of violence, and we think that the Monitoring Group needs to deal with this.  I have spoken to Foreign Minister Shara to see what the Syrians can do more to control the Hizballah.

QUESTION:  And what was their response?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Well, they basically say that they're doing what they can, but I think the problem here is that the Hizballah -- I mean, this is not so unlikely as we move towards progress and peace -- this happens in many places, that those extreme groups, terrorists who have no interest in peace, take their various actions.  It's up to those who can have some control over them to make it clear that this is not the way to solve the problem.

QUESTION:  The White House guidance, the prescription, their answer, was:  Go the Monitoring Group.  Is that what you're suggesting?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Well, that's what I'm saying:  it was set up to do this.  They have been able to defuse a number of situations that are not dissimilar, and these '96 understandings have worked.  What I would really like to see is not to have a cycle of violence; the Monitoring Group work; and for us to be able to continue the kind of preparing the ground on the Syrian track with the Israelis in order to be able to move the process forward.

QUESTION:  Is Ambassador Ross going back to work on this problem or to work the peace problem, or are they the same problem?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Well, he is a multifaceted negotiator.

QUESTION:  He used to do Russia, too.

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Well, he's not going to do that this time but he is tuned in to all parts of this problem, obviously, and will do what he can.

QUESTION:  When is he going?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Next week.

QUESTION:  Are the Syrians correct when they say that both you and Foreign Minister Shara are calling for this urgent, immediate meeting of the Monitoring Group?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Well, yes.  I mean, we are calling for it.  The Israelis I think have said that they also -- I don't have their exact words, but it's my understanding that the Monitoring Group --

QUESTION:  But it's not a joint call, is it?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Well, no.

QUESTION:  The US is calling for it?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Yes.

QUESTION:  You don't need Syria to --

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  No.

QUESTION:  -- hold your hand, join hands with you?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  No.

Madeleine Albright,20010407,2/2/00 Albright remarks following meeting with Min. Putin,"







SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: I have just had a 2 hour 45 minute meeting with Acting President Putin and we covered a lot of the most important issues in the U.S.-Russian relationship.  We talked about arms control, non-proliferation, the economy, civil society, Chechnya and regional conflict.  And as I said in the speech that I gave this morning, clearly there are areas of cooperation and areas in which we disagree.  And that was evident in our discussions.  What was interesting was that Acting President Putin did say that, for them, U.S.-Russian relations are of over-riding importance and I agreed with that.  And, so we had a very, I thought, a very substantive and very useful meeting.  And I'd be very glad to answer your questions.

QUESTION:  Thank you.  In your speech, you dwelled on the problem of proliferation and you said they'd made a good start with the new regime but that you needed more action. What you did mention, at least North Korea and Iran are specific areas of concern, did you take this up with him in specific terms, and did you get anything in the way of assurances that something they're doing, they will stop doing, and if so, what is it, please?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: Well, on proliferation we committed ourselves to work together on it and that he expressed agreement with the approach that we are taking and I talked about the need for strong enforcement of Russia's export controls.  And that a process we've established to deal with that will be carried on.  He did understand the importance of what was going on.  We talked about North Korea and Iran and problems created by them in a variety of places.

QUESTION:  Madam Secretary, one of the reasons that you came here was to try to build some new trust and confidence in the bilateral relationship.  You mentioned this morning that they were going -- U.S.-Russian relations -- were going through a kind of strange period.  Do you leave with a sense that the relationship is better than when you arrived?  And what actually did you accomplish on that broader front?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: Well, first of all I think that we did several things while I was here.  And I do think that the fact that we had successful multilateral track talks was actually not a foregone conclusion. I think that the fact that it worked and that we accomplished setting up the committees has a lot to do with the fact that we worked very closely with the Russians and as an example of one of the areas in which our cooperation serves us well.

I think, though, this visit and the number of times that I've met with Foreign Minister Ivanov, and in addition to this morning's meeting with Acting President Putin, I had a sense that we are very clear about the importance of the U.S.-Russian relationship, that we have a number of areas that we have [where] agreement must be worked on.  I was impressed with the kind of can-do approach that Acting President Putin put forward in terms of issues -- those issues that I discussed.  A certain amount of problem-solving approach.  I did not feel that we had dogmatic discussions.  We had practical discussions between leaders -- him, not me, (inaudible) leader -- of countries that know that they have an essential relationship and that we have to deal with problems.

Now, on the whole, the discussion was one in which it was a can-do approach.  We didn't mince words however, either of us, on the issue of Chechnya, where we clearly continue to have disagreements.  So Tyler, I think that basically to say -- from my perspective I think it was a good trip because we are able to have an event that showed the importance of acting together .  I had many discussions in which I was able to outline our approach to issues and hear theirs.  And I think it was a good way of having a longer meeting with Acting President Putin.  It's the third time I've met him.  I was with the President when he met him in Auckland and Oslo, but, obviously, having a chance to have an almost three-hour meeting with him gave me a chance to have a better sense of, what his interests were and how he might act.

QUESTION:  Thank you.  Two questions Madam Secretary.  I know that you were saying before you got here that you wanted to deliver the message that Russia was continuing to isolate itself with the war in Chechnya.  But what was President Putin's direct response to you, if in fact you delivered that exact message, and secondly you said you met with him for almost three hours.  Before you arrived you described him as having two strands to his personality.  Did you get a better sense about which direction he's going in?  Did he share anything with you that would help you to clarify your position or his position on it?

SECRETARY ALBIGHT: First, let me say, I did in fact say what I had said I was going to say: that they were isolating themselves.  I think that -- and I'm just telling you my sense of what his sense about this is -- that to them, what they're doing in Chechnya is essential for the future of Russia.  That is the way they see it.

They see themselves as fighting terrorists and those who would like to undermine Russia.  So for them, he feels this is essential.  And, I think that, basically, while he heard what I had to say on the isolation, self-isolation issue, I don't think that it was  it's not dispositive for him given their view of how they see this.  I obviously disagreed.

I also said to him what I've said publicly.  Which is that he's riding a tiger and that we do not see a military solution to this and that there had to be a political solution to it.  We -- either while he restated theirs and talked about what he considered terrorists were doing in Chechnya and the instability that it was posing for the region, I put a number of suggestions on the table.  And in response I had proposed that there be a humanitarian needs assessment team that could go into Chechnya; something that has not been possible since the beginning of the war.  And he seemed receptive to that idea and asked that Foreign Minister Ivanov and I discuss it further, which we obviously will.

I also said to him that there was a real problem in terms of people -- that we were operating off of different facts, somehow, and therefore, that it was necessary for him to let accredited journalists go in and for there to be greater transparency.  And he seemed to take that onboard.  And, we'll see.  But, you know as I said, neither of us minced words on Chechnya, but I did put some of these ideas forward. And he seemed, you know, at least was willing to talk about them.

I don't think that we're any closer to a solution -- political solution -- on Chechnya, but I was interested in his saying that he was for greater  for some kind of stable relationship, greater autonomy for Cechnya and social and economic reconstruction there.  But I didn't hear how he intended to get from here to there.  I found him a very well-informed person and a very good interlocutor.  He was obviously on top of all the issues that we talked about.  He's obviously a Russian patriot and also someone who seeks a normal position for Russia within the West.  And he struck me as a problem solver.

QUESTION:  I don't know if there's anything more you can tell us about his manner and his demeanor with you; your sense of him as a person.  And also I wanted to ask about the ABM thing.  In your speech you said we would urge the Russians not to just say ""Nyet"" to changes in the ABM and I wondered if that was also a restatement in positions.

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: Let me take it from the bottom.  I was encouraged by the discussion on arms control and some seeming flexibility on deep cuts.  He seemed to have a common, I don't know whether we'd have the common view, but an understanding of new threats and how to deal with them while preserving the fundamental principles of the ABM Treaty.  And we talked about the importance of getting START II ratified.  So, I found him knowledgeable on the subject and, again, encouraged by flexibility.  But on all of these issues and all the discussions I had I think  -- and this also has to do with the second part of your question, is whatever impression I might have is neither here nor there.  What is important is whether there are facts that actually happen.  And how he carries out the various things that he is proposing and the actions, I think, and while I think everybody has been engaged in psychobabble about him, I think that what is important now is to watch what he does.  And that's the judgement that we ought to make.

In terms of what he's like, we had a very intensive but pleasant discussion.  I mean, we both spoke very openly about what we thought and as I said he's a very interesting interlocutor and patient, I'd have to say.  I don't think he was planning to spend almost three hours.  And there are those who say that this is probably the longest meeting that a Secretary of State has had on a first meeting with a Russian leader.  You'll have to check history for that, however.

QUESTION:  Just one follow-on to that. Did he refer at all to notes, or did he simply speak extemporaneously.

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: He was actually quite funny about that.  He held up a stack of cards and said that those had been prepared for him, but he didn't use them.  He took notes.  I also showed my cards that had been prepared for me.  And so I think that in that regard, we had a fairly -- how these things go -- informal discussion.  I've been in a number of meetings with lots of different people all over the world, where sometimes you could just exchange your cards.  But, this was one of those where I think that we had a genuine discussion.

QUESTION:  You mentioned that he seemed to show some flexibility on numbers and deeper cuts.  Can you tell us whether you discussed START III and numbers below 2,500 or 2000?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: I never said that he was flexible on numbers.  I said that, overall, I was encouraged by his flexibility and that he did talk about deep cuts.  But we never talked about numbers or any details of START III.  But, we were talking about general aspects of how to move forward and obviously again these are negotiations that are going to be carried out  -- discussions and negotiations at other levels.  At Strobe Talbot (inaudible) , as well as Foreign Minister Ivanov and I are going to be. But we did not discuss any numbers, Jane.

QUESTION:  Madam Secretary, during your discussion with Vladimir Putin today did you, at any stage, hear any indication that he intends to open any negotiations with anyone in Chechnya?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: I think that, as I said, I didn't think they were closer to a political dialogue and he talked about the difficulty of finding an interlocutor.

QUESTION: Do you think that this conflict ends with the taking of Grozny, as the Russians seemed to suggest at different points?  And the second part of my question would be, did you have any discussion about a possible summit -- a Presidential summit?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: I have said that I think it's very difficult to see a military solution to this.  And I said that to him.  And the fact that the Chechen fighters are different kinds of fighters and it's a little hard to say that having occupied Grozny is how it would end.  And, basically, one of the reasons that we've been saying to them that we don't see a military solution is that it's hard to see it ending simply by that, by taking Grozny.  He and I did not discuss a summit, though it has been part of a discussion that I've had in a general way with Foreign Minister Ivanov.

QUESTION:  Did he make the familiar promise to push for START ratification that we've heard?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: I asked him and he said he would.  Yes.

Madeleine Albright,20010407,"3/26/00 Albright on CNN's ""Late Edition""","







QUESTION: First of all, give us please your assessment of Vladimir Putin.

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: Well, he's obviously a very complicated man who has several strands to his background but, as we see him now, he is being very pragmatic. He is dealing with Russia's problems and we are going to have to watch his actions very closely and carefully.

He is showing that he's interested in some serious economic reforms. He has been open to discussion about arms control and nonproliferation issues, which are of major importance to us, but we continue to be very concerned about the campaign in Chechnya. He speaks about it a lot in terms of the problems of terrorism, which obviously every country has to deal with, but we are concerned about the displaced people and some of the terrible humanitarian consequences of the Chechnya campaign.

QUESTION: Is it your sense, though, that this is a leader of Russia that the Clinton Administration, the United States Government, can work with?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: First of all, let me say that we work with leaders of various countries that have been selected by their people. That is the job of any government, and we will not only work with him but obviously work with other members of the Russian Government and then various other people throughout the system.

When I met with Vladimir Putin as Acting President, I found him pragmatic, smart, on top of his brief, somebody who is a Russian nationalist but someone I think that we can and must work with.

QUESTION: There has been a lot of attention focused on his KGB background, the fact that he was a KGB agent in Germany during the height of the Cold War. Is that an element that Americans and others in the West should be concerned about, that he was overly influenced perhaps by that KGB background?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: I said at one point that we have to kind of stop with the psychobabble about him. He clearly has a background with the KGB, but we have to watch his actions. The Russian people are calling for order. You're there now and you know that. They feel that they've been through a fairly chaotic situation. In my mind, the question is whether it's order with a small ""o"" or a capital ""O."" I think that we have to obviously watch his actions.

I am somewhat concerned about the fact that there has not been access by the press to Chechnya and some of the issues to do with the media. There are concerns, but I think that, on the whole, what we see here is a leader who wants to be able to organize Russia in such a way that Russia can play its designated role in the international system. We prefer to have a Russia that we can work with, that has a sense of responsibility about how the international system needs to operate and be stabilized.

QUESTION: The New York Times in an editorial today says that there is some question about his commitment to democracy, noting that he is ""ambivalent about press freedoms,"" something that you just raised in the course of your comments. And others here in Moscow are telling me they also wonder how committed Vladimir Putin is to democracy.

In your assessment, how committed is he?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: I think we're going to have to see. He certainly uses all the right vocabulary and talks about the importance of having the support of the people. I think it's a mistake to prejudge him. It looks as though he is going to win this election. It's historic that the Russians are having such an election, that there is a transfer of power in a democratic and constitutional way, that the people have gone to the polls, that they are expressing their views.

I think that it's very important for the United States to be realistic about Putin and about Russia, but I don't think we should prejudge him in the way that some of the comments are. I think we've just got to see what his actions are. His words are okay, but we have to watch his actions.

QUESTION: A lot of Russians say they like Vladimir Putin and that his popularity has increased in recent months because of the crackdown in Chechnya, what many outsiders here see as a brutal campaign, a devastating campaign with an abuse of human rights in Chechnya. How much of an impact does that policy, the Russian military policy in Chechnya -- and we've all seen those devastating pictures of what's been going on over there -- how much of an impact will that have on US-Russian relations?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: I think it will have an impact. I think the people that I've spoken with are concerned about the kinds of things that are happening in Chechnya. You know, I left the President's trip in India in order to come to Geneva to give a speech before the Human Rights Commission, and among the various things that I criticized throughout the world that we felt were not up to snuff in terms of human rights was certainly Chechnya. It is very much on our minds. We believe that there have been excesses.

We have called for the possibility of an international observer presence there. The International Red Cross, the Human Rights Commission and Mary Robinson should be able to go in. There should be investigations and transparency there. So, clearly, Americans are troubled. Europeans are troubled.

I think that while Mr. Putin and many of the Russian people agree with this campaign, we do not believe that there is a military solution to the problem of Chechnya. We hope very much that very quickly now after his election that there will be a political dialogue that will resolve the issues in Chechnya.

QUESTION: Many of Mr. Putin's associates here in Moscow -- I've been here over the past few days -- have raised questions about George W. Bush's statement that the United States, if he were President, would, if necessary, unilaterally abrogate the ABM Treaty, the Antiballistic Missile Treaty, in order to build a defense missile shield in the United States.

They say that would severely rupture US-Russian relations. What do you say about that?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: We believe that the ABM Treaty is central to the arms control regimes that we've had up until now, and we also think that it can be adjusted and amended in a way that if the President should make the decision to deploy the NMD, that the ABM Treaty could be adjusted in a way to make that possible. The ABM Treaty has been amended before, so abrogating it is not something that the Clinton Administration is favoring. What we're favoring is, if the President decides to deploy the NMD, to have an amendment and adjustment of the ABM to be able to suit that.

QUESTION: On an issue that many American officials see as a source of great concern, Russian cooperation with Iran in the development of Iran's nuclear reactors. How serious of a problem is this, and is this a step that could help Iran develop a nuclear bomb?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: We have been very concerned about the transfer of technology to Iran. Nuclear reactor -- the peaceful uses is something else. But we are very concerned generally about the transfer of technology, the proper export controls, and we have been having discussions with the Russians about transfer of technology. That has been a concern, and they have taken some steps which we believe are useful, but more steps are necessary. It has been an issue of concern for us.

QUESTION: And just ahead, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright discusses prospects for peace in the Middle East and more. Late Edition from Moscow will be right back.

(Break.)

QUESTION: -- Madeleine Albright, who joined us from Geneva, Switzerland.

Madame Secretary, on the situation in the Middle East, the two tracks that the Clinton Administration is pursuing in the peace process, one involving the Israelis and the Palestinians; the second -- you're in Geneva today with the President -- involving the Israelis and the Syrians. Which of these two tracks has a greater chance of success during the remaining months of the Clinton Administration?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: Well, I'm not going to make bets on that. We are doing everything we can to get a comprehensive peace. The President and I and others have invested a tremendous amount of time in this. Ambassador Ross has gone back and forth many times, as you know, to work on both tracks, and we also want the track on Lebanon to work. We have been working on a comprehensive peace, and the talks on the Palestinian track at expert level are going on now outside of Washington. We are here in Geneva today because President Clinton believes that it's important to meet with President Assad to assess needs and policies.

We've been talking to Prime Minister Barak many, many times, and so now we've been trying to get the parties to bring their positions closer together on the Israeli-Syrian track, and we will continue to do that. We're going to try, as we can, on all tracks. But as you know, Wolf, it's very hard. The people themselves have to make the decision. We can facilitate and we can ask questions and we can try to make assessments, but the parties themselves have to make the hard decisions.

The President, in a conversation yesterday, said on the Syrian track that, ""The distance is short but the walk is hard.""

QUESTION: When you say ""the walk is hard,"" I was in Geneva in 1994 covering President Clinton's meeting then with President Assad. And as you will remember, there was great disappointment that President Assad at that time did not utter the words that many Administration officials had hoped he would utter. Has there been a shift, a serious substantive shift in Syria's attitude towards peace with Israel, that you think could result in the kind of breakthrough that you've been pushing for?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: Well, again, I don't want -- I think we have to be realistic about this. These two countries have been at odds for a very long time. On the other hand, the Syrians did come to the talks at Blair House and Shepherdstown. In my conversations with President Assad, he has indicated that he would like to find a solution -- and so has Prime Minister Barak. And so what we're doing is trying to see how we can be helpful in bringing them together and trying to reduce the distance between them.

But again, one thing that I've learned, Wolf, is not to predict success on any of these talks. They're very difficult. Each has its own dynamic. The President is putting a lot of effort into this, but there's no guarantees here. And all we can do is really try and see what the attitudes and needs and positions are, which is why the President is meeting with President Assad.

QUESTION: Madame Secretary, another issue that is of great concern to many Americans, namely the price of gasoline. As you know the, OPEC oil ministers are meeting in Vienna tomorrow to discuss whether to increase production, which presumably would result in a decrease in the price of a gallon of gasoline in the United States and elsewhere around the world.

Many Republicans have criticized the Clinton Administration's policy of, in effect they say, begging these oil ministers, friendly oil states, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, to go ahead and increase production. Is it unseemly? Is their criticism justified?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: Definitely it is not justified. I mean, what we've been doing is consulting with the producing countries in order to try to get a way for them to make a decision to stabilize prices that would be suitable for consumers as well as the producers. I think this is the way things are done and they obviously make their own decisions, but it's important to get those prices stabilized.

QUESTION: Do you think they will be stabilized as a result of the OPEC meeting in Vienna?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: Always hopeful, but it's hard to tell. Again, they have their meeting tomorrow. We'll see how it comes out.

QUESTION: All right, and we'll all be watching. Madame Secretary, thanks so much for taking some time from your busy schedule. Good luck in your peace efforts in Geneva and beyond.

Madeleine Albright,20010407,"11/22/99 Albright interview on STV, Bratislava, Slovakia","







[Note:  The interview was conducted in Slovak and Czech]

QUESTION:  Dear Madam Secretary, according to your statement and also according to the statement by President Clinton, Slovakia has made a great deal of progress on its road towards democracy, particularly in the political realm.  But as you have said in your lecture at the Comenius University today, there are still many people here who have problems to survive.  People who have difficulties to make ends meet on their salaries.  In your view, is this caused by objective reasons or are there also any specific subjective errors made by the current government which have caused that.  In terms of economy Slovakia still lags very much behind its political and democratic reforms.

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  First of all, I have to say that things are completely different here in Bratislava, in Slovakia now.  One has to look at what's going on now.  I think that the Slovaks can congratulate themselves on everything that has happened here since the 1998 elections.  Because with the change in the government, changes have also started to be noted in the way people perceive economic reform, what people think about their position in the world, how you're getting ready to become part of Europe.  So, in my view, a lot has happened indeed.  There is a problem, however, in that years have been wasted as you were not an integral part of the development in central Europe.  And now there is a lot of work to be done to make up for these losses.  But I think this government and the Parliament and all the others are working together to make something really important happen so that the economic reforms really help people.  The problem is that some of the decisions are tough and at the beginning it is more difficult for people than what will happen later.  The truth is, however, that such important decisions have to be taken so that it all works well in the end.  I think that Slovakia is on the right track now.

QUESTION:  In the past, Slovakia was often criticized for its approach to the rights of national minorities.  Much has improved in that respect.  The members of the Hungarian minority are also represented in the government and in the (presaedium) of the Parliament.  But the problem which has currently emerged is that of the Roma minority.  Does the United States have any proposal, does the United States see any possibility of how to resolve this problem in an effective manner, be it within Slovakia or in the framework of  the whole central Europe.

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  In the first place, these problems are not only found in Slovakia.  They are present everywhere in Europe and there are problems with minorities everywhere.  But the problem with the Roma indeed is a problem and we discussed it with Prime Minister Dzurinda when he visited America, when he was in New York and also in Washington.  And we reflected upon this issue.   Because it is not only a Slovak problem, and we have to talk about it.  When we were in Istanbul now, it is mentioned in the OSCE charter that more has to be done for the Roma.  And I think that this is an issue where the Slovaks really have made significant progress when they have done something for the Hungarian minority through the law on minority languages.  I think it is very important that something be done everywhere.  The Czechs are having tremendous problems with the Roma.  We know that the Hungarians, the Romanians, and Bulgarians are as well.  So it is not only here and all these things have to be done together.

QUESTION:  The principal foreign policy objective of the Slovak Republic is integration in the European Union, NATO and the OECD.  As regards the European Union, we are now expecting a positive signal to be sent out by the Helsinki summit of the European Union.  But our citizens are certainly also interested in other dates.  Could you give us a (inaudible) as to when Slovakia could become a member of the OECD and NATO?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  In the first place, we hope that Helsinki will bring about steps that will lead to your membership in the European Union.  It is very important and we have seen that to receive a positive report concerning your economic reforms, it's very good, it's very important and we support it.  We also support your entry into the OECD because that means you will be able to be part of the economic world where things happen and that is very important.  Now the situation with NATO is as follows.  You are now a part of the Partnership for Peace, which is very important.  You already cooperate with NATO in Bosnia, Kosovo, Albania and in Slavonia so all this is very important so you really are our partners.  So the decision taken in Washington in spring this year that by the year 2002 at the latest, a decision must be taken on who will be the next parties to join NATO.  At the moment a plan is being worked out.  It is called the Membership Action Plan according to which any nation which wants to join NATO has to look at how to proceed.  It is kind of a road map.  So we cooperate with you in order to show you what has to be done and how things should be broken down in the budget, what things have to be done for the Army so that it will become ready to work together with NATO because the I think, and I said that to the students this morning, one has to view NATO as the biggest alliance, the most important one in the world, both the military and the political one.  So the countries really have to be ready to join it because otherwise NATO would not be NATO because it would be weaker.  What must happen is that any nation which joins NATO must contribute rather than take away.  So now you have time to prepare, we shall work together with you.  People will arrive here, and not only from America, but also from other NATO countries to help you.

QUESTION:  With respect to integration into NATO and particularly in regard to the Kosovo conflict and the NATO campaign, the public opinion of the citizens of the Slovak Republic regarding integration of Slovakia into NATO has dropped considerably.  What argument would you use to convince those people who do not wish Slovakia to join NATO?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  First of all it's very important to understand what has actually happened in Kosovo.  When I was a child, my father was the Czechoslovak Ambassador to Yugoslavia.  So I started my life as a small girl together with my father there and we loved the Serbs.  They were a wonderful nation.  They behaved wonderfully during World War II.  I then studied under Communism and I know very well how Yugoslavia spoke about Communism -- that it should be overcome -- and I know that many Czechs and Slovaks and Poles really loved Yugoslavia and the Serbs.  But the Serbs who were committing the atrocities in Kosovo and before that in Bosnia, are not the ones that we once loved.  These are people who were told by Milosevic what to do and Milosevic is nothing but an ordinary dictator.  Milosevic is an awful man who thinks about nothing else than what he wants.  So what we had to do as NATO was to end that terrible ethnic cleansing which was happening there and I think we have stopped it and therefore I hope the Slovaks will understand what has happened there.   And that NATO works to prevent such horrible things from happening.  And for me, I think, it's very important to be in NATO because it is something like a link which shows how people view the world and political values.

QUESTION:  In regard to the NATO enlargement, the position of Russia is very important and as it is generally known, Russia is categorically opposed to the NATO enlargement.  In your lecture at the university today, you have also said that Russia has no right to veto NATO enlargement.  In spite of that, the role of Russia is important enough not to be overlooked.  So don't you happen to see any potential threat or risks that may bring the international situation to a head or ones that might lead to the emergence of new tensions in the case of further NATO enlargement to the east?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  I don't think so, because we shall continue to point out that NATO is not against Russia.  And once there is a new Russia, and this is what they insist that they are building -- a new Russia, then the new Russia does not have to be afraid of the new NATO.  And I think that we want to cooperate.  I mean there is an organization which brings us together.  We meet them there since the talks about stability started and as I said in my lecture, the Russians do not like it but I think it will be important in the years to come to show that this is not meant to be against Russia.  And if I may refer back to Kosovo and Bosnia, the Russian army is there with us.  They work together with us in Bosnia and Kosovo.  We are working there together.  So in the long run, we envisage the possibility of cooperation between NATO and Russia and things may really evolve in such a way that people who do not have to be afraid that Russia would be angry.  I think that after all this is better for the stability of central and southern Europe.  I think that we can achieve understanding with Russia.

QUESTION:  Another problem which threatens stability in the region, specifically the Caucasus, is the current conflict in Chechnya.  Russia insists that it is an internal matter of Russia.  The United States and the international community are of a different opinion.  What steps can the United States and the international community take in your view to, on the one hand, convince Russia that this is not a mere internal conflict of Russia, because it is a matter of human rights, and what possibilities are there for the international community to mediate or to restore peace in Chechnya?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:   In the first place, when we speak with Russians about what is going on in Chechnya they refer to these events as their fight against terrorists.  They say that tough action must be taken against these terrorists and this is exactly what Mr. Yeltsin has said in Istanbul.  The truth is that we all have problems with terrorists.  But we are concerned with how the Russians pursue this matter now.  They are committing atrocious things against the civilians.  So we are quite worried about humanitarian conditions there.  Mrs. Ogata, of the United Nations, who has recently visited the area, has said that the conditions for the people there are just horrible and that people are fleeing Chechnya.  And when we were in Istanbul there were 54 OSCE-member nations attending the event and 53 of them had something negative to say about how the Russians pursue their campaign with the use of their army.  The best method of how to resolve this issue is through political means.  So there must be some kind of political development in order to bring this to an end.

What has been decided there is that the Chairman of the OSCE, at present it is the Norwegian representative, Mr. Knut Vollebaek, will have to go there and try to find a political solution, a political outcome to this situation.  So we hope this will take place soon because what we hear is not good.  And what we think in particular is that the Russians are pursuing a wrong avenue because when they had the war two or three years ago they lost it because there were terrible things happening there in those days.  After all they cannot go on for years and years being embroiled in conflicts of this nature because they will end up being shot at by different guerillas and they would become dragged into the war even further.  So the best possible solution is some kind of a political settlement.

QUESTION:  Some of the American media, even of the TV station CNN, have presented some speculations to the effect that allegedly a quiet diplomatic agreement exists between Washington and Moscow in that if Moscow shows more understanding and tolerance towards the United States campaign against Iraq, against Saddam Hussein, then the United States might have a more tolerant view of how Russia is tackling the problems in Chechnya.  Is there any justification for these kinds of speculations?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  No there isn't.  Because in the first place it would not come to that at all.  Because we are of the opinion that this is a completely different matter, as can be seen today, Saddam Hussein has said himself they are not going to sell more petroleum and this is a very cynical attitude on his part because in this way it is evident that Saddam Hussein simply prevents his people from having enough food and medicine.  The only thing we want is for them to give up, to relinquish those horrible weapons of mass destruction.  So those speculations that you refer to are unfounded.

QUESTION:  In conclusion Madam Secretary, permit me to come back once again to the relations between the United States and Slovakia.  The American Congress has recently adopted a resolution which has made a very positive assessment of the development in Slovakia.  I'm interested to know what is the specific significance of this resolution?  What is being opened now for Slovakia?  How would relations between the U.S. and Slovakia evolve as a result of this resolution?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Well, first of all, I think that everything indicates that our ties with the new democratic Slovakia are becoming ever closer.  I think that the resolution was meant to demonstrate that we indeed support the current development in Slovakia, the economic reforms, the work performed by the government, led by Mr. Dzurinda, and we all cooperate and we keep in mind that Slovakia should become an integral part of Europe.  And such a resolution is a very clear indication of the fact that there are many members in the Congress who support Slovakia which is important, but the work which has to be done for Slovakia to join NATO, as I have described it already, I think that this will need some more work.  But this is a very clear manifestation of the English word, ""goodwill,"" goodwill toward Slovakia and that's very important.  And that is something that you have got to build upon because such goodwill will not remain if nothing happens, if there is no action.  The truth is that the momentum which has been there since this new government started its current work has to be taken even further.  It is not easy.  We all know it is not easy, but it is necessary to continue to work in order to keep the goodwill alive.

QUESTION:  Madam Secretary, thank you for this interview.

Madeleine Albright,20010407,10/26/99 Albright and Minister Van Aartsen remarks,"







SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Good afternoon.  It is a pleasure to welcome Foreign Minister van Aartsen to Washington today.  America's friendship with the Dutch dates back to the American Revolution.  The ties between our peoples began even earlier when Puritans took refuge in the Netherlands before coming to our shores.

Today, the Netherlands is one of America's most important partners in trade and investment.  It is a NATO ally and a firm friend of democracy and peace in Europe and around the world.

Just last week I had the pleasure of seeing our partnership in action when I reviewed, with a Dutch colleague, a battalion of peacekeeping soldiers from Mali.  The United States provided their training and the Netherlands will fund their deployment to Sierra Leone -- an excellent example of how we can work together to accomplish goals neither could do alone.

Today, the Foreign Minister and I discussed a number of issues facing our NATO alliance including European efforts to develop a separate European defense identity.  The United States welcomes European efforts to develop a common security and defense policy, and to enhance Europe's capability to perform NATO and EU missions.  We ask, and I believe our Dutch partners agree, that such a process be effective and efficient, and that it serve to strengthen the trans-Atlantic link.

We also reviewed progress in the Balkans, where the Netherlands played a key role in ending the fighting and is now a central part of efforts to bring lasting peace.  I thanked the Foreign Minister for his country's generous contributions to the Balkan reconstructions.

We discussed the ominous developments in Chechnya.  Both our nations are deeply concerned by the escalating violence and mounting civilian casualties.  We urge Russia not to repeat the mistakes of the past in Chechnya, and instead to open a dialogue toward a peaceful resolution with legitimate Chechen partners.

The United States and the Netherlands are also close partners on the UN Security Council, where the Dutch are serving a two-year term and doing an outstanding job as chair of the Iraq sanctions committee.  This morning, the Foreign Minister and I discussed the situation in the Persian Gulf, and the next steps we must take to ensure that Saddam Hussein does not again threaten his neighbors in the region.

And, finally, I took the opportunity during the meeting to thank the Foreign Minister for his country's strong support of the UN Mission to East Timor, and the forthcoming UN presence in Sierra Leone.

So in Kosovo or New York, or Africa or NATO, our two nations have a proven record of partnership that serves our interests and promotes our ideals.  And I look forward to working very closely, as we have been, with the Foreign Minister to extend that record, and build our friendship, during the remaining days of this century and into the next.

Foreign Minister.

FOREIGN MINISTER VAN AARTSEN:  Madame Secretary, thank you very much for your kind words.  Today we had a very constructive discussion on several topics.  You mentioned them already.  I completely agree about what you said about Chechnya because a warning towards Russia is necessary, I think, in this respect.

And every time, again, it strikes me how our two nations share the same principles and the same values which are deeply rooted in our societies, and how close in fact both our visions are in world events.

We have discussed the wish of the countries of the European Union to strengthen its common foreign policy by developing a defense and security policy.  The Netherlands Government strongly believes that the development of a European security and defense policy should be fully compatible with NATO.  Full transparency between the EU and NATO is vital; therefore, the Netherlands Government proposes to set up a consultative, or consultative arrangements, between the EU and NATO and to secure the involvement of those NATO members that do not belong to the EU, such as Turkey and Norway.

On Iraq, we confirmed our shared commitments to end the suffering of the Iraqi people, to reach consensus on the current outstanding issues, unconditional implementation of the UN Security Council resolutions on Iraq, and establishing an effective monitoring system.  The Netherlands will work closely together with the other Security Council members to this goal and the Netherlands Government introduced  together with the UK  a draft resolution which has been supported by 11 members of the Security Council up until now.

Secretary of State stressed once again the continued support of the Administration for the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and its entry into force.  In talks I had yesterday with members of Congress I stressed how crucial this treaty is for global nonproliferation and for a safer world.

Thank you.

QUESTION:  Madame Secretary, one of the areas of the world you haven't touched on is India-Pakistan, where India says it has repulsed a Pakistani offensive.  Evidently, four Pakistani soldiers were killed.  It looks like a Kashmir flare-up again, despite assurances on both sides lately.  Could you validate or substantiate there is a problem there, and if you have something to say about it?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  First of all, let me say that Mr. Musharaff when he made his statement had said that he would withdraw forces from the international border and, as far as we know, he has done that.  This, unfortunately, is the time of year when there have been incidents on the line of control and what we would hope very much is that both sides do whatever they can to reduce tensions, and we have made that quite clear.

Obviously, I have not had a detailed report in terms of being able to verify for you the specifics of what you asked, but I think that the point here is that he did say he was going to withdraw them from the international border.  We would also like it done on the line of control.  But the issue, as I've said, this is the time of year, unfortunately, where these kinds of incidents do happen.

QUESTION:  Madame Secretary, the Dutch Government later this week sent an official trade delegation to Cuba headed by the Dutch trade minister.  Did you discuss this topic with Mr. van Aartsen and what do you make of this decision which is not in line, not at all in line, with US policy towards Cuba?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Actually, we didn't have a chance to talk about it, but I must say the following thing, that we believe that it is very important if anyone goes to always make sure that human rights issues are raised and that there is a chance for visits with as many of the dissidents as possible.

We also, in our discussions with Europeans, have always made clear that it is important for there to be support for a transition to democracy and non-investment in any of the expropriated properties.  That is something that we feel very strongly about.

We, ourselves, have been trying very hard to put in a set of measures that would allow there to be space for the Cuban people because the embargo is actually Castro's embargo against the Cuban people.

QUESTION:  So the US doesn't send official trade delegations?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Excuse me?

QUESTION:  The US does not send official trade delegations?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  No, we do not.  But we have ways that we let humanitarian missions or people go in in order to try to make clear our support for human rights.  We believe that it is important if anyone goes -- we obviously prefer that people don't go on trade missions-- but that it be very clear that there is support for democratization and the human rights agenda and that there not be any investment in expropriated properties.

QUESTION:  Yes, Madame Secretary, the Russian officials had some very strong words yesterday on the consequences of proceeding with the National Missile Defense.  I wondered how concerned you are that the whole of the arms control regime is in danger of collapsing?  And do you have any response to what the Russians said on that?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  First of all, I do not think that the whole arms control agenda is in danger of collapsing.  I think, as the Foreign Minister said, the United States has made very clear  the President has made very clear  that we would abide by the moratorium on testing that the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty would bring about, and that we will continue to have a full discussion of the value of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, not only to the United States but to the world, and that we would continue to press aggressively for an arms control agenda.

I must say, though, that I was troubled by the reports today of some statements by the Russian military that I think are an overreaction to our desire to deal with what we believe is a common problem, which is the threat that comes to all our countries from rogue states acquiring weapons of mass destruction and that we have a joint interest  we and the Russians and others  in dealing with that problem.  So I don't want us to -- anybody, whether here or in Russia -- to be reviving old problems.  We should be trying to solve new problems.

QUESTION:  Mr. van Aartsen, you just mentioned the enormous agreement between the United States and the Netherlands on matters of foreign policy.  Now Secretary Albright just showed that on Cuba there is a serious difference of opinion in the approach to Cuba.  Is that a matter of difference of opinion that you just agree to disagree upon or are you still trying to work it out?

FOREIGN MINISTER VAN AARTSEN:  As the Secretary of State has said, we haven't discussed it during our meeting and I don't think there is a serious difference of opinion here.  As the Secretary of State said, it is important when these sort of missions are going to Cuba, that they have a strong human rights element in it.  And as you know, the human rights element of the visit of Mr. Ybema has been strengthened over the last days.

QUESTION:  Madame Secretary, in your meetings tomorrow with Romano Prodi of the EU, I'm wondering what you think the major issues will be.  And also, Mr. Foreign Minister, if you could comment on what US-EU issues you think are important to be discussed.

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  First of all, I think the President is looking forward very much to his meeting with Mr. Prodi.  They have developed a very good relationship previously when Mr. Prodi was prime minister and they  we also believe that there are a whole host of issues to be discussed with the EU.  Some of them will obviously have to do with trade issues; some will have to do with the Balkans and our policies.  I'm sure they will also talk about Chechnya.

I think there will be the full scope of issues and I know from talking with the President that he's looking forward to it.  I have had discussions with Mr. Prodi myself and I think that we are very encouraged by what he has done in terms of putting together a new commission and really working very hard in terms of how he sees the European agenda.

FOREIGN MINISTER VAN AARTSEN:   Well, I think the Secretary of State gave the whole agenda away.  (Laughter).

QUESTION:  Madame Secretary, it sounds very much like the Egyptians are taking a pass on the meeting in Oslo.  If that's true, what do you make of it?  Are you surprised by it?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  First of all, I'm not sure that all the decisions have been made on the attendance at Oslo.  I know that it's a meeting where  the purpose of which is really to honor Prime Minister Rabin and everything that he did to move forward the peace process.  We hope very much that the meetings there again will enable us to continue to push on what is vital to the region and to the United States, which is a continuation of the peace process.  I don't want to make a judgment about something that I haven't heard definitively one way or the other.

Thank you.

Madeleine Albright,20010407,"1/2/2000: Albright on NBC's ""Meet The Press""","







Do you believe that Boris Yeltsin resigning, accepting immunity from criminal prosecution, setting the election date in Russia in March rather than June is undemocratic?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: No. I think that, actually, what has happened is they have done this transfer of power in a democratic, transparent way. We have to remember the great role that President Yeltsin played. I mean, he was the first democratically elected president of Russia. He has abided by a variety of democratic principles and I think that this transfer of power to an acting president is something that we believe has taken place democratically, moving the elections up or things that happen in other societies.

I think what is very important here though is that the democratic aspects of what Yeltsin has done need to be continued. We were quite encouraged by a speech that Acting President Putin made in the last 48 hours in which he talked about the importance of freedom of expression, of association, of press and his dedication to a rule of law. We are going to be watching, obviously, very carefully.

There are kind of two strands, I think, to Acting President Putin. You described the KGB part and Mr. Yakushin did. But also we have to remember that he has been a prime reformer. He was deputy mayor in St. Petersburg under Sobchak and took a lot of steps that indicated his interest in economic reform and we are going to be looking for actions in terms of economic reform and perpetuation of the rule of law.

MR. RUSSERT: His first official visit, as I mentioned, was to Chechnya, giving hunting knives to the Russian military. His popularity in Russia is based largely on his execution of the war in Chechnya. Aren't you concerned about that?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: Well, he's riding a tiger in this. I think there is no question. I mean, he has based a great deal of his style on what is happening in Chechnya and the fact that he went there. But I think we believe that there is a very dangerous aspect to this in terms of quagmire and that he needs to develop some kind of an exit strategy.

We have argued for a long time that the only solution to Chechnya -- and one can't say that the Russians don't have a problem in Chechnya; they clearly do. But that there can only be a political solution to this. There have been some negotiations with a variety of Chechen leaders. We have urged them, as have other European allies, to find a political solution. That is the only way they are going to make this work.

MR. RUSSERT: Do you think the Russian Government has committed atrocities in Chechnya?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: I think what has happened is they have, in fact, taken wanton action against the civilians. We understand that they do have a problem with terrorists and I think that if we had had three apartment buildings blown up in Washington as they did in Moscow, and they do have concerns about terrorists. But what we have criticized them for, as have the Europeans, is action against innocent civilians who have been pushed out of Chechnya and really a lot of them have obviously died.

MR. RUSSERT: Why were we so surprised by Yeltsin's resignation? We never got a heads-up.

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: Well, there were lots of rumors about it and there have been for a long time. But, as Mr. Yakushin said, the Russians themselves were surprised. I think that Yeltsin has always been a man of the bold move and seizing the historic moment. But obviously there have been rumors for some time about it but everybody was surprised, as they've said.

MR. RUSSERT: The fact that Putin is a KGB agent, former, 16 years, uses words like ""dark-skinned people must be annihilated, find them in the latrine and kill them."" How tough of a person is he?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: Well, I also do not know those quotes. But let me just say this: He is a tough person. I have met him with the President. He is somebody that is very determined, action-oriented. I think we are going to have to watch his actions very carefully. But, as I said, there are these kind of two strands to him and I think that actions we will be watching. We believe that it is very important to have this productive relationship with the Russians.

I have spoken to Foreign Minister Ivanov so many times in the last weeks and, basically, we talk about the importance of cooperating on a number of issues that we agree on, we disagree on others. But I think we have got to be really careful here, Tim, not to recreate an enemy. You asked Yakushin about a cold war. We are not expecting that. We have a lot of issues that we have to work in common. The arms control agenda is a huge one.

Nonproliferation is a major issue for us in the 21st century and the Russians need to be a part of that, they need to ratify START II, we need to move on to START III, where there would be reductions. We need to deal with this issue of NMD and the ABM. So we have a large agenda with them and we are going to be working it.

MR. RUSSERT: You just heard any modification of the ABM in order for us to build a missile defense system apparently is not something the Russians are going to go along with.

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: Well, at this stage, they are not eager about that. But we have negotiations going on. My deputy, Strobe Talbott, has been very much involved in that. He will continue to be. I will be. We believe also in the centrality of the ABM treaty.

But we also are looking at new threats and the NMD system is not directed against Russia; it doesn't threaten them. We are concerned about the threats from states that are acquiring weapons of mass destruction.

MR. RUSSERT: We will build it, the missile defense system, with or without Russia's approval?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: Well, the decision hasn't been made. The decision to deploy is something that the President would be making later in the summer. But that decision has not been made. It will be based on whether it works and whether it suits our security needs and whether it is useful to the United States in dealing with the threat.

MR. RUSSERT: Are you comfortable with Vladimir Putin being in charge of Russia's nuclear arsenal?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: I think that he is a competent man and we believe that Russia is running according to a rational system. There are lots of people in the government that we work with and our experience with Acting President Putin so far has been good. But, again, actions are very important and I don't want to recreate an enemy here. I think it is very important.

MR. RUSSERT: Will President Clinton go to Russia to meet with him?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: I think that has not been determined but they have spoken on the telephone and we are all in contact all the time.

MR. RUSSERT: We have to take a quick break. We will come back and talk more on the world's hot spots. And then our political roundtable about Iowa and New Hampshire, Millennium resolutions, a lot more coming up right here on Meet the Press.

(Commercial break.)

MR. RUSSERT: And we're back.

Joining me in the questioning this morning, NBC's Andrea Mitchell.

MS. MITCHELL: Thank you. Good morning. Happy new year, Madame Secretary.

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: Happy new year to you.

MS. MITCHELL: You talked about freedom of expression in Russia. Why are we ignoring the fact in China that China has been rounding up tens of thousands of people because of their religious beliefs?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: We are not ignoring it; we have made many statements about it and continue to say that we cannot have a completely normal relationship with them so long as they have this kind of very bad human rights record and have made very clear that what they are doing with the Falun Gong and other religious leaders and people of conscience is unacceptable.

MS. MITCHELL: But we don't punish them. We don't link trade or economic policies to their human rights abuses. Yet while we continue trading with China, we continue the embargo against Cuba. Why do we continue that embargo when we treat China in this very different fashion?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: Well, first of all, I think it is very important, at the dawn of the 21st century, to understand the importance that China has played and will continue to play as the most populous nation and with huge and important power in Asia. We have a complex relationship with them; we will continue to do that.

We believe it is very important for us to have trading relations with them. Bringing them into the WTO, I think, has been a major accomplishment of the Clinton Administration in this last year. And also dealing with them on issues of proliferation, where their record has, I think, been improving and is very important to us. And, therefore, we have that kind of a relationship with them.

Cuba, the law of the land is an embargo. We believe that it is very important to try to expand the space for the people of Cuba to be able to have some freedom away from the government. That is why we have taken a whole set of measures to try to make sure that more people can travel to Cuba from the United States for humanitarian reasons, that they are able -- more people can send remittances. They are different countries in terms of Cuba being 90 miles off our shore and that the embargo is the law of the land.

But the China issue is so important because they are the growing power of the 21st century and it is essential for us to engage with them on a multitude of levels, not forgetting our own principles.

MS. MITCHELL: One of the big irritants right now between Cuba and the United States is the fate of a six-year-old boy, Elian Gonzalez. When I was in Cuba recently, Fidel Castro told me that he thought Bill Clinton really wants to return this child but is hampered, for the moment at least, by the politics of Florida. Is that the case?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: No. I think that what is happening here is the Immigration, the INS service, is the one that is making the determination and they are in the process of dealing with what is obviously a very hard decision. This child cannot be made a political football and that is where President Clinton, as we all, are.

MS. MITCHELL: If the father can prove that he is the proper parent, the custodial parent, and since our laws do say that biology should -- the biological parent should have the child if he can prove that he is the proper parent -- and, by all accounts down there and by our interviews with him he is -- then should the child be returned if the immigration officials believe that he should be returned?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: I think that we are waiting for a decision from the immigration people and the question is who speaks for the child. That is what they are looking at and this is a decision that INS is making.

MS. MITCHELL: But if they make that decision, that the father should speak for the child, do you believe that the child should go back to Cuba?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: I am not going to state what my personal views on the subject are. But the INS is making the determination and we will do what -- the way they come out on this.

MS. MITCHELL: And do you think that decision will be made soon or will this be allowed to drag on endlessly?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: I have a sense that this decision will be made within the near future. Nobody wants us to drag on. It is clearly a very difficult issue and the child -- I think we do all have to think about the child and that he can't become a political football.

MS. MITCHELL: You are going to be involved in very crucial talks tomorrow on the Middle East. Israel, Syria, a lot at stake. The President has been quoted telling associates that he believes there could be a comprehensive agreement between Israel and Syria in 90 days. Is that really possible?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: First of all, I think we've got to see what's happening tomorrow in context. It really is a remarkable time. For 50 years, we have been dealing with how Israel is recognized within its region. We've had peace with Egypt since the '70s and then with Jordan. And now having an agreement with Syria would really put a very important -- place another keystone or the keystone, I think, in many ways, into this thing as we are dealing also with the Palestinian issue, which is at the core. So this is a very big deal.

But we are all going into this with open eyes. I mean, this is a huge historic opportunity. Talks of this level have never taken place between Syria and Israel. But because there are so many fateful decisions involved in it, I think it will be a very difficult set of negotiations and we are all hopeful and basically Prime Minister Barak would like to see this move. So would the President. But we are not really putting a time frame on it.

MS. MITCHELL: Very briefly, do you think that if you have an agreement that Barak can sell it and have it approved by a referendum, especially with water rights and things like that, that are so crucial?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: I think water rights are clearly an important part. And what this agreement is going to be about are the areas of withdrawal of security, of what the peace looks like, you know, what is the character of it and the time table and water rights. Those are the issues that we are going to be talking about. They are bringing their experts to talk about all of that.

I think that Prime Minister Barak knows what he can do. He clearly has said that he has to sell this at a referendum and I think that he is going to be looking at how to do this. This is why these issues are so difficult: The leaders themselves have to make the decisions. The US can be a facilitator. I am going to be there the whole time in Shepherdstown, the President will be coming in as often as necessary. He will be deeply, deeply involved in this and we hope to be able to take advantage of this historic opportunity.

MR. RUSSERT: You sound reasonably optimistic.

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: I am neither optimistic nor pessimistic. I am clearly very much seized with the idea that we are doing something this historic, that the opportunity is there and that these two -- that President Assad and Prime Minister Barak are prepared to make the fateful decisions. But, Tim, they are very, very hard decisions and therefore I am prepared to roll up my sleeves and work with them and they are, more importantly, prepared to roll up their sleeves and really work on the issues.

I think we have to be very realistic. We don't know how long it is going to take. I think that we will assess where we are at the end of the week and we are just going to keep working it. It is too important not to give it our full attention.

MR. RUSSERT: Another difficult area, Iraq. One year ago, the inspectors were told, ""Get out,"" by Saddam Hussein. Do you believe that Saddam Hussein has more weapons of mass destruction now than he did a year ago?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: Well, we are very obviously concerned about his ability to reconstitute and we are keeping him in his box and the no-fly zones are being monitored and, as you know, we occasionally have to take military action as our planes are illuminated or our pilots are in danger.

We are concerned about the fact that there are not inspectors on the ground and, as you know, we tried at the United Nations to ensure that that would happen. There is a new resolution which requires the inspectors to go in and that is the law, the international law at this stage. Saddam Hussein has turned that down. And we, obviously, have reserved the right that if we see that he has or is reconstituting his weapons of mass destruction, that we can take action on that.

We want to make -- we have set up a regime whereby the inspectors could go in and that is the way that Saddam Hussein could make sure that sanctions might be suspended.

MR. RUSSERT: Let me show you what the President said a year ago and get your sense of it as we look at it today: ""A rather scary threat to regional stability becomes increasingly alarming. Iraq's dictator, Saddam Hussein is successfully staving off attempts at the United Nations to reinstate weapons inspectors in his country.""

One year ago, President Clinton himself summed up the likely consequences of allowing Mr. Hussein to go uninspected for too long. ""Mark my words, he will develop weapons of mass destruction, he will deploy them, he will use them.""

It's been more than a year. Aren't we concerned what Saddam has done this past year?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: We are obviously concerned. As I said, I think that we have been successful in keeping him in his box and in terms of the threat to the region. We worked very hard on this resolution. We think it is unfortunate that Saddam Hussein has not taken advantage of it because it -

MR. RUSSERT: And the Russians, French and Chinese oppose us.

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: Well, they abstained. But what's interesting here, Tim, in their as they call it explanation of vote at the United Nations, they made clear that they believed that Saddam Hussein must abide by what the United Nations -- the resolution is.

MR. RUSSERT: And if he doesn't, what happens?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: I think that we still continue to have the possibilities that we've had before of taking unilateral or multilateral action if we need to. But I think we should -- I can't say that we have accomplished everything we've wanted with Iraq. But we, I think, are on the right track in terms of keeping them, as I've said, in the box, of working with the opposition and working towards regime change, and making quite clear to the neighboring countries and to the rest of the world and our partners at the United Nations that what Saddam Hussein is doing is unacceptable.

MR. RUSSERT: Madam Secretary, we thank you for joining us. Happy new year.

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT: Happy new year to you. Thank you.

Madeleine Albright,20010407,12/12/99 Albright interview on Face the Nation,"







QUESTION:  Madame Secretary, welcome.

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Thank you.

QUESTION:  You're here in our studio this morning.  A very troubling thing, it seems to me:  the State Department has now warned all Americans traveling abroad to take extra security precautions between now and the first week in January.  It says there is a possibility or you have information that there may be attacks planned where large gatherings of people are taking place, celebrations and so on.

What can you tell us about this?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Well, basically, we believe we have an obligation to let the American people know when there are potential terrorist threats, and we are concerned about Americans traveling abroad and being in large groups.  And we are suggesting that if they do travel abroad, that they be in touch with the American embassy and the consulate, and take care.

QUESTION:  Well, now, there will be some large gatherings in this country, of course, on New Year's Eve, Times Square, down on the mall here in Washington.  Do you have any security concerns about those gatherings?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  I think we always have to be vigilant, but the one that we put out was for Americans abroad and it is not something that, as we see it, is targeted against Americans here.

QUESTION:  You know, you do this -- the State Department does this from time to time, but this one seems a bit more ominous in some way.

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Well, I think we are concerned, obviously, because there are a lot of activities going on, and I think that there are more specific indications.  But we don't want to discourage people; we want people to be very vigilant and we want people to contact our embassies.  If people want more information, I suggest that they get in touch with our website, which is www.state.gov.

QUESTION:  Let me ask you, this is obviously aimed at -- you're worried about some sort of a terrorist attack.  Could it be Usama bin Ladin?  Is it anything to do with him?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Well, let me say there are a number of groups that we are watching, obviously.  For some time we have been concerned about Usama bin Ladin, but these are -- there are a variety of groups that we have been concerned about and are watching.  And we are concerned -- there is no question about it -- and we have to be vigilant, which is why we put out the warning.

QUESTION:  More than one group?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Probably, yes.

QUESTION:  Madame Secretary, peace talks start next week between Israel and Syria.  We have a wire report this morning that said that Syria's foreign minister is so optimistic that he is confident that a peace deal can be reached with Israel within a few months.

Do you agree with that assessment?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Well, you know, what is great is that this is the first time that we have had this kind of high-level meeting between a Syrian foreign minister and an Israeli prime minister, and I felt when I was on my trip there last week that there was a sense of optimism and a desire by both parties to stop talking about talking and getting down to negotiations.  There clearly are very hard decisions to be made and they are going to be talking about four basic areas; that is, withdrawal from the Golan Heights, the mutual security arrangements, the content or character of the peace, and the timetable.

And what we hope will happen while they're here this week is that they will set out the agenda for -- obviously, there will be more talks.  And I had a sense of optimism after I had my meeting with President Asad, but nobody should underestimate this is going to be tough going, but this is an amazing moment and there is a sense that a historic opportunity is present.

QUESTION:  Do you think this is the closest they've ever come right now?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Well, certainly they've never met at this level and I think that that is very hopeful, but I think there are lots of things that are going to have to be talked about.

QUESTION:  Let me also ask you, we have a wire story that says that this morning Israel signaled that it would look to United States taxpayers to bankroll any pullout from the Golan Heights.  Would we be willing to finance that?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  First of all, I think it's kind of premature to discuss it, but as a matter of record --

QUESTION:  They're saying it.

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Well, but I think that as a matter of record we've seen that after Camp David that the United States Congress and the administration came forward with some assistance after Wye.  And I think we've got to remember that if we manage this, this would be 50 years of work that will have been accomplished for a comprehensive peace that I think everybody will cheer and be happy to contribute to.

QUESTION:  You just called this an ""amazing moment.""  Tell me why it's an amazing moment.  What made it so?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Well, I think on my trip what was interesting was even from the minute that I landed in Saudi Arabia and met with the King and Crown Prince Abdallah, there was a sense there that they wanted -- they also, the Saudis, saw this as a time for moving forward and a time that we had to seize the opportunity.

And when I met with President Asad, I got a sense some 20 minutes into the meeting, that we were going a somewhat different direction, that there was -- again, that people were tired about negotiating about negotiations.  And Prime Minister Barak has had such energy about getting into the peace process issues and obviously has set deadlines for the Palestinian track.  And then when I met with Chairman Arafat, he also wanted to see that track move forward.

And what I have made quite clear is that we can do -- or they can -- we are there as the honest broker; the parties themselves have to make the decisions.  But this is a time when the tracks can move forward on their own speed and we are not going to do one track at the expense of another.

QUESTION:  Would we be interested in participating or leading an international peacekeeping force?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  I think that is a premature question, and I think that we'll see how it develops.  Neither party has asked us to do that, and I think we've got a ways to go before such questions can be answered.

QUESTION:  Madame Secretary, I have to ask you about this thing that happened last week.  We all learned about that somehow or another the Russians apparently put a very sophisticated listening device in a conference room on the very floor of the State Department where your office is.

Do you know yet how it got there or how long it's been there?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Well, first of all, let me say I consider this a very serious matter and we have worked very hard -- the Diplomatic Security Service has worked very hard with the FBI.  I was briefed about this a couple of months ago.  They had been working on this, and we stopped it; we discovered it. And I think that that's very important.

The other point I think is important for your viewers is, while it was on the same floor that I'm on, the State Department is a huge square building and this is on the other side of the square and the most sensitive offices, which are my corridor, none of those have been -- we've swept those and there was nothing there.

QUESTION:  But as yet, you don't know how it got there or how long it's been there?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Well, this is under investigation and I do not know the specifics of that, but I think that we are going about it just the right way.  We are very concerned about how this happened and tightened security, obviously.

QUESTION:  In a broader sense, does this say in some way that perhaps the Russians are stepping up their spy activities now?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  I wouldn't characterize that.  I think the thing that we have to remember is that spying is an old form, that it's always been going on.  It's our responsibility to protect ourselves against it.  We have to do a better job.  I have been consistently tightening security from where I found it.  We have specifically tightened a whole host of policies.

Our problem, to a great extent, is resources because at the same time that we're doing this we've got the problem with trying to make our buildings overseas secure against terrorists.

QUESTION:  Is it possible that there is a mole in the State Department?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  I'm not going to speculate on that.  They are questioning people in terms of trying to find out, you know, witnesses to things, but I'm not going to speculate on something like that.

QUESTION:  But the fact that they're questioning people, it makes you think that this could have been an inside job because they hid this bug in molding and --

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  I can't comment on the details of it, but the questioning is not in terms of questioning suspects; it's mainly trying to find out who saw what and trying to piece the story together.  And what I've done is, my Assistant Secretary for Security is not a diplomat. I can't disparage diplomats, but I now have a 27-year veteran of the Secret Service who is my Assistant Secretary, David Carpenter, and he is going about this in a very, very systematic way.

QUESTION:  Just one more question about this.  Do you know, or is it possible to know, if serious security leaks came out of this?  I mean, were there discussions in this room that we wouldn't have wanted the Russians to know about?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  This is not, as I said, in the most sensitive part of the State Department and, as far as we can tell, a lot of the meetings there were not the kind that would be the most secret or sensitive, as far as we know.

QUESTION:  Let's talk a little bit about this young boy that's become the center of this diplomatic situation between Cuba and the United States.  What's going to happen here, Madame Secretary?  Shouldn't this boy be sent back to his father?  I mean, in any court in this country when there is a father there, wouldn't he have rights over anyone else's rights?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Well, first of all, we have to remember that this is a case where there's a little boy involved in it and then, also, there are various legal provisions.  The Immigration and Naturalization Service is going through processing.  We have sought, or the INS has sought, to interview the boy's father and there has been no response from Cuba on that.  And I think that what we have to do is follow through the legal parts of this, and that is what we're doing.

QUESTION:  Will you return the boy without an interview?  Do you have to have an interview?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  I think that we believe that INS is doing the processing; they are the ones that are in charge of it.  I'm not going to speculate on that, but I think that the boy -- I mean, Bob just said that often the parental rights -- and what has to be established here are the parental rights and the father needs to be interviewed.

QUESTION:  Do you have any message to Fidel Castro on this?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Well, the main thing that I have is just a general message, is to remember that this is a little boy and not a political football.

QUESTION:  Let's talk a little bit about Russia.  Mr. Yeltsin this week said perhaps the United States has forgotten that we are a country with nuclear weapons.  Is that a threat?  Is that something you take seriously?  It sounds kind of scary on first hearing.

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Well, we don't take it as a threat and Prime Minister Putin indicated that it was not.  I think that we clearly are watching a very difficult situation in Russia -- a country that has been a superpower, our major adversary that is going through a very difficult time.

I think that was President Yeltsin was doing was basically reminding the world that Russia counts.  We met with President Yeltsin -- President Clinton and I -- in Istanbul.  He is a fierce defender of Russian national interests and energetic and, at the same time, we have a lot of business to do with Russia.

QUESTION:  Some people say that maybe he was just drunk.

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  I'm not -- you know, I think that he was stating the case that Russia needs to be recognized. And one of the problems, if you think about it, here was a country which for 70 years was out there as a superpower that's going through very, very difficult changes, and I think we have to recognize that.

QUESTION:  Realistically, Madame Secretary, what can we do about Chechnya?  You have a situation where the top Russian commander has said we won't allow these people to survive the winter.  What can you do?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Well, let me just say the Chechnya issue is, again, a very difficult one.  The Russians were concerned about terrorist threats.  They had buildings that were bombed in Moscow.  There was an attack by rebels from Chechnya into Dagestan.  And they were concerned about that.

The international community -- we, as leading it -- have made very clear that while they may have a terrorist problem they can not deal with this by indiscriminate bombing of civilians and that they need to understand that the only solution to this is a political solution.

What has been hopeful in the last day is that Prime Minister Putin has indicated that they are beginning to talk to some of the representatives of the Chechen leader Maskhadov.  There is a mission going from the OSCE in the next couple of days and the international community, the Europeans with us, have been talking about a political solution.  It is very bad -- there is no question -- and we're very concerned about the civilians.

QUESTION:  But you seem to see just a glimmer of maybe good news here?

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Perhaps.  I want to be very realistic about this.  They have a goal:  they want to make sure that Chechnya does not keep causing them problems.  On the other hand, I think that they have understood the international pressure to some extent and there is a sense that Russia is becoming isolated.  We're having meetings next week in Europe.  I'm going to be in Berlin where we're meeting with the G-8.  The Russians are the eighth member of that.  And, clearly, this is going to be a topic of discussion and so they know that this is on our minds.

I have talked to Foreign Minister Ivanov practically every day.  We are either talking about resolutions at the UN or about Chechnya or various things, and they know how seriously we take this.

QUESTION:  Madame Secretary, thank you so much.  It's an understatement to say you've got a busy week ahead of you.

SECRETARY ALBRIGHT:  Well, thank you.  It's great to be with you both.

Colin Powell,20030501,Interview With Russian Television NTV,"INTERVIEWER: Welcome to Russia.
SECRETARY POWELL: Thank you very much. It's good to be back.
QUESTION: Well, you were not unanimously welcome to the two countries you came last. There were suicide bombings in Saudi Arabia and Russia, Chechnya. President Putin said that these two series of terrorist attacks actually had the same origins. You agreed with him. In that case, do you suppose, do you think that the Chechen guerillas, Hamas, Hezbollah, and Al Qaida guerillas are all the same?
SECRETARY POWELL: They're all the same in that they are terrorist organizations that that are determined to use violence, the killing of innocent people to achieve an end. They say it is a political end, but very often I think it is nothing but a criminal end. And, so to the extent that we all have to go after terrorists, these are all linked as terrorist organizations, and we have to find a way to direct the anger of people, the anxiety of people, the frustration of people, the hopes of people into a political process and away from any suggestion that criminals who call themselves terrorists have a place in the civilized world. 
QUESTION: Mr. Secretary. There are two extreme opinions. The Chechen fighters in the mountains say they're fighting for national liberation and say in Moscow, most of the political leaders, I would say absolute majority, are convinced that it's international terrorism. Where is the truth?
SECRETARY POWELL: The truth is for someone else to decide, not me. I know that there are terrorist organizations in Chechnya. We have through our own information and through our own resources identified several of them that we have put on our list of terrorist organizations and have taken sanctions against them. We have to be very careful to make sure that when we identify, at least in our system, organizations that are conducting these kinds of attacks that we can justify with information and intelligence that they are terrorists, that they are using terrorist financing, and that they have no interest in the political process. They have no interest in anything but killing innocent people. Often cloaked in the context of a political objective, but very often not in that cloak. And, as a result, it is important for people to reject this as a way to find a solution. What we saw in Saudi Arabia yesterday when I was there. It wasn't directed at me. I only recently announced my visit, only for a week. They'd been planning it for a long time. They were going after American interests. They were going after a partnership between Saudi Arabia and Americans that benefits both Saudi Arabians and Americans. How dare they? Why should they? Who are they? Where do they get the right to use bombs to kill innocent people sleeping in their beds? They don't have such a right. And, what we are seeing throughout the world now: two attacks in Chechnya in the past two days, attack in Saudi Arabia, attack in Yemen, attacks elsewhere in the world. Is this to be in any way tolerated? Is this to be in any way justified? What kind of world do we become? What sort of future will there be for the civilized world if we don't come together and fight this kind of terrorism where it exists?
QUESTION: Two questions follow from what you have just said. Is why did it take the United States such a long time to list the Chechen guerillas in the terrorists list? It took September 11 to happen so that the United States realize that Chechnya is a place of international terrorism. Why so long?
SECRETARY POWELL: We realize that Chechnya is place where there are terrorist organizations, but we have a system of laws, a system of regulations where we are required under our law to make an examination of information provided to us, intelligence we can gather. And we go through this because we are a nation of law and we apply the laws in a very, very careful way. It is not a matter of just snapping your finger one day and the next day saying I designate you as a terrorist organization. It is because of the record of terrorism and information that I can present to our Congress or to a court that justifies my placing the name of that organization on our terrorist list. It takes time, and in this instance it took some time.
QUESTION: And, the second point. The terrorist attacks in Saudi Arabia. Do you think this is a response to American victory in Iraq? 
SECRETARY POWELL: I think it is Al Qaida. We can't be absolutely sure, but my judgment it is Al Qaida. And Al Qaida has been targeting American interests for years. They targeted our ship in Yemen when they blew a hole in it and killed a number of our young sailors. They targeted our embassies in Africa. They targeted New York City and Washington and they brought another plane down in the countryside of Pennsylvania, one of our states. And, so the Al Qaida organization has been attacking America across a broad front over many years, and this was a continuation of that attack, not directly linked to what we did in Iraq. They have this view that somehow the Saudi government should not be free to invite the American presence in Saudi Arabia because it serves the interests of both Saudi Arabia and the United States. They do not approve of that, they don't like that, so they've been trying to drive us out Saudi Arabia and out of that part of the world but for a number of years. But, we have friends and we have interests in the Gulf Area, in the Middle East and we will represent our interests and we will defend our friends and to the extent that our friends want our presence in the area, either our political presence, our diplomatic presence or, on occasion, our military presence. We will be there to help our friends. What's interesting is, the Iraq war has now been concluded, the active combat phase, and we have just announced that most of our troops will be leaving Saudi Arabia. So, what basis was there for an attack on that rationale? None whatsoever. It is just part of this terrorist, criminal, murderous organization reaching out, and nobody should try very hard to find some way of justifying their action by saying that, well, Americans shouldn't be in Saudi Arabia. Americans should be doing more here or other nations should be doing more there. And, if you don't do so, then this one organization, Al Qaida, led by we don't know who right now, has the right to go get bombs, to go get guns, to go get all kinds of terrible weapons to kill innocent people who might be sleeping in their bed. Not going after an armed enemy, but going after targets where they know they can get access. In the case of New York City, people who came from 90 different countries, who just went to work in the World Trade Center -- ninety different countries represented in the World Trade Center. Should they have all been sent to their death because this one organization, outside all the rules of law, outside any norm of civilization, decides that they have some misbegotten cause, and they should have the right to do such a thing? No. We must strike back. We must respond. To these kinds of organizations or similar organizations, wherever they appear. And no country is invulnerable. No country is safe from this kind of attack. 
QUESTION: When you say you don't know who runs Al Qaida now. You mean that you don't know what the fate of Bin Laden is? 
SECRETARY POWELL: I do not know whether he is alive or dead. 
QUESTION: Mr. Secretary. My colleague journalists describe a rather troublesome situation in Iraq. It's chaos in Baghdad. It's chaos in the countryside. And Basra, for instance, as well. And somebody talks about the possibility of a domino effect, in a sense that we can get this chaos spreading in the Arab world. Now, connecting to that President Putin, before the beginning of the war, always said, ""America and us are partners. And because we partners, I must warn them they are making a mistake."" After your meeting on Wednesday with President Putin, did you have a feeling that he's changing his mind?
SECRETARY POWELL: No. President Putin felt very strongly that the United States should not undertake military action. He worked both in the UN Security Council to make that position well known and he talked directly to President Bush about it. Foreign Minister Ivanov, my colleague, he and I had the most intense discussions about this issue. We had strong disagreement here. And I would not expect either President Putin or Foreign Minister Ivanov to say that they didn't have that strong view and it's all behind us. We did have a disagreement, but because we are partners we can talk to one another directly. In the most heated way. And now that that matter has been resolved, we did what we felt we had to do, Russia felt the need to criticize our actions, but that does not break up the partnership. There are so many other things that pull us together. The desire now to work together in the United Nations for a new resolution that will help the Iraqi people and not to fight old battles. And the United States and the Russian Federation are pulled together by our economic interests, by our common commitment to democracy, and to the opening up of markets. We want to help Russia with accession to the World Trade Organization. We have delegations going back and forth talking about agricultural issues and commercial issues, trade issues, and investment opportunities. I, earlier this week when I was in Moscow, also here in your city, I also talked to a group of leaders who came together to talk about a new problem, HIV/AIDS. And, we have some experience and we can help Russia with our experience. And so, there are so many things that pull us together, and so many mutual interests that we have, that those things that pull us together will cause us to have a strong partnership. I'm absolutely confident of that and I'm sure that will be demonstrated to the world when our two Presidents meet in St. Petersburg in the near future. And, it was also demonstrated when the Duma ratified the Treaty of Moscow reducing the number of strategic nuclear weapons on both sides.
QUESTION: Mr. Secretary. You talked about this a second ago. The resolution to allow to lift sanctions on Iraq. Now, Russia has a different point of view. You have threatened the world, the United States, for a year and a half that there are of mass destruction in Iraq, and so far nobody has found them. So, if the war was carried out because of weapons of mass destruction, so maybe let's let the inspectors go back and make us all sure in the world that there aren't -- or there are, but the fact that they're not found yet, the weapons of mass destruction, isn't it troublesome?
SECRETARY POWELL: Well, we have started to identify some vehicles that are very suspicious in nature and look quite similar to some of the vehicles that I presented in my speech to the United Nations on the fifth of February. So we'll continue to examine those vehicles to see whether they are mobile biological laboratories. We are going through a great deal of documentation that our troops have picked up, and we have thousands of experts and soldiers who will be examining the entire country and look at suspected sights. Whether or not there is a role for UNMOVIC to play in the absence of the Saddam Hussein regime is an entirely different situation. This is something they'll have to examine. I'm aware that some of our Security Council partners, including the Russian Federation, believe that there is a role for UNMOVIC. We believe that that may not be the case any longer. But it's an area that we'll have to debate. I don't subscribe to the domino theory, that what we have done in Iraq will necessarily bring down regimes all over the area. What we have done in Iraq is get rid of a terrible dictator. A dictator who we know was developing weapons of mass destruction. You tell me why he didn't let the United Nations have full access. You tell me why he didn't turn over the documentation, why he didn't account for all the things he has been doing for the last 12 years. For 12 years, he ignored the UN. We also know that he had such weapons. He has used such weapons in the past. And, on top of that, he terrorized his population, he wasted the revenue of the people on weapons and on building up a military force to threaten his neighbors. He killed people. He murdered people. We're now finding mass graves, full of innocent people who were murdered by this regime. And, so the United States is not going to apologize. Nor are our coalition partners going to apologize for undertaking this military operation which will determine whether there are any remaining weapons of mass destruction and bring the truth out in due course. And also have the effect of bringing down a dictator, and the world will be better off for it, is better off for it, and the people of Iraq will be better off for it. And they now have an opportunity to use their oil wealth to build a better country that will be a democratic country. That's not a domino theory meaning the United States is going to go somewhere else and do the same thing. Not at all. But, what we might have is an example to the region of what can happen when you don't have dictators around and when you're willing to use the wealth that you have in the ground, your oil, for good purposes.
QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, I would like to clarify one detail, which is very Russian. Because on the eve of war, now we know about it, Yevgeniy Primakov, a former Prime Minister and former Foreign Minister had his last mission to Baghdad. He was asked by The Kremlin to go to that mission. He told Mr. Saddam Hussein, that if he wants to save his country from a tragedy, if he wants to avoid a war, he must go. Saddam Hussein did not, as we know, agree, and the war started. Now, did you know about this initiative in the United States? 
SECRETARY POWELL: I knew about a number of initiatives to include Mr. Primakov. Mr. Primakov wasn't the only one who was conveying this message to Saddam Hussein. Many of the Arab leaders were conveying this message to him. Others in the world, other leaders in the world were saying to him,""Why are you bringing us to the brink of destruction?"" But, Mr. Hussein thought that he could stop the will of the international community. He got certain comfort and certain confidence from debates we were having in the Security Council, where it was clear that some members did not want to support the use of force. But, he misunderstood the determination of a number of the members of the Council and a large, willing coalition led by the United States and the United Kingdom to actually take military action. And, so he had an opportunity to come clean. What was he hiding? What would have been -- if he wasn't hiding something, why didn't he just say, ""I'll give you everything, I'll show you everything, you can send in anybody you want, anywhere you want to go. I will no longer stand in the way. I will no longer make these little moves to make it look like I'm cooperating when I'm not really cooperating."" He had his chance. He had his opportunity. It was the United States that went to the United Nations last September and presented the case and said to the United Nations, here's a dictator, here's a regime that for 12 years has been ignoring this international body, and what are we going to do about it? And, we worked for seven weeks. We passed a resolution supported by the Russian Federation, 15 to 0. And, everybody said they're guilty. That's what the resolution said. Iraq has been doing this. Now they have to come clean. And, if they don't come clean, and if they don't show the inspectors everything they have then serious consequences must fall. Everybody agreed to that. 15-0. We then had a serious debate as to whether or not they were really cooperating. And we could not resolve that disagreement. Some said give the inspectors more time. The United States and a number of other nations said no. All they are doing is trying to stretch it out and make sure that nothing happens. And so, they are using the United Nations against itself and we did not believe that that could continue. So we used the authority of that Resolution 1441 and earlier UN resolutions to undertake military action.
QUESTION: Secretary. There is a strategic problem now. Because the United States, the West, NATO, and Russia as well in a certain sense have two fronts. Afghanistan and Iraq. There is a threat that -- or danger, if you want -- that Afghanistan is going to be forgotten because Iraq is going to draw more and more resources and needs and Afghanistan will remain overlooked. We know that it is an enormous drug production place and that this narco money is sponsoring international terrorism. So, how to solve this?
SECRETARY POWELL: I'm not aware of the Afghan government in any way sponsoring international terrorism. .
INTERVIEWER: No, no.
SECRETARY POWELL: I do know that we have a drug crop problem in Afghanistan.
INTERVIEWER: That's right.
SECRETARY POWELL: And we are working on that. We are trying to find crop substitution measures that we can use to convince Afghan farmers that they ought to invest in something that benefits their country and not grow a crop where all the money flows out of the country. So, it is a major problem and I recognize that. But, we haven't forgotten Afghanistan. There are still American soldiers in Afghanistan. NATO is now getting ready to send a force into Afghanistan and a headquarters into Afghanistan. We're putting hundreds of millions of dollars into Afghanistan. One of the last things I did before leaving Washington to come on this trip, was to meet with our assistance officials to make sure that the construction of the road, a major road that will connect all the major cities, that the paving of that road, the construction of that road is well underway. So, I spend time during my week on Afghanistan, on Iraq, on relations with the Russian Federation and all the other many challenges that face a Secretary of State. So we have not forgotten Afghanistan. We took on a responsibility to help Afghans build a new society, and we are meeting that responsibility. We help put in place a democratic government, women are now back in the workplace, in education, in the health care system. We're building hospitals, we're building schools, we're building a new army that will protect the nation from the warlords, and from outside influence. We are able to do that and at the same time deal with our responsibilities in Iraq. We picked up the same kind of responsibilities when we conducted our military operation in Iraq, and we knew the challenges we would be facing. It's been difficult. We have a lot more work to do with respect to security, stability, rebuilding the infrastructure. But, we understand the challenge and we will meet the challenge as we have in the past. 
QUESTION: So, Mr. Secretary, the United States, according to interviews that you gave in the recent past is taking a new responsibility, the Middle East crisis, the Palestinian and Israeli crisis, and you said that its President Bush's priority now, and the roadmap is the road to peace as outlined. Given that the Palestinian side seems to be accepting, at least the new Prime Minister, seems to be accepting the roadmap. On the Israeli side you have conditions and resistance. How far is the United States ready to go to force this peace - this road to peace - on Israel?
SECRETARY POWELL: You can't enforce something on a democratic nation. What we can do is try to create conditions where both sides see it is in their interest to come together and follow a particular path to peace. We have had very candid conversations with the Palestinian side and with the Israeli side this week. We hope that a meeting will be coming up soon between the Israeli side and the Palestinian side. Mr. Sharon will be coming to Washington in the next few days in order to discuss these issues with President Bush. And so this is the beginning of the process. There are strong feelings on both sides. What makes this situation new is that we have an elected Prime Minister of the Palestinian people, not Mr. Arafat, who was not an effective leader. He may still be seen as the leader of his country, but he did not lead his country toward peace or toward a Palestinian state. We now have a Prime Minister with authority, Abu Mazen. And President Bush has been waiting for a responsible interlocutor and Prime Minister Sharon ahs been waiting for a responsible interlocutor. So, we will find a way forward. President Bush is determined to find a way forward. 
QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, you said that Yassir Arafat is not anymore a leader, that you don't consider him a leader. He is not a partner for peace. You said in previous interviews. Now, is that position of the United States shared by say President Putin? Does he agree with you that Arafat is no more somebody you can have, you can deal with? 
SECRETARY POWELL: No, I would not presume to speak for President Putin And he can speak for himself . I know that he -- as we -- recognize that Yassir Arafat is the elected president of his people and his people look to him as their leader. What I was saying, what we have said previously, is that he is a failed leader, in that for all these years, that he has been the head of the PLO and the head of the Palestinian people, the leader of the Palestinian people, he has not brought them closer to peace, he has not brought them closer to their dream, which is a Palestinian state. And so we felt strongly that new leadership had to emerge and we now are seeing that new leadership emerge. Not because the United States put in that new leadership but because the Palestinian people through their legislature decided that they needed new leadership and so they created the position of Prime Minister. Not the United States. They brought forth Abu Mazen, named by Mr. Arafat and approved by the Palestinian legislature to be their Prime Minister, and to be given authority as Prime Minister to begin discussions with the Israeli side and with the American side so that we could find a way to move forward to the goal that we all have, and that's a Palestinian state living side by side in peace with Israel.
QUESTION: In Moscow, among the very influential politicians, there is a view that the Quartet, which is working in the Middle East, is a very effective way of solving complicated situations. Now, if you don't say agree on something, like the figure of Arafat, is it not going to make it one plus three instead of four?
SECRETARY POWELL: No. The Quartet agreed on the roadmap. Each member of the quartet has a different view with respect to Chairman Arafat, but the Quartet agreed on the roadmap. We are trying to use the roadmap as a way for Palestinian leaders to emerge and to represent the interests of their people. You can have more than one leader in a movement or in a government. We feel strongly that we have seen Mr. Arafat's leadership over the years. And, I personally have worked with Mr. Arafat for a year and a half before we formed the Quartet. And, frankly, he was not getting the job done or needed to move the peace process along and get closer to the day when the Palestinian people would have a state of their own. The Russian Federation has a different view. The UN, a different view. The European Union, a different view. I respect their views. But, where we found common cause, was the creation of a roadmap that shows the way forward to these two states. One state and one state to be -- the state of Israel and hopefully, a Palestinian state which will emerge -- and they can live side by side in peace. Thank you very much.
INTERVIEWER: Thank you very much.

INTERVIEWER: Welcome to Russia.

SECRETARY POWELL: Thank you very much. It's good to be back.

QUESTION: Well, you were not unanimously welcome to the two countries you came last. There were suicide bombings in Saudi Arabia and Russia, Chechnya. President Putin said that these two series of terrorist attacks actually had the same origins. You agreed with him. In that case, do you suppose, do you think that the Chechen guerillas, Hamas, Hezbollah, and Al Qaida guerillas are all the same?

SECRETARY POWELL: They're all the same in that they are terrorist organizations that that are determined to use violence, the killing of innocent people to achieve an end. They say it is a political end, but very often I think it is nothing but a criminal end. And, so to the extent that we all have to go after terrorists, these are all linked as terrorist organizations, and we have to find a way to direct the anger of people, the anxiety of people, the frustration of people, the hopes of people into a political process and away from any suggestion that criminals who call themselves terrorists have a place in the civilized world.

QUESTION: Mr. Secretary. There are two extreme opinions. The Chechen fighters in the mountains say they're fighting for national liberation and say in Moscow, most of the political leaders, I would say absolute majority, are convinced that it's international terrorism. Where is the truth?

SECRETARY POWELL: The truth is for someone else to decide, not me. I know that there are terrorist organizations in Chechnya. We have through our own information and through our own resources identified several of them that we have put on our list of terrorist organizations and have taken sanctions against them. We have to be very careful to make sure that when we identify, at least in our system, organizations that are conducting these kinds of attacks that we can justify with information and intelligence that they are terrorists, that they are using terrorist financing, and that they have no interest in the political process. They have no interest in anything but killing innocent people. Often cloaked in the context of a political objective, but very often not in that cloak. And, as a result, it is important for people to reject this as a way to find a solution. What we saw in Saudi Arabia yesterday when I was there. It wasn't directed at me. I only recently announced my visit, only for a week. They'd been planning it for a long time. They were going after American interests. They were going after a partnership between Saudi Arabia and Americans that benefits both Saudi Arabians and Americans. How dare they? Why should they? Who are they? Where do they get the right to use bombs to kill innocent people sleeping in their beds? They don't have such a right. And, what we are seeing throughout the world now: two attacks in Chechnya in the past two days, attack in Saudi Arabia, attack in Yemen, attacks elsewhere in the world. Is this to be in any way tolerated? Is this to be in any way justified? What kind of world do we become? What sort of future will there be for the civilized world if we don't come together and fight this kind of terrorism where it exists?

QUESTION: Two questions follow from what you have just said. Is why did it take the United States such a long time to list the Chechen guerillas in the terrorists list? It took September 11 to happen so that the United States realize that Chechnya is a place of international terrorism. Why so long?

SECRETARY POWELL: We realize that Chechnya is place where there are terrorist organizations, but we have a system of laws, a system of regulations where we are required under our law to make an examination of information provided to us, intelligence we can gather. And we go through this because we are a nation of law and we apply the laws in a very, very careful way. It is not a matter of just snapping your finger one day and the next day saying I designate you as a terrorist organization. It is because of the record of terrorism and information that I can present to our Congress or to a court that justifies my placing the name of that organization on our terrorist list. It takes time, and in this instance it took some time.

QUESTION: And, the second point. The terrorist attacks in Saudi Arabia. Do you think this is a response to American victory in Iraq?

SECRETARY POWELL: I think it is Al Qaida. We can't be absolutely sure, but my judgment it is Al Qaida. And Al Qaida has been targeting American interests for years. They targeted our ship in Yemen when they blew a hole in it and killed a number of our young sailors. They targeted our embassies in Africa.

They have this view that somehow the Saudi government should not be free to invite the American presence in Saudi Arabia because it serves the interests of both Saudi Arabia and the United States. They do not approve of that, they don't like that, so they've been trying to drive us out Saudi Arabia and out of that part of the world but for a number of years. But, we have friends and we have interests in the Gulf Area, in the Middle East and we will represent our interests and we will defend our friends and to the extent that our friends want our presence in the area, either our political presence, our diplomatic presence or, on occasion, our military presence. We will be there to help our friends. What's interesting is, the Iraq war has now been concluded, the active combat phase, and we have just announced that most of our troops will be leaving Saudi Arabia. So, what basis was there for an attack on that rationale? None whatsoever. It is just part of this terrorist, criminal, murderous organization reaching out, and nobody should try very hard to find some way of justifying their action by saying that, well, Americans shouldn't be in Saudi Arabia. Americans should be doing more here or other nations should be doing more there. And, if you don't do so, then this one organization, Al Qaida, led by we don't know who right now, has the right to go get bombs, to go get guns, to go get all kinds of terrible weapons to kill innocent people who might be sleeping in their bed. Not going after an armed enemy, but going after targets where they know they can get access. In the case of New York City, people who came from 90 different countries, who just went to work in the World Trade Center -- ninety different countries represented in the World Trade Center. Should they have all been sent to their death because this one organization, outside all the rules of law, outside any norm of civilization, decides that they have some misbegotten cause, and they should have the right to do such a thing? No. We must strike back. We must respond. To these kinds of organizations or similar organizations, wherever they appear. And no country is invulnerable. No country is safe from this kind of attack.

QUESTION: When you say you don't know who runs Al Qaida now. You mean that you don't know what the fate of Bin Laden is?

SECRETARY POWELL: I do not know whether he is alive or dead.

It was the United States that went to the United Nations last September and presented the case and said to the United Nations, here's a dictator, here's a regime that for 12 years has been ignoring this international body, and what are we going to do about it? And, we worked for seven weeks. We passed a resolution supported by the Russian Federation, 15 to 0. And, everybody said they're guilty. That's what the resolution said. Iraq has been doing this. Now they have to come clean. And, if they don't come clean, and if they don't show the inspectors everything they have then serious consequences must fall. Everybody agreed to that. 15-0. We then had a serious debate as to whether or not they were really cooperating. And we could not resolve that disagreement. Some said give the inspectors more time. The United States and a number of other nations said no. All they are doing is trying to stretch it out and make sure that nothing happens. And so, they are using the United Nations against itself and we did not believe that that could continue. So we used the authority of that Resolution 1441 and earlier UN resolutions to undertake military action.

QUESTION: Secretary. There is a strategic problem now. Because the United States, the West, NATO, and Russia as well in a certain sense have two fronts. Afghanistan and Iraq. There is a threat that -- or danger, if you want -- that Afghanistan is going to be forgotten because Iraq is going to draw more and more resources and needs and Afghanistan will remain overlooked. We know that it is an enormous drug production place and that this narco money is sponsoring international terrorism. So, how to solve this?

SECRETARY POWELL: I'm not aware of the Afghan government in any way sponsoring international terrorism. .

INTERVIEWER: No, no.

SECRETARY POWELL: I do know that we have a drug crop problem in Afghanistan.

INTERVIEWER: That's right.

SECRETARY POWELL: And we are working on that. We are trying to find crop substitution measures that we can use to convince Afghan farmers that they ought to invest in something that benefits their country and not grow a crop where all the money flows out of the country. So, it is a major problem and I recognize that. But, we haven't forgotten Afghanistan. There are still American soldiers in Afghanistan. NATO is now getting ready to send a force into Afghanistan and a headquarters into Afghanistan. We're putting hundreds of millions of dollars into Afghanistan. One of the last things I did before leaving Washington to come on this trip, was to meet with our assistance officials to make sure that the construction of the road, a major road that will connect all the major cities, that the paving of that road, the construction of that road is well underway. So, I spend time during my week on Afghanistan, on Iraq, on relations with the Russian Federation and all the other many challenges that face a Secretary of State. So we have not forgotten Afghanistan. We took on a responsibility to help Afghans build a new society, and we are meeting that responsibility. We help put in place a democratic government, women are now back in the workplace, in education, in the health care system. We're building hospitals, we're building schools, we're building a new army that will protect the nation from the warlords, and from outside influence. We are able to do that and at the same time deal with our responsibilities in Iraq. We picked up the same kind of responsibilities when we conducted our military operation in Iraq, and we knew the challenges we would be facing. It's been difficult. We have a lot more work to do with respect to security, stability, rebuilding the infrastructure. But, we understand the challenge and we will meet the challenge as we have in the past.

QUESTION: So, Mr. Secretary, the United States, according to interviews that you gave in the recent past is taking a new responsibility, the Middle East crisis, the Palestinian and Israeli crisis, and you said that its President Bush's priority now, and the roadmap is the road to peace as outlined. Given that the Palestinian side seems to be accepting, at least the new Prime Minister, seems to be accepting the roadmap. On the Israeli side you have conditions and resistance. How far is the United States ready to go to force this peace - this road to peace - on Israel?

SECRETARY POWELL: You can't enforce something on a democratic nation. What we can do is try to create conditions where both sides see it is in their interest to come together and follow a particular path to peace. We have had very candid conversations with the Palestinian side and with the Israeli side this week. We hope that a meeting will be coming up soon between the Israeli side and the Palestinian side. Mr. Sharon will be coming to Washington in the next few days in order to discuss these issues with President Bush. And so this is the beginning of the process. There are strong feelings on both sides. What makes this situation new is that we have an elected Prime Minister of the Palestinian people, not Mr. Arafat, who was not an effective leader. He may still be seen as the leader of his country, but he did not lead his country toward peace or toward a Palestinian state. We now have a Prime Minister with authority, Abu Mazen. And President Bush has been waiting for a responsible interlocutor and Prime Minister Sharon ahs been waiting for a responsible interlocutor. So, we will find a way forward. President Bush is determined to find a way forward.

QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, you said that Yassir Arafat is not anymore a leader, that you don't consider him a leader. He is not a partner for peace. You said in previous interviews. Now, is that position of the United States shared by say President Putin? Does he agree with you that Arafat is no more somebody you can have, you can deal with?

SECRETARY POWELL: No, I would not presume to speak for President Putin And he can speak for himself . I know that he -- as we -- recognize that Yassir Arafat is the elected president of his people and his people look to him as their leader. What I was saying, what we have said previously, is that he is a failed leader, in that for all these years, that he has been the head of the PLO and the head of the Palestinian people, the leader of the Palestinian people, he has not brought them closer to peace, he has not brought them closer to their dream, which is a Palestinian state. And so we felt strongly that new leadership had to emerge and we now are seeing that new leadership emerge. Not because the United States put in that new leadership but because the Palestinian people through their legislature decided that they needed new leadership and so they created the position of Prime Minister. Not the United States. They brought forth Abu Mazen, named by Mr. Arafat and approved by the Palestinian legislature to be their Prime Minister, and to be given authority as Prime Minister to begin discussions with the Israeli side and with the American side so that we could find a way to move forward to the goal that we all have, and that's a Palestinian state living side by side in peace with Israel.

QUESTION: In Moscow, among the very influential politicians, there is a view that the Quartet, which is working in the Middle East, is a very effective way of solving complicated situations. Now, if you don't say agree on something, like the figure of Arafat, is it not going to make it one plus three instead of four?

SECRETARY POWELL: No. The Quartet agreed on the roadmap. Each member of the quartet has a different view with respect to Chairman Arafat, but the Quartet agreed on the roadmap. We are trying to use the roadmap as a way for Palestinian leaders to emerge and to represent the interests of their people. You can have more than one leader in a movement or in a government. We feel strongly that we have seen Mr. Arafat's leadership over the years. And, I personally have worked with Mr. Arafat for a year and a half before we formed the Quartet. And, frankly, he was not getting the job done or needed to move the peace process along and get closer to the day when the Palestinian people would have a state of their own. The Russian Federation has a different view. The UN, a different view. The European Union, a different view. I respect their views. But, where we found common cause, was the creation of a roadmap that shows the way forward to these two states. One state and one state to be -- the state of Israel and hopefully, a Palestinian state which will emerge -- and they can live side by side in peace. Thank you very much.

INTERVIEWER: Thank you very much.

Colin Powell,20030601,Interview with Barry Schweid and George Gedda of Associated Press,"(9:25 a.m. EDT) 
MR. SCHWEID: 9/11, an anniversary at hand again. Is America safer now, do you think, than it has been? 
SECRETARY POWELL: 9/11 was a great tragedy for our nation. It was a great tragedy for the world. I am pleased to say that we have not seen another incident, anything like 9/11. We've not been struck by terrorists since 9/11, so certainly the last three years have been an indication that we are safer. 
But we are still in a threatening environment. There are still people who want to strike the United States. As a result of the President's effort and his leadership, we have put in place a Homeland Security Department, we have tightened up our borders, we have a better idea who's coming into the country. We know how to use the information that we get to raise alert levels and take other precautions that protect our nation. 
And so, in that regard, we are safer, I believe. We are also safer in that we have eliminated the Taliban as a functioning group in Afghanistan. We have a government that is getting ready for presidential elections in Afghanistan coming up on the 9th of October. And al-Qaida no longer finds safe haven in that part of the world. Iraq has seen a dictator removed and it is no longer a source of that kind of activity, even though we still have challenges there. So, in that sense, I think we are safer. 
At the same time, the world has to continue to fight terrorism. We see terrorism in places like Beslan in Russia. We see what happened in Jakarta the other day, a bomb against the Australian Embassy. So while I think the nation clearly is safer, we have to remain vigilant and we have to realize that there are people out there who mean us ill, and they have to be fought and they have to be defeated. 
MR. SCHWEID: It's obviously a worldwide problem, but is -- many, many years ago, and she was virtually laughed at by think-tankers, Claire Sterling wrote many, many years ago about the notion of a network of terrorists, that it really is -- that they're interlocked, they're interlaced. Do you -- 
SECRETARY POWELL: Some clearly are interlocked. I mean, al-Qaida is a worldwide organization and JI is active in Asia and other parts of the world. What we want to make sure is that they don't become any more interlocked than they might be now. And that's why we focus not only just on military action and police action, but law enforcement, financial activities, getting into their information networks, their financial network, computer networks. Any means by which they might connect with one another, we are after to make sure that it doesn't become that kind of worldwide network. 
MR. SCHWEID: What are they after, besides chaos and hurting people? 
SECRETARY POWELL: They are after, first and foremost, making a statement through the destruction and killing of innocent people. And they have abandoned civilized means of making your opinion known. They reject democracy, they reject openness and they resort to the killing of innocent people. 
There can be no justification for what happened in Russia the other day, last week, where young students on the their first day of school, showing up with flowers and pencil boxes to learn, suddenly are put at risk and then are killed by the hundreds. There's no excuse for that. There can be no political justification. There is no religious justification. This is evil and terror staring us right in the face and it's the kind of evil and terror that we saw perpetrated against us three years ago on 9/11. And it must be fought. It must be resisted. There can be no compromise in this battle. 
MR. GEDDA: Bin Laden's face has not been seen on television since 2001. I don't know whether you would attach any significance to that. You have no inkling as to why almost three years have passed since he has appeared? 
SECRETARY POWELL: No, I don't know why. I don't know where he is and I don't know his state of health. I don't know. We believe he is still alive. I can't prove that. But he clearly is hiding as best he can. He is on the run. He is not popping up on television and he is not showing himself in a way that he could be captured. The whole world is after him for being a criminal and for being a terrorist and for being a murderer, so he is doing everything he can to stay hidden. 
MR. GEDDA: How much of a difference would his death or capture make? 
SECRETARY POWELL: I don't know. We have done a great deal of damage to the al-Qaida network. A large percentage of the senior leadership of al-Qaida has been killed or captured. But it does have the capacity to regenerate itself at lower levels, but they are not as accomplished and experienced as those who have been taken out. 
If he were to be taken out, would that destroy al-Qaida? I think it would be a very, very serious blow against al-Qaida. I cannot tell you, though, that there would not be others who would try to take his place. But the top leadership of al-Qaida has been very badly damaged through capture and death over the last three years. 
MR. GEDDA: You mentioned Russia. They have taken exception to some things that have been said from this building. Mr. Lavrov said, ""We solve our internal problems ourselves and there's no need to search for an American route to political normalization in Chechnya."" 
SECRETARY POWELL: Well, we didn't suggest any American route to political normalization of Chechnya. I think the Russians are concerned that a Chechen was able to gain asylum here through our judicial system some years back, and Mr. Lavrov made a specific reference to that individual and another individual who was able, through the judicial system in the United Kingdom, to gain asylum. But that's part of our judicial system. 
We are fully united and standing alongside the Russians as they deal with the terrorist threat that they face and the terrorist strike that was perpetrated against their innocent citizens last week. And that's what they also heard clearly enunciated by the State Department and there's no confusion here. 
How this problem of Chechnya will ultimately be solved is something for the Russians to work out, but with respect to terrorist attacks against innocent Russians, we stand united with the Russians that they have to deal with this in the most powerful, direct, forceful way that they can in order to protect their citizens, the same as we are doing to protect our citizens. 
MR. SCHWEID: Do we know yet who was involved, whether it was Chechen, all Chechen, al-Qaida? 
SECRETARY POWELL: No, I don't, and that's something we really should let the Russians determine and make appropriate announcements about. 
MR. SCHWEID: Can I ask you about Korea? The South Korean -- the disclosures about South Korean experiments and even traces of plutonium from 20 years ago. Is this going to make your job of getting North Korea to cooperate even harder? 
SECRETARY POWELL: Well, I think the North Koreans will seize on it, they have seized on it, but it's pretty obvious that these were not significant events. One took place 20 years ago of an experimental nature, the one dealing with plutonium. The one dealing with uranium happened about four years ago. But it's quite clear that these were not intended other than for academic, experimental purposes, and it's over with and I think that's, frankly, the end of the matter. I don't see any great significance to them, but the North Koreans always like to seize on anything to make their point. 
MR. SCHWEID: You still haven't -- not that you actually have to announce a date this early in September, but we don't hear a date for the resumption. 
SECRETARY POWELL: We don't have a date yet. Assistant Secretary Kelly is in the region consulting with our friends in the region, and we will see whether a date emerges from these consultations. 
We have laid out a very strong position, a very flexible position, a position that makes it clear we have no intention of invading or attacking North Korea, we have no hostile intent. But we do insist, as do the other members of the six-party group that we have put together, we do insist that we move toward the denuclearization of the peninsula in a very, very complete and verifiable way. 
The North Koreans understand that this has to be the case, and the Japanese and South Koreans have offered initial incentives in the form of energy assistance to the North Koreans to get started on this process. We are interested in participating in the writing of a security agreement that the North Koreans can see as evidence of our policy and we are waiting for the North Koreans to respond to this. North Korea is a country in need. The President has, many times, expressed his concern about the North Korean people. And, hopefully, the North Koreans will understand that there is no point in waiting or stretching this out; let's get started. 
MR. GEDDA: Iraq question. You talked to the Saudis, I don't know, six weeks ago, about their idea for a Muslim security force for Iraq. Where does that stand now? 
SECRETARY POWELL: I haven't had any recent conversations with the Saudi Foreign Minister about it. I know that they have continued to consult with different Muslim countries, but I haven't talked to him recently about what progress he has made. 
MR. GEDDA: You were enthusiastic about the Future of Iraq project two years ago. Almost nothing has been heard about it since then, and -- but you praised it at the time, you thought it was a good idea for the postwar reconstruction. 
I hear it's gathering dust, the outcome of this. Are you disappointed in that it never seemed to be acted upon after the war? 
SECRETARY POWELL: Well, the Future of Iraq study was a one-year effort led by the State Department, but it was an interagency effort. And we also brought in outsiders from think tanks, from universities and elsewhere, and it was a very good piece of work. It was made available to the Coalition Provisional Authority. It was made available to Mr. Jay Garner, General Jay Garner, before that. Parts of it have been used and that body of information is here. We're using it. 
As you know, we have an office within our Near Eastern Bureau that is working closely with Ambassador Negroponte and many of the people in that office worked on the Future of Iraq study. So it still gives us insight as to things that have to be done with respect to reconstruction, with respect to the political process, and materials are available, both to the office here as well as to Ambassador Negroponte. 
MR. SCHWEID: In Israel, the Foreign Minister is speaking of the time may be growing near to exile Arafat. I suppose that's an Israeli decision. But would that, in any way, help the situation? 
SECRETARY POWELL: Well, I haven't heard that particular report. From time to time, you receive -- you hear statements from Israeli authorities as to what the future of Mr. Arafat should be or not be, and other statements come along a few days later. So I don't have any comment at this point. I hadn't heard about it. 
MR. SCHWEID: Okay. Is there time left for you to have any impact on the stalemate, do you think? 
SECRETARY POWELL: I and members of my Department and the President have stood ready, and members of the National Security Council have stood ready, to engage with the Israelis and the Palestinians at any time such an engagement would be appropriate and would make sense. We're working with the Israelis on the Gaza disengagement plan and the four settlements that would also be removed from the West Bank and other aspects of their settlement policy. 
But what we need and what we don't have and what we have been struggling to obtain for the last year, since the President took the bold step of going to Aqaba and endorsing the roadmap and having everyone else endorse the roadmap, is the reform that's needed in the Palestinian Authority. We need to see the end of terror. We need to see the consolidation of Palestinian security forces under responsible leadership. 
We need to have an empowered prime minister, and that requires taking authority and power away from Mr. Arafat and empowering a prime minister so he could act as head of government and get on with the process of reforming the administration of the Palestinian Authority, putting in place a solid security organization and getting ready for the Gaza disengagement. 
MR. SCHWEID: That would seem to be part of any settlement -- necessary for any settlement. But is it necessary in order -- is it a prerequisite for the U.S. launching another drive? In other words, can you -- I know you're working on it -- but can you step up the drive even when the Palestinians are resisting? 
SECRETARY POWELL: We've stepped up the drive repeatedly. We've stepped up the drive at the beginning of this Administration with the Mitchell Plan, the Tenet Plan, the Zinni Plan, multiple trips. In June of 2002, the President laid out a strong vision for a Palestinian state in a way that no president has done previously, but the President noted we needed a partner to work on this, and the partner had to be somebody besides Yasser Arafat. 
We needed an empowered prime minister. We thought that we had made progress with that last year when the President went to Aqaba. And, frankly, most of that was undercut by Mr. Arafat. And so it's difficult to see how progress can be made without an empowered prime minister of the Palestinian Authority. But we stand ready. We are in touch with the parties. Assistant Secretary Burns goes there frequently. I am in touch with both sides on a regular basis. But we need to see -- we need to see movement. We just can't go moving back and forth, working with the same arrangement that has failed so many times in the past. 
A good friend of mine, who worked on this for 12 years, Mr. Dennis Ross, has just written a book that makes the same point, that Mr. Arafat is not acting as a responsible partner for peace. And it is in the interest of the Palestinian people not to eliminate Mr. Arafat, but to empower a prime minister who can be a responsible partner for peace. 
MR. SCHWEID: Yeah, he and Albright are going to hold forth on this subject at noon, by the way. 
A quick question: Can the U.S. have good relations with Venezuela under Chavez? Is it possible? 
SECRETARY POWELL: Well, we will have to see. We have concerns about some of the actions that President Chavez has taken over the years in pursuit of his vision of Bolivarian democracy. We want the Venezuelan people to do well. We are friends to the Venezuelan people. And now that the election, or the referendum, is over, we will just have to see how things develop. 
MR. SCHWEID: Toward the end of an interview, there is always a bit of a hooker, but I hope you won't take it that way. Four years are drawing to a close. Have you felt that you had a role that was, as a lot of people see you as having, of being a moderating influence in an otherwise far more conservative, far more aggressive -- I can pick the words without looking for a word that isn't terribly charged -- but I think you know what my point is. 
I talk to so many people who speak favorably, very favorably of you, and thank heavens that you're there, but they speak in terms of you having a stabilizing interest: going to the UN on Iraq and so many instances and positions you've taken on family planning, on, you know, quotas, on this affirmative action. Do you -- it's an awkward question, but I wonder if you want to deal with it at this point. 
SECRETARY POWELL: Well, I have been given many labels in the course of my career and over the past four years. The only label that really sticks and is important is that I serve this nation and I serve the President. And my job is to help the President carry out his foreign policy objectives as he determines them to be. 
And I believe he appreciates the advice I give. We have done a lot that, perhaps, doesn't get enough attention: the creation of the Millennium Challenge Corporation; the HIV/AIDS initiative; we were playing a -- played an instrumental role in creating the best relationship we've had with China in decades; a good relationship with Russia; expansion of NATO; working with the European Union to expand it and to work with the European Union to the point where it can take over some responsibilities from NATO in Europe. 
I think we played a very instrumental role in helping the Indians and Pakistanis to begin talking to one another again. We have excellent relations with both of those countries and that's not where we started out a few years ago. 
We have done a great deal with respect to free trade, open trade, expansion of the African Growth and Opportunity Act, expansion of regional trade agreements here, WTO accession. So I think we've done a great deal that is positive. 
And we also did some things that people view as controversial, but I think they are positive. Two despotic regimes are gone, the one that was in Kabul and the one that was in Baghdad, and the world is better off for their departure, and their nations are better off for the departure of these two regimes. 
We have challenging times ahead of us in order to consolidate our success there, to get rid of the insurgents both in Iraq and Afghanistan. But, in a few weeks' time, 20-odd million Afghans will have the opportunity of picking a new president in a democratic election. Imagine that, from just three years ago when the Taliban was in charge. And we are trying to accomplish the same mission for the people of Iraq, 25 million people in Iraq. 
And the people who are trying to stop it -- stop the Iraqis, stop the Iraqi Government -- are left over from the past. They're terrorists, former regime elements that want to take Iraq back into the days of Saddam Hussein. And we will not let that happen. But, more importantly, I don't think the Iraqi people will let it happen. And so we're building up Iraqi forces to deal with that challenge just as we're building up Afghan forces to deal with the insurgency that still is, to an extent, slowing down the work in Afghanistan. 
And guess what. People are turning out. They want to be part of this force. They want their country to move forward in this way. They don't want ex-Taliban or remnants of the Taliban or remnants of the former regime in Iraq to stop their progress. 
MR. GEDDA: The President said in Philadelphia the other day he'd be happy to have you around beyond January 20th, assuming he's reelected. Do you have any reaction to that? 
SECRETARY POWELL: Well, the President and I have a very strong, solid relationship and I'm pleased he would say such a thing, but you know my standard answer to this question: I serve at the pleasure. 
MR. GEDDA: Well, it seems like it is his pleasure. 
SECRETARY POWELL: Time will tell. We will see. There's no -- I don't serve a term. (Laughter.) 
MR. GEDDA: How are we doing? One more? 
MR. SCHWEID: One more quick one. Is there an area -- it would be the case, I suppose, with everybody -- is there an area -- you've dealt now heavily with what's going on in Sudan. Is there an area, is there an issue, is there a subject, in retrospect, you wished you had more time to focus on, perhaps couldn't because of other events? But is there -- the world ""regret"" comes to mind. I don't quite mean it that way. But is there something you wish you had had a little more time to deal with? 
SECRETARY POWELL: Well, I still have time, Barry. (Laughter.) 
MR. SCHWEID: Well, I know. We're not saying goodbye. We're not saying goodbye.SECRETARY POWELL: Look, we have done so many things. What I've found in this job is that thereis no area you can ignore. It all comes to my office. And so some days it will be a major issue like Iraq or Sudan. The next day, it might just be flying to Greenland to sign a modest agreement or going to a Panamanian inauguration to show support for Panama. Not momentous actions on any grand scale, but part of the job of being Secretary of State. 
So there is no issue I can't get involved in and I do get involved in. And the style that I have and the way the Department runs is, if it's somebody else's problem, then it's our problem. If somebody brings a problem to us because the United States can help with it, then we have a responsibility to help with it. 
And we've been successful in a number of areas. We've dealt with Libya and disarmed it from its weapons of mass destruction. We played a very important role in Liberia, in helping it get rid of Charles Taylor. We did the same thing in Haiti, and now we are working to build up the UN force in Haiti so that the Haitian people have a better shot at a brighter future. 
And so, sure, I always wish I had more time for the whole agenda, but we ignore no part of our agenda. 
MR. SCHWEID: Thank you. 
MR. GEDDA: Thanks. Appreciate it.

MR. SCHWEID: 9/11, an anniversary at hand again. Is America safer now, do you think, than it has been?

SECRETARY POWELL: 9/11 was a great tragedy for our nation. It was a great tragedy for the world. I am pleased to say that we have not seen another incident, anything like 9/11. We've not been struck by terrorists since 9/11, so certainly the last three years have been an indication that we are safer.

But we are still in a threatening environment. There are still people who want to strike the United States. As a result of the President's effort and his leadership, we have put in place a Homeland Security Department, we have tightened up our borders, we have a better idea who's coming into the country. We know how to use the information that we get to raise alert levels and take other precautions that protect our nation.

And so, in that regard, we are safer, I believe. We are also safer in that we have eliminated the Taliban as a functioning group in Afghanistan. We have a government that is getting ready for presidential elections in Afghanistan coming up on the 9th of October. And al-Qaida no longer finds safe haven in that part of the world. Iraq has seen a dictator removed and it is no longer a source of that kind of activity, even though we still have challenges there. So, in that sense, I think we are safer.

At the same time, the world has to continue to fight terrorism. We see terrorism in places like Beslan in Russia. We see what happened in Jakarta the other day, a bomb against the Australian Embassy. So while I think the nation clearly is safer, we have to remain vigilant and we have to realize that there are people out there who mean us ill, and they have to be fought and they have to be defeated.

What we want to make sure is that they don't become any more interlocked than they might be now. And that's why we focus not only just on military action and police action, but law enforcement, financial activities, getting into their information networks, their financial network, computer networks. Any means by which they might connect with one another, we are after to make sure that it doesn't become that kind of worldwide network.

MR. SCHWEID: What are they after, besides chaos and hurting people?

SECRETARY POWELL: They are after, first and foremost, making a statement through the destruction and killing of innocent people. And they have abandoned civilized means of making your opinion known. They reject democracy, they reject openness and they resort to the killing of innocent people.

There can be no justification for what happened in Russia the other day, last week, where young students on the their first day of school, showing up with flowers and pencil boxes to learn, suddenly are put at risk and then are killed by the hundreds.

But it does have the capacity to regenerate itself at lower levels, but they are not as accomplished and experienced as those who have been taken out.

If he were to be taken out, would that destroy al-Qaida? I think it would be a very, very serious blow against al-Qaida. I cannot tell you, though, that there would not be others who would try to take his place. But the top leadership of al-Qaida has been very badly damaged through capture and death over the last three years.

MR. GEDDA: You mentioned Russia. They have taken exception to some things that have been said from this building. Mr. Lavrov said, ""We solve our internal problems ourselves and there's no need to search for an American route to political normalization in Chechnya.""

SECRETARY POWELL: Well, we didn't suggest any American route to political normalization of Chechnya. I think the Russians are concerned that a Chechen was able to gain asylum here through our judicial system some years back, and Mr. Lavrov made a specific reference to that individual and another individual who was able, through the judicial system in the United Kingdom, to gain asylum. But that's part of our judicial system.

We are fully united and standing alongside the Russians as they deal with the terrorist threat that they face and the terrorist strike that was perpetrated against their innocent citizens last week. And that's what they also heard clearly enunciated by the State Department and there's no confusion here.

How this problem of Chechnya will ultimately be solved is something for the Russians to work out, but with respect to terrorist attacks against innocent Russians, we stand united with the Russians that they have to deal with this in the most powerful, direct, forceful way that they can in order to protect their citizens, the same as we are doing to protect our citizens.

MR. SCHWEID: Do we know yet who was involved, whether it was Chechen, all Chechen, al-Qaida?

SECRETARY POWELL: No, I don't, and that's something we really should let the Russians determine and make appropriate announcements about.

MR. SCHWEID: Can I ask you about Korea? The South Korean -- the disclosures about South Korean experiments and even traces of plutonium from 20 years ago. Is this going to make your job of getting North Korea to cooperate even harder?

SECRETARY POWELL: Well, I think the North Koreans will seize on it, they have seized on it, but it's pretty obvious that these were not significant events. One took place 20 years ago of an experimental nature, the one dealing with plutonium. The one dealing with uranium happened about four years ago. But it's quite clear that these were not intended other than for academic, experimental purposes, and it's over with and I think that's, frankly, the end of the matter. I don't see any great significance to them, but the North Koreans always like to seize on anything to make their point.

MR. SCHWEID: You still haven't -- not that you actually have to announce a date this early in September, but we don't hear a date for the resumption.

SECRETARY POWELL: We don't have a date yet. Assistant Secretary Kelly is in the region consulting with our friends in the region, and we will see whether a date emerges from these consultations.

We have laid out a very strong position, a very flexible position, a position that makes it clear we have no intention of invading or attacking North Korea, we have no hostile intent. But we do insist, as do the other members of the six-party group that we have put together, we do insist that we move toward the denuclearization of the peninsula in a very, very complete and verifiable way.

The North Koreans understand that this has to be the case, and the Japanese and South Koreans have offered initial incentives in the form of energy assistance to the North Koreans to get started on this process. We are interested in participating in the writing of a security agreement that the North Koreans can see as evidence of our policy and we are waiting for the North Koreans to respond to this. North Korea is a country in need. The President has, many times, expressed his concern about the North Korean people. And, hopefully, the North Koreans will understand that there is no point in waiting or stretching this out; let's get started.

MR. GEDDA: Iraq question. You talked to the Saudis, I don't know, six weeks ago, about their idea for a Muslim security force for Iraq. Where does that stand now?

SECRETARY POWELL: I haven't had any recent conversations with the Saudi Foreign Minister about it. I know that they have continued to consult with different Muslim countries, but I haven't talked to him recently about what progress he has made.

MR. GEDDA: You were enthusiastic about the Future of Iraq project two years ago. Almost nothing has been heard about it since then, and -- but you praised it at the time, you thought it was a good idea for the postwar reconstruction.

I hear it's gathering dust, the outcome of this. Are you disappointed in that it never seemed to be acted upon after the war?

SECRETARY POWELL: Well, the Future of Iraq study was a one-year effort led by the State Department, but it was an interagency effort. And we also brought in outsiders from think tanks, from universities and elsewhere, and it was a very good piece of work. It was made available to the Coalition Provisional Authority. It was made available to Mr. Jay Garner, General Jay Garner, before that. Parts of it have been used and that body of information is here. We're using it.

As you know, we have an office within our Near Eastern Bureau that is working closely with Ambassador Negroponte and many of the people in that office worked on the Future of Iraq study. So it still gives us insight as to things that have to be done with respect to reconstruction, with respect to the political process, and materials are available, both to the office here as well as to Ambassador Negroponte.

MR. SCHWEID: In Israel, the Foreign Minister is speaking of the time may be growing near to exile Arafat. I suppose that's an Israeli decision. But would that, in any way, help the situation?

SECRETARY POWELL: Well, I haven't heard that particular report. From time to time, you receive -- you hear statements from Israeli authorities as to what the future of Mr. Arafat should be or not be, and other statements come along a few days later. So I don't have any comment at this point. I hadn't heard about it.

MR. SCHWEID: Okay. Is there time left for you to have any impact on the stalemate, do you think?

SECRETARY POWELL: I and members of my Department and the President have stood ready, and members of the National Security Council have stood ready, to engage with the Israelis and the Palestinians at any time such an engagement would be appropriate and would make sense. We're working with the Israelis on the Gaza disengagement plan and the four settlements that would also be removed from the West Bank and other aspects of their settlement policy.

But what we need and what we don't have and what we have been struggling to obtain for the last year, since the President took the bold step of going to Aqaba and endorsing the roadmap and having everyone else endorse the roadmap, is the reform that's needed in the Palestinian Authority. We need to see the end of terror. We need to see the consolidation of Palestinian security forces under responsible leadership.

We need to have an empowered prime minister, and that requires taking authority and power away from Mr. Arafat and empowering a prime minister so he could act as head of government and get on with the process of reforming the administration of the Palestinian Authority, putting in place a solid security organization and getting ready for the Gaza disengagement.

MR. SCHWEID: That would seem to be part of any settlement -- necessary for any settlement. But is it necessary in order -- is it a prerequisite for the U.S. launching another drive? In other words, can you -- I know you're working on it -- but can you step up the drive even when the Palestinians are resisting?

SECRETARY POWELL: We've stepped up the drive repeatedly. We've stepped up the drive at the beginning of this Administration with the Mitchell Plan, the Tenet Plan, the Zinni Plan, multiple trips. In June of 2002, the President laid out a strong vision for a Palestinian state in a way that no president has done previously, but the President noted we needed a partner to work on this, and the partner had to be somebody besides Yasser Arafat.

We needed an empowered prime minister. We thought that we had made progress with that last year when the President went to Aqaba. And, frankly, most of that was undercut by Mr. Arafat. And so it's difficult to see how progress can be made without an empowered prime minister of the Palestinian Authority. But we stand ready. We are in touch with the parties. Assistant Secretary Burns goes there frequently. I am in touch with both sides on a regular basis. But we need to see -- we need to see movement. We just can't go moving back and forth, working with the same arrangement that has failed so many times in the past.

A good friend of mine, who worked on this for 12 years, Mr. Dennis Ross, has just written a book that makes the same point, that Mr. Arafat is not acting as a responsible partner for peace. And it is in the interest of the Palestinian people not to eliminate Mr. Arafat, but to empower a prime minister who can be a responsible partner for peace.

MR. SCHWEID: Yeah, he and Albright are going to hold forth on this subject at noon, by the way.

A quick question: Can the U.S. have good relations with Venezuela under Chavez? Is it possible?

SECRETARY POWELL: Well, we will have to see. We have concerns about some of the actions that President Chavez has taken over the years in pursuit of his vision of Bolivarian democracy. We want the Venezuelan people to do well. We are friends to the Venezuelan people. And now that the election, or the referendum, is over, we will just have to see how things develop.

MR. SCHWEID: Toward the end of an interview, there is always a bit of a hooker, but I hope you won't take it that way. Four years are drawing to a close. Have you felt that you had a role that was, as a lot of people see you as having, of being a moderating influence in an otherwise far more conservative, far more aggressive -- I can pick the words without looking for a word that isn't terribly charged -- but I think you know what my point is.

I talk to so many people who speak favorably, very favorably of you, and thank heavens that you're there, but they speak in terms of you having a stabilizing interest: going to the UN on Iraq and so many instances and positions you've taken on family planning, on, you know, quotas, on this affirmative action. Do you -- it's an awkward question, but I wonder if you want to deal with it at this point.

SECRETARY POWELL: Well, I have been given many labels in the course of my career and over the past four years. The only label that really sticks and is important is that I serve this nation and I serve the President. And my job is to help the President carry out his foreign policy objectives as he determines them to be.

And I believe he appreciates the advice I give. We have done a lot that, perhaps, doesn't get enough attention: the creation of the Millennium Challenge Corporation; the HIV/AIDS initiative; we were playing a -- played an instrumental role in creating the best relationship we've had with China in decades; a good relationship with Russia; expansion of NATO; working with the European Union to expand it and to work with the European Union to the point where it can take over some responsibilities from NATO in Europe.

I think we played a very instrumental role in helping the Indians and Pakistanis to begin talking to one another again. We have excellent relations with both of those countries and that's not where we started out a few years ago.

We have done a great deal with respect to free trade, open trade, expansion of the African Growth and Opportunity Act, expansion of regional trade agreements here, WTO accession. So I think we've done a great deal that is positive.

And we also did some things that people view as controversial, but I think they are positive. Two despotic regimes are gone, the one that was in Kabul and the one that was in Baghdad, and the world is better off for their departure, and their nations are better off for the departure of these two regimes.

We have challenging times ahead of us in order to consolidate our success there, to get rid of the insurgents both in Iraq and Afghanistan. But, in a few weeks' time, 20-odd million Afghans will have the opportunity of picking a new president in a democratic election. Imagine that, from just three years ago when the Taliban was in charge. And we are trying to accomplish the same mission for the people of Iraq, 25 million people in Iraq.

And the people who are trying to stop it -- stop the Iraqis, stop the Iraqi Government -- are left over from the past. They're terrorists, former regime elements that want to take Iraq back into the days of Saddam Hussein. And we will not let that happen. But, more importantly, I don't think the Iraqi people will let it happen. And so we're building up Iraqi forces to deal with that challenge just as we're building up Afghan forces to deal with the insurgency that still is, to an extent, slowing down the work in Afghanistan.

And guess what. People are turning out. They want to be part of this force. They want their country to move forward in this way. They don't want ex-Taliban or remnants of the Taliban or remnants of the former regime in Iraq to stop their progress.

MR. GEDDA: The President said in Philadelphia the other day he'd be happy to have you around beyond January 20th, assuming he's reelected. Do you have any reaction to that?

SECRETARY POWELL: Well, the President and I have a very strong, solid relationship and I'm pleased he would say such a thing, but you know my standard answer to this question: I serve at the pleasure.

MR. GEDDA: Well, it seems like it is his pleasure.

SECRETARY POWELL: Time will tell. We will see. There's no -- I don't serve a term. (Laughter.)

MR. GEDDA: How are we doing? One more?

MR. SCHWEID: One more quick one. Is there an area -- it would be the case, I suppose, with everybody -- is there an area -- you've dealt now heavily with what's going on in Sudan. Is there an area, is there an issue, is there a subject, in retrospect, you wished you had more time to focus on, perhaps couldn't because of other events? But is there -- the world ""regret"" comes to mind. I don't quite mean it that way. But is there something you wish you had had a little more time to deal with?

SECRETARY POWELL: Well, I still have time, Barry. (Laughter.)

MR. SCHWEID: Well, I know. We're not saying goodbye. We're not saying goodbye.SECRETARY POWELL: Look, we have done so many things. What I've found in this job is that thereis no area you can ignore. It all comes to my office. And so some days it will be a major issue like Iraq or Sudan. The next day, it might just be flying to Greenland to sign a modest agreement or going to a Panamanian inauguration to show support for Panama. Not momentous actions on any grand scale, but part of the job of being Secretary of State.

So there is no issue I can't get involved in and I do get involved in. And the style that I have and the way the Department runs is, if it's somebody else's problem, then it's our problem. If somebody brings a problem to us because the United States can help with it, then we have a responsibility to help with it.

And we've been successful in a number of areas. We've dealt with Libya and disarmed it from its weapons of mass destruction. We played a very important role in Liberia, in helping it get rid of Charles Taylor. We did the same thing in Haiti, and now we are working to build up the UN force in Haiti so that the Haitian people have a better shot at a brighter future.

And so, sure, I always wish I had more time for the whole agenda, but we ignore no part of our agenda.

MR. SCHWEID: Thank you.

MR. GEDDA: Thanks. Appreciate it.

Colin Powell,20020126,Interview on TV6,"QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, what is your view of the role and the actions of Russia during the current situation in Afghanistan and around Afghanistan?
SECRETARY POWELL: I think Russia has played a very positive role since the events of the 11th of September. We are very pleased at the immediate support that President Putin gave to us. He was the first world leader to call Mr. Bush and that meant a lot to the American people. The Russian people and the Russian government have been working very closely with us and with the international coalition to bring all the pressure to bear that we can against the terrorists of the September 11th incident, those who were responsible for the September 11th incident, and in the campaign against terrorism in general. Russia has suffered from terrorist acts and understands that this is a campaign that the whole of Russia should be aligned in.
QUESTION: Could you tell us what disagreements exist in the approaches to the Afghan problem between Russia and the United States?
SECRETARY POWELL: I dont know of any. Foreign Minister Ivanov and I speak several times a week on the issue. They have been very supportive of our efforts in the United Nations. We have coordinated very, very closely. We have coordinated as we tried to get the political process started in Bonn and both governments are supporting the interim administration that will be heading to Kabul shortly and we have worked together as Russia sent in some of its units to reestablish your embassy and also to put into place a humanitarian operation which is doing wonderful work. In all of that we have coordinated closely with each other.
QUESTION: Mr. Powell, could you tell us if there were any changes and, if so, what changes have occurred in the attitude of the US administration toward the actions of the Russian government in Chechnya since September 11th?
SECRETARY POWELL: We noted with great interest President Putins speech several weeks after September 11th when he aligned himself in the campaign against terrorism and also spoke about his desires to reach a political settlement in Chechnya. We welcomed that statement on his side, his statement. We have said to our Russian colleagues that we understand that they have a situation, a problem they have to deal with. There are terrorists in Chechnya and we understand that, but they have to use restraint to try to find a political solution and be very, very considerate of human rights of people and make sure they look aggressively into any instances where human rights may have been violated in the prosecution of this crisis.
QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, could you tell us how the current cases, the current events, in which the Russian government more and more often tries to suppress the media, specifically they are trying to do that to TV-6, this TV company that I represent. How would they affect the Russian-US relations?
SECRETARY POWELL: I cant speak to the specifics of your station, either on the business side or the political side, but just let me say that we have always said to our Russian colleagues that an independent media is an essential component of a democratic system. The media must be free to gather information and must be free to criticize every element of the society. It can be very uncomfortable at times - believe me I know - but this is one of the essential features of democracy: a free and independent media that is a check on all elements of society. Our two presidents discussed this at every one of their meetings and after the Washington-Crawford meetings President Bush offered to send a group of media experts over to discuss these matters with the Russian government and the media people in Russia.
QUESTION: And are you going to raise this issue during this current visit?
SECRETARY POWELL: I always raise it in my discussions with Foreign Minister Ivanov and Im sure it will come up in my discussions with President Putin.
QUESTION: Thank you, Mister Secretary, for your [inaudible].

Colin Powell,20030501,Press Conference with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov,"(As Translated)FOREIGN MINISTER IVANOV: Ladies and Gentleman, we are glad to welcome you and would like to say to you some comments, some comments following the meeting of the President of the Russian Federation and the Secretary of State of the United States. Although this has not been a lengthy meeting, nevertheless a broad range of issues have been discussed including bilateral agenda and many international problems. The discussion has been open, frank and constructive and the leitmotif of the whole discussion boils down to the statement that Russia and the United States must continue to go to pursue this path of true partnership between the two countries. And despite the difficulties and differences that we have had in the recent path concerning Iraq I must tell you that the basic foundation of our partnership relations have survived this test, have passed this test and we reaffirmed our desire and our intention to continue further development and strengthening of our partnership both on a bi-lateral basis and an international format. Very soon there will be a summit meeting between our two presidents in St. Petersburg and we are confident that this forthcoming meeting will provide a new impetus to the further development of our bi-lateral relations in all the areas and first of all in the area of strengthening security. Thank you. 
SECRETARY POWELL: Thank you very much, Mr. Minister. It was a great pleasure to be back in the Russian Federation and to have had the opportunity to meet with you and with President Putin. I am especially pleased and honored to be here on the day that the Duma voted to ratify the treaty that was entered into last year here in Moscow, which we refer to as the Treaty of Moscow, which provides for the reduction of arsenals of nuclear weapons. I certainly agree with the Ministers assessment that my meeting with President Putin was very open and candid and to the point. We talked about some of the difficulties weve had in the recent past with respect to Iraq. But we also spoke about the successes we have had with respect to the Treaty of Moscow, and to the strength of our bi-lateral relationship with delegations going back and forth, and the closest contact between our ministries and we too are looking forward to the meeting of our Presidents in St. Petersburg in just a couple of weeks time. With respect to Iraq, Minister Ivanov and I will be working closely in the days ahead on the resolution that is pending before the United Nations to see if we can come into agreement with our other security council partners in passing a resolution that we will use to help the people of Iraq build a better life for themselves and for their children. Thank you very much Mr. Minister. 
QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, do the positive statements on Iraq mean the United States and Russia now agree there should be an unambiguous lifting of sanctions, unconditional lifting of sanctions on Iraq? On Iran, there was no mention of technology transfers which has bothered the United States, and Mr. Minister, do you think the U.S. now has an understanding of what is going on in Chechnya with the rebellion it is up against?
SECRETARY POWELL: I counted 3 or 4 questions. (laughter) What was the question? With respect to Iraq, we have described our position to each other. There are some outstanding issues and we will be working on these issues in the spirit of partnership in trying to come to a solution. But I wouldnt pre-judge any particular outcome at this point. With respect to Iran we had a full discussion of our mutual concerns concerning nuclear programs, nuclear developments in Iran and I think we have a better understanding of one anothers concerns and weve come a little closer as to how we should deal with our concerns. 
FOREIGN MINISTER IVANOV: As I mentioned at the beginning, we discussed a broad range of issues both international issues and bi-lateral issues. Naturally, we didnt dwell on all of them, but nevertheless a broad range of issues have been covered including the situation in the Middle East, Afghanistan, the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and some other international issues. As regards Iraq, we decided not to focus on our past disagreements but rather to try and find common ground and achieve mutual understanding, including the matter of adopting a new resolution at the Security Council in order to unite the efforts of the entire international community and to unite the Iraqi people. And we will continue our consultations both with our American partners and with other members of the United Nations Security Council. As regards Chechnya, President Putin expressed his gratitude to the State Department of the United States for their statement, a clear-cut and firm statement condemning the recent terrorist acts in Chechnya. And these terrorists acts that have taken place recently in Saudi Arabia and in Chechnya once again demonstrate the need for pooling the efforts of the entire international community in order to counter the terrorist activities throughout the world. At the same time, let me assure you that these terrorist acts will not impede the efforts of the Russian Government in order to find a political resolution, a political settlement, of the situation in Chechnya and all the plans that we have for political settlement and resolution of the problem will be implemented. 
QUESTION: There have been reports that there have been some problems with a new United Nations Security Council resolution on Iraq, how serious are those differences and could Russia again take a similarly hard position, firm position, as it took previously when previous resolutions were discussed. 
FOREIGN MINISTER IVANOV: Now the discussions are underway on specific questions, specific issues concerning this resolution and therefore I would prefer not to single out any of those issues. The main thing now is to create a legal basis for a broad international involvement in post-war rehabilitation of the country. And this is our objective. We do not seek to somehow to complicate the resolution or somehow to create artificial barriers standing in the way of adopting a common resolution. We must find together a way out and we must find ways and means to help the Iraqi people to build a new peaceful life. And this is the concrete objective that we pursue. And we, it is our intention to continue to work along these lines in a constructive spirit. 
QUESTION: Nicholas Kralev, Washington Times: President Putin said here minutes or hours ago that the differences between you have been successfully overcome. Does that mean that, Mr. Secretary, that at some point in the process you envision a role for UNMOVIC, and that the inspectors would return to Iraq? (In Russian): Mr. Minister, is Russia prepared to recognize the leading role of the coalition in governing Iraq?
SECRETARY POWELL: I think what the President was referring to a little earlier was that the difference of agreement we had with respect to the use of force and the second resolution, that is now behind us. And as we engage on this new resolution there are many issues that have to be discussed within the Security Council and one of which has to do with UNMOVIC, but we didnt resolve that here today. 
FOREIGN MINISTER IVANOV: As I have already mentioned the resolution has a comprehensive nature and it touches upon many issues including the security issue. The way how those questions, those issues will be resolved is exactly something that we have been discussing today and intend to continue discussion. In any case, it is quite obvious, that Iraq will need international assistance in dealing with security issues. And I think that we need to find a solution that will help to resolve other issues as well, including humanitarian problems, economic rehabilitation of the country and some other issues related to the restoration of peaceful life in that country.

SECRETARY POWELL: Thank you very much, Mr. Minister. It was a great pleasure to be back in the Russian Federation and to have had the opportunity to meet with you and with President Putin. I am especially pleased and honored to be here on the day that the Duma voted to ratify the treaty that was entered into last year here in Moscow, which we refer to as the Treaty of Moscow, which provides for the reduction of arsenals of nuclear weapons.

FOREIGN MINISTER IVANOV: Now the discussions are underway on specific questions, specific issues concerning this resolution and therefore I would prefer not to single out any of those issues. The main thing now is to create a legal basis for a broad international involvement in post-war rehabilitation of the country. And this is our objective. We do not seek to somehow to complicate the resolution or somehow to create artificial barriers standing in the way of adopting a common resolution. We must find together a way out and we must find ways and means to help the Iraqi people to build a new peaceful life. And this is the concrete objective that we pursue. And we, it is our intention to continue to work along these lines in a constructive spirit.

QUESTION: Nicholas Kralev, Washington Times: President Putin said here minutes or hours ago that the differences between you have been successfully overcome. Does that mean that, Mr. Secretary, that at some point in the process you envision a role for UNMOVIC, and that the inspectors would return to Iraq? (In Russian): Mr. Minister, is Russia prepared to recognize the leading role of the coalition in governing Iraq?

SECRETARY POWELL: I think what the President was referring to a little earlier was that the difference of agreement we had with respect to the use of force and the second resolution, that is now behind us. And as we engage on this new resolution there are many issues that have to be discussed within the Security Council and one of which has to do with UNMOVIC, but we didnt resolve that here today.

FOREIGN MINISTER IVANOV: As I have already mentioned the resolution has a comprehensive nature and it touches upon many issues including the security issue. The way how those questions, those issues will be resolved is exactly something that we have been discussing today and intend to continue discussion. In any case, it is quite obvious, that Iraq will need international assistance in dealing with security issues. And I think that we need to find a solution that will help to resolve other issues as well, including humanitarian problems, economic rehabilitation of the country and some other issues related to the restoration of peaceful life in that country.

Colin Powell,20030709,Remarks to the United Nations Security Council,"[full video; accompanying slide presentations and video clips]
SECRETARY POWELL: Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President and Mr. Secretary General, distinguished colleagues, I would like to begin by expressing my thanks for the special effort that each of you made to be here today. This is an important day for us all as we review the situation with respect to Iraq and its disarmament obligations under UN Security Council Resolution 1441.
Last November 8, this Council passed Resolution 1441 by a unanimous vote. The purpose of that resolution was to disarm Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction. Iraq had already been found guilty of material breach of its obligations stretching back over 16 previous resolutions and 12 years.

Resolution 1441 was not dealing with an innocent party, but a regime this Council has repeatedly convicted over the years.
Resolution 1441 gave Iraq one last chance, one last chance to come into compliance or to face serious consequences. No Council member present and voting on that day had any illusions about the nature and intent of the resolution or what serious consequences meant if Iraq did not comply.
And to assist in its disarmament, we called on Iraq to cooperate with returning inspectors from UNMOVIC and IAEA. We laid down tough standards for Iraq to meet to allow the inspectors to do their job.

This Council placed the burden on Iraq to comply and disarm, and not on the inspectors to find that which Iraq has gone out of its way to conceal for so long. Inspectors are inspectors; they are not detectives.
I asked for this session today for two purposes. First, to support the core assessments made by Dr. Blix and Dr. ElBaradei. As Dr. Blix reported to this Council on January 27, ""Iraq appears not to have come to a genuine acceptance, not even today, of the disarmament which was demanded of it.""
And as Dr. ElBaradei reported, Iraq's declaration of December 7 ""did not provide any new information relevant to certain questions that have been outstanding since 1998.""
My second purpose today is to provide you with additional information, to share with you what the United States knows about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, as well as Iraq's involvement in terrorism, which is also the subject of Resolution 1441 and other earlier resolutions.
I might add at this point that we are providing all relevant information we can to the inspection teams for them to do their work.
The material I will present to you comes from a variety of sources. Some are U.S. sources and some are those of other countries. Some are the sources are technical, such as intercepted telephone conversations and photos taken by satellites. Other sources are people who have risked their lives to let the world know what Saddam Hussein is really up to.
I cannot tell you everything that we know, but what I can share with you, when combined with what all of us have learned over the years, is deeply troubling. What you will see is an accumulation of facts and disturbing patterns of behavior. The facts and Iraqis' behavior, Iraq's behavior, demonstrate that Saddam Hussein and his regime have made no effort, no effort, to disarm, as required by the international community.
Indeed, the facts and Iraq's behavior show that Saddam Hussein and his regime are concealing their efforts to produce more weapons of mass destruction.
Let me begin by playing a tape for you. What you’re about to hear is a conversation that my government monitored. It takes place on November 26th of last year, on the day before United Nations teams resumed inspections in Iraq. The conversation involves two senior officers, a colonel and a brigadier general from Iraq's elite military unit, the Republican Guard.
[The tape is played.] AUDIO
 
SECRETARY POWELL: Let me pause and review some of the key elements of this conversation that you just heard between these two officers.
First, they acknowledge that our colleague, Mohammed ElBaradei is coming, and they know what he's coming for and they know he's coming the next day. He's coming to look for things that are prohibited. He is expecting these gentlemen to cooperate with him and not hide things.
But they're worried. We have this modified vehicle. What do we say if one of them sees it? What is their concern? Their concern is that it's something they should not have, something that should not be seen.
The general was incredulous: ""You didn't get it modified. You don't have one of those, do you?""

""I have one.""
""Which? From where?""
""From the workshop. From the Al-Kindi Company.""
""What?""
""From Al-Kindi.""
""I'll come to see you in the morning. I'm worried you all have something left.""

""We evacuated everything. We don't have anything left.""
Note what he says: ""We evacuated everything."" We didn't destroy it. We didn't line it up for inspection. We didn't turn it into the inspectors. We evacuated it to make sure it was not around when the inspectors showed up. ""I will come to you tomorrow.""
The Al-Kindi Company. This is a company that is well known to have been involved in prohibited weapons systems activity.
Let me play another tape for you. As you will recall, the inspectors found 12 empty chemical warheads on January 16th. On January 20th, four days later, Iraq promised the inspectors it would search for more. You will now hear an officer from Republican Guard headquarters issuing an instruction to an officer in the field. Their conversation took place just last week, on January 30.
[The tape was played.] AUDIO
SECRETARY POWELL: Let me pause again and review the elements of this message.

""They are inspecting the ammunition you have, yes?""
""Yes. For the possibility there are forbidden ammo.""
""For the possibility there is, by chance, forbidden ammo?""

""Yes.
""And we sent you a message yesterday to clean out all the areas, the scrap areas, the abandoned areas. Make sure there is nothing there. Remember the first message: evacuate it.""
This is all part of a system of hiding things and moving things out of the way and making sure they have left nothing behind.

You go a little further into this message and you see the specific instructions from headquarters: ""After you have carried out what is contained in this message, destroy the message because I don't want anyone to see this message.""
""Okay.""
""Okay.""
Why? Why? This message would have verified to the inspectors that they have been trying to turn over things. They were looking for things, but they don't want that message seen because they were trying to clean up the area, to leave no evidence behind of the presence of weapons of mass destruction. And they can claim that nothing was there and the inspectors can look all they want and they will find nothing.
This effort to hide things from the inspectors is not one or two isolated events. Quite the contrary, this is part and parcel of a policy of evasion and deception that goes back 12 years, a policy set at the highest levels of the Iraqi regime.
We know that Saddam Hussein has what is called ""a Higher Committee for Monitoring the Inspection Teams."" Think about that. Iraq has a high-level committee to monitor the inspectors who were sent in to monitor Iraq's disarmament -- not to cooperate with them, not to assist them, but to spy on them and keep them from doing their jobs.
The committee reports directly to Saddam Hussein. It is headed by Iraq's Vice President, Taha Yasin Ramadan. Its members include Saddam Hussein's son, Qusay.
This committee also includes Lieutenant General Amir al-Sa'di, an advisor to Saddam. In case that name isn't immediately familiar to you, General Sa'di has been the Iraqi regime's primary point of contact for Dr. Blix and Dr. ElBaradei. It was General Sa'di who last fall publicly pledged that Iraq was prepared to cooperate unconditionally with inspectors. Quite the contrary, Sa'di's job is not to cooperate; it is to deceive, not to disarm, but to undermine the inspectors; not to support them, but to frustrate them and to make sure they learn nothing.
We have learned a lot about the work of this special committee. We learned that just prior to the return of inspectors last November, the regime had decided to resume what we heard called ""the old game of cat-and-mouse.""
For example, let me focus on the now famous declaration that Iraq submitted to this Council on December 7th. Iraq never had any intention of complying with this Council's mandate. Instead, Iraq planned to use the declaration to overwhelm us and to overwhelm the inspectors with useless information about Iraq's permitted weapons so that we would not have time to pursue Iraq's prohibited weapons. Iraq's goal was to give us in this room, to give those of us on this Council, the false impression that the inspection process was working.
You saw the result. Dr. Blix pronounced the 12,200-page declaration ""rich in volume"" but ""poor in information and practically devoid of new evidence."" Could any member of this Council honestly rise in defense of this false declaration?
Everything we have seen and heard indicates that instead of cooperating actively with the inspectors to ensure the success of their mission, Saddam Hussein and his regime are busy doing all they possibly can to ensure that inspectors succeed in finding absolutely nothing.
My colleagues, every statement I make today is backed up by sources, solid sources. These are not assertions. What we are giving you are facts and conclusions based on solid intelligence. I will cite some examples, and these are from human sources.
Orders were issued to Iraq's security organizations, as well as to Saddam Hussein's own office, to hide all correspondence with the Organization of Military Industrialization. This is the organization that oversees Iraq's weapons of mass destruction activities. Make sure there are no documents left which would connect you to the OMI.
We know that Saddam's son, Qusay, ordered the removal of all prohibited weapons from Saddam's numerous palace complexes. We know that Iraqi government officials, members of the ruling Ba'ath Party and scientists have hidden prohibited items in their homes. Other key files from military and scientific establishments have been placed in cars that are being driven around the countryside by Iraqi intelligence agents to avoid detection.

Thanks to intelligence they were provided, the inspectors recently found dramatic confirmation of these reports. When they searched the homes of an Iraqi nuclear scientist, they uncovered roughly 2,000 pages of documents. You see them here being brought out of the home and placed in UN hands. Some of the material is classified and related to Iraq's nuclear program.
Tell me, answer me: Are the inspectors to search the house of every government official, every Ba'ath Party member and every scientist in the country to find the truth, to get the information they need to satisfy the demands of our Council?
Our sources tell us that in some cases the hard drives of computers at Iraqi weapons facilities were replaced. Who took the hard drives? Where did they go? What is being hidden? Why?
There is only one answer to the why: to deceive, to hide, to keep from the inspectors.
Numerous human sources tell us that the Iraqis are moving not just documents and hard drives, but weapons of mass destruction, to keep them from being found by inspectors. While we were here in this Council chamber debating Resolution 1441 last fall, we know, we know from sources that a missile brigade outside Baghdad was dispersing rocket launchers and warheads containing biological warfare agent to various locations, distributing them to various locations in western Iraq.
Most of the launchers and warheads had been hidden in large groves of palm trees and were to be moved every one to four weeks to escape detection.
We also have satellite photos that indicate that banned materials have recently been moved from a number of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction facilities.
Let me say a word about satellite images before I show a couple. The photos that I am about to show you are sometimes hard for the average person to interpret, hard for me. The painstaking work of photo analysis takes experts with years and years of experience, poring for hours and hours over light tables. But as I show you these images, I will try to capture and explain what they mean, what they indicate, to our imagery specialists.

Let's look at one. This one is about a weapons munition facility, a facility that holds ammunition at a place called Taji. This is one of about 65 such facilities in Iraq. We know that this one has housed chemical munitions. In fact, this is where the Iraqis recently came up with the additional four chemical weapons shells.
Here you see 15 munitions bunkers in yellow and red outlines. The four that are in red squares represent active chemical munitions bunkers.

How do I know that? How can I say that? Let me give you a closer look. Look at the image on the left. On the left is a close-up of one of the four chemical bunkers. The two arrows indicate the presence of sure signs that the bunkers are storing chemical munitions. The arrow at the top that says ""security"" points to a facility that is a signature item for this kind of bunker. Inside that facility are special guards and special equipment to monitor any leakage that might come out of the bunker. The truck you also see is a signature item. It's a decontamination vehicle in case something goes wrong. This is characteristic of those four bunkers. The special security facility and the decontamination vehicle will be in the area, if not at any one of them or one of the other, it is moving around those four and it moves as needed to move as people are working in the different bunkers.
Now look at the picture on the right. You are now looking at two of those sanitized bunkers. The signature vehicles are gone, the tents are gone. It's been cleaned up. And it was done on the 22nd of December as the UN inspection team is arriving, and you can see the inspection vehicles arriving in the lower portion of the picture on the right.
The bunkers are clean when the inspectors get there. They found nothing.
This sequence of events raises the worrisome suspicion that Iraq had been tipped off to the forthcoming inspections at Taji. As it did throughout the 1990s, we know that Iraq today is actively using its considerable intelligence capabilities to hide its illicit activities. From our sources, we know that inspectors are under constant surveillance by an army of Iraqi intelligence operatives. Iraq is relentlessly attempting to tap all of their communications, both voice and electronics. I would call my colleagues' attention to the fine paper that the United Kingdom distributed yesterday which describes in exquisite detail Iraqi deception activities.

In this next example, you will see the type of concealment activity Iraq has undertaken in response to the resumption of inspections. Indeed, in November of 2002, just when the inspections were about to resume, this type of activity spiked. Here are three examples.

At this ballistic missile site on November 10th, we saw a cargo truck preparing to move ballistic missile components.
At this biological weapons-related facility on November 25th, just two days before inspections resumed, this truck caravan appeared -- something we almost never see at this facility and we monitor it carefully and regularly.

At this ballistic missile facility, again, two days before inspections began, five large cargo trucks appeared, along with a truck-mounted crane, to move missiles.
We saw this kind of housecleaning at close to 30 sites. Days after this activity, the vehicles and the equipment that I've just highlighted disappear and the site returns to patterns of normalcy. We don't know precisely what Iraq was moving, but the inspectors already knew about these sites so Iraq knew that they would be coming.
We must ask ourselves: Why would Iraq suddenly move equipment of this nature before inspections if they were anxious to demonstrate what they had or did not have?
Remember the first intercept in which two Iraqis talked about the need to hide a modified vehicle from the inspectors. Where did Iraq take all of this equipment? Why wasn't it presented to the inspectors?

Iraq also has refused to permit any U-2 reconnaissance flights that would give the inspectors a better sense of what's being moved before, during and after inspections. This refusal to allow this kind of reconnaissance is in direct, specific violation of operative paragraph seven of our Resolution 1441.

Saddam Hussein and his regime are not just trying to conceal weapons; they are also trying to hide people. You know the basic facts. Iraq has not complied with its obligation to allow immediate, unimpeded, unrestricted and private access to all officials and other persons, as required by Resolution 1441. The regime only allows interviews with inspectors in the presence of an Iraqi official, a minder. The official Iraqi organization charged with facilitating inspections announced publicly and announced ominously, that, ""Nobody is ready"" to leave Iraq to be interviewed.
Iraqi Vice President Ramadan accused the inspectors of conducting espionage, a veiled threat that anyone cooperating with UN inspectors was committing treason.
Iraq did not meet its obligations under 1441 to provide a comprehensive list of scientists associated with its weapons of mass destruction programs. Iraq's list was out of date and contained only about 500 names despite the fact that UNSCOM had earlier put together a list of about 3,500 names.
Let me just tell you what a number of human sources have told us. Saddam Hussein has directly participated in the effort to prevent interviews. In early December, Saddam Hussein had all Iraqi scientists warned of the serious consequences that they and their families would face if they revealed any sensitive information to the inspectors. They were forced to sign documents acknowledging that divulging information is punishable by death.
Saddam Hussein also said that scientists should be told not to agree to leave Iraq; anyone who agreed to be interviewed outside Iraq would be treated as a spy. This violates 1441.
In mid-November, just before the inspectors returned, Iraqi experts were ordered to report to the headquarters of the Special Security Organization to receive counter-intelligence training. The training focused on evasion methods, interrogation resistance techniques, and how to mislead inspectors.
Ladies and gentlemen, these are not assertions. These are facts corroborated by many sources, some of them sources of the intelligence services of other countries.
For example, in mid-December, weapons experts at one facility were replaced by Iraqi intelligence agents who were to deceive inspectors about the work that was being done there. On orders from Saddam Hussein, Iraqi officials issued a false death certificate for one scientist and he was sent into hiding.
In the middle of January, experts at one facility that was related to weapons of mass destruction, those experts had been ordered to stay home from work to avoid the inspectors. Workers from other Iraqi military facilities not engaged in illicit weapons projects were to replace the workers who had been sent home. A dozen experts have been placed under house arrest -- not in their own houses, but as a group at one of Saddam Hussein's guest houses.
It goes on and on and on. As the examples I have just presented show, the information and intelligence we have gathered point to an active and systematic effort on the part of the Iraqi regime to keep key materials and people from the inspectors, in direct violation of Resolution 1441.
The pattern is not just one of reluctant cooperation, nor is it merely a lack of cooperation. What we see is a deliberate campaign to prevent any meaningful inspection work.
My colleagues, Operative Paragraph 4 of UN Resolution 1441, which we lingered over so long last fall, clearly states that false statements and omissions in the declaration and a failure by Iraq at any time to comply with and cooperate fully in the implementation of this resolution shall constitute -- the facts speak for themselves -- shall constitute a further material breach of its obligation.
We wrote it this way to give Iraq an early test, to give Iraq an early test. Would they give an honest declaration and would they, early on, indicate a willingness to cooperate with the inspectors? It was designed to be an early test. They failed that test.
By this standard, the standard of this Operative Paragraph, I believe that Iraq is now in further material breach of its obligations. I believe this conclusion is irrefutable and undeniable.
Iraq has now placed itself in danger of the serious consequences called for in UN Resolution 1441. And this body places itself in danger of irrelevance if it allows Iraq to continue to defy its will without responding effectively and immediately.
This issue before us is not how much time we are willing to give the inspectors to be frustrated by Iraqi obstruction. But how much longer are we willing to put up with Iraq's non-compliance before we, as a Council, we as the United Nations say, ""Enough. Enough.""

The gravity of this moment is matched by the gravity of the threat that Iraq's weapons of mass destruction pose to the world. Let me now turn to those deadly weapons programs and describe why they are real and present dangers to the region and to the world.
First, biological weapons. We have talked frequently here about biological weapons. By way of introduction and history, I think there are just three quick points I need to make. First, you will recall that it took UNSCOM four long and frustrating years to pry, to pry an admission out of Iraq that it had biological weapons. Second, when Iraq finally admitted having these weapons in 1995, the quantities were vast. Less than a teaspoon of dry anthrax, a little bit -- about this amount. This is just about the amount of a teaspoon. Less than a teaspoonful of dry anthrax in an envelope shut down the United States Senate in the fall of 2001.
This forced several hundred people to undergo emergency medical treatment and killed two postal workers just from an amount, just about this quantity that was inside of an envelope.
Iraq declared 8500 liters of anthrax. But UNSCOM estimates that Saddam Hussein could have produced 25,000 liters. If concentrated into this dry form, this amount would be enough to fill tens upon tens upon tens of thousands of teaspoons. And Saddam Hussein has not verifiably accounted for even one teaspoonful of this deadly material. And that is my third point. And it is key. The Iraqis have never accounted for all of the biological weapons they admitted they had and we know they had.
They have never accounted for all the organic material used to make them. And they have not accounted for many of the weapons filled with these agents such as their R-400 bombs. This is evidence, not conjecture. This is true. This is all well documented.
Dr. Blix told this Council that Iraq has provided little evidence to verify anthrax production and no convincing evidence of its destruction. It should come as no shock then that since Saddam Hussein forced out the last inspectors in 1998, we have amassed much intelligence indicating that Iraq is continuing to make these weapons.
One of the most worrisome things that emerges from the thick intelligence file we have on Iraq's biological weapons is the existence of mobile production facilities used to make biological agents.
Let me take you inside that intelligence file and share with you what we know from eyewitness accounts. We have first-hand descriptions of biological weapons factories on wheels and on rails.

The trucks and train cars are easily moved and are designed to evade detection by inspectors. In a matter of months, they can produce a quantity of biological poison equal to the entire amount that Iraq claimed to have produced in the years prior to the Gulf War.
Although Iraq's mobile production program began in the mid-1990s, UN inspectors at the time only had vague hints of such programs. Confirmation came later, in the year 2000. The source was an eyewitness, an Iraqi chemical engineer who supervised one of these facilities. He actually was present during biological agent production runs. He was also at the site when an accident occurred in 1998. 12 technicians died from exposure to biological agents.
He reported that when UNSCOM was in country and inspecting, the biological weapons agent production always began on Thursdays at midnight, because Iraq thought UNSCOM would not inspect on the Muslim holy day, Thursday night through Friday.
He added that this was important because the units could not be broken down in the middle of a production run, which had to be completed by Friday evening before the inspectors might arrive again.
This defector is currently hiding in another country with the certain knowledge that Saddam Hussein will kill him if he finds him. His eyewitness account of these mobile production facilities has been corroborated by other sources.
A second source. An Iraqi civil engineer in a position to know the details of the program confirmed the existence of transportable facilities moving on trailers.
A third source, also in a position to know, reported in summer, 2002, that Iraq had manufactured mobile production systems mounted on road-trailer units and on rail cars.
Finally, a fourth source. An Iraqi major who defected confirmed that Iraq has mobile biological research laboratories in addition to the production facilities I mentioned earlier.

We have diagrammed what our sources reported about these mobile facilities. Here you see both truck and rail-car mounted mobile factories. The description our sources gave us of the technical features required by such facilities is highly detailed and extremely accurate.
As these drawings, based on their description show, we know what the fermentors look like. We know what the tanks, pumps, compressors and other parts look like. We know how they fit together, we know how they work, and we know a great deal about the platforms on which they are mounted.
As shown in this diagram, these factories can be concealed easily -- either by moving ordinary looking trucks and rail-cars along Iraq's thousands of miles of highway or track or by parking them in a garage or a warehouse or somewhere in Iraq's extensive system of underground tunnels and bunkers.

We know that Iraq has at least seven of these mobile, biological agent factories. The truck-mounted ones have at least two or three trucks each. That means that the mobile production facilities are very few -- perhaps 18 trucks that we know of. There may be more. But perhaps 18 that we know of. Just imagine trying to find 18 trucks among the thousands and thousands of trucks that travel the roads of Iraq every single day.
It took the inspectors four years to find out that Iraq was making biological agents. How long do you think it will take the inspectors to find even one of these 18 trucks without Iraq coming forward as they are supposed to with the information about these kinds of capabilities.
Ladies and gentlemen, these are sophisticated facilities. For example, they can produce anthrax and botulinum toxin. In fact, they can produce enough dry, biological agent in a single month to kill thousands upon thousands of people. A dry agent of this type is the most lethal form for human beings.
By 1998, UN experts agreed that the Iraqis had perfected drying techniques for their biological weapons programs. Now Iraq has incorporated this drying expertise into these mobile production facilities.
We know from Iraq's past admissions that it has successfully weaponized not only anthrax, but also other biological agents including botulinum toxin, aflatoxin and ricin. But Iraq's research efforts did not stop there.
Saddam Hussein has investigated dozens of biological agents causing diseases such as gas gangrene, plague, typhus, tetanus, cholera, camelpox, and hemorrhagic fever. And he also has the wherewithal to develop smallpox.

The Iraqi regime has also developed ways to disperse lethal biological agents widely, indiscriminately into the water supply, into the air. For example, Iraq had a program to modify aerial fuel tanks for Mirage jets. This video of an Iraqi test flight obtained by UNSCOM some years ago shows an Iraqi F-1 Mirage jet aircraft. Note the spray coming from beneath the Mirage. That is 2,000 liters of simulated anthrax that a jet is spraying.
(VIDEO)
In 1995, an Iraqi military officer, Mujahid Saleh Abdul Latif told inspectors that Iraq intended the spray tanks to be mounted onto a MiG-21 that had been converted into an unmanned aerial vehicle, or UAV. UAVs outfitted with spray tanks constitute an ideal method for launching a terrorist attack using biological weapons.
Iraq admitted to producing four spray tanks, but to this day, it has provided no credible evidence that they were destroyed, evidence that was required by the international community.
There can be no doubt that Saddam Hussein has biological weapons and the capability to rapidly produce more, many more. And he has the ability to dispense these lethal poisons and diseases in ways that can cause massive death and destruction.

If biological weapons seem too terrible to contemplate, chemical weapons are equally chilling. UNMOVIC already laid out much of this and it is documented for all of us to read in UNSCOM's 1999 report on the subject. Let me set the stage with three key points that all of us need to keep in mind. First, Saddam Hussein has used these horrific weapons on another country and on his own people. In fact, in the history of chemical warfare, no country has had more battlefield experience with chemical weapons since World War I than Saddam Hussein's Iraq.
Second, as with biological weapons, Saddam Hussein has never accounted for vast amounts of chemical weaponry: 550 artillery shells with mustard, 30,000 empty munitions and enough precursors to increase his stockpile to as much as 500 tons of chemical agents.
If we consider just one category of missing weaponry, 6500 bombs from the Iran-Iraq War, UNMOVIC says the amount of chemical agent in them would be on the order of a thousand tons.
These quantities of chemical weapons are now unaccounted for. Dr. Blix has quipped that, ""Mustard gas is not marmalade. You are supposed to know what you did with it."" We believe Saddam Hussein knows what he did with it and he has not come clean with the international community.
We have evidence these weapons existed. What we don't have is evidence from Iraq that they have been destroyed or where they are. That is what we are still waiting for.
Third point, Iraq's record on chemical weapons is replete with lies. It took years for Iraq to finally admit that it had produced four tons of the deadly nerve agent VX. A single drop of VX on the skin will kill in minutes. Four tons. The admission only came out after inspectors collected documentation as a result of the defection of Hussein Kamel, Saddam Hussein's late son-in-law.
UNSCOM also gained forensic evidence that Iraq had produced VX and put it into weapons for delivery, yet to this day Iraq denies it had ever weaponized VX. And on January 27, UNMOVIC told this Council that it has information that conflicts with the Iraqi account of its VX program.
We know that Iraq has embedded key portions of its illicit chemical weapons infrastructure within its legitimate civilian industry. To all outward appearances, even to experts, the infrastructure looks like an ordinary civilian operation. Illicit and legitimate production can go on simultaneously or on a dime. This dual-use infrastructure can turn from clandestine to commercial and then back again.
These inspections would be unlikely, any inspections at such facilities, would be unlikely to turn up anything prohibited, especially if there is any warning that the inspections are coming. Call it ingenious or evil genius, but the Iraqis deliberately designed their chemical weapons programs to be inspected. It is infrastructure with a built in alibi.
Under the guise of dual-use infrastructure, Iraq has undertaken an effort to reconstitute facilities that were closely associated with its past program to develop and produce chemical weapons. For example, Iraq has rebuilt key portions of the Tareq State Establishment. Tareq includes facilities designed specifically for Iraq's chemical weapons program and employs key figures from past programs.
That's the production end of Saddam's chemical weapons business. What about the delivery end? I'm going to show you a small part of a chemical complex called ""Al Musayyib"", a site that Iraq has used for at least three years to transship chemical weapons from production facilities out to the field. In May 2002, our satellites photographed the unusual activity in this picture.

Here we see cargo vehicles are again at this transshipment point, and we can see that they are accompanied by a decontamination vehicle associated with biological or chemical weapons activity. What makes this picture significant is that we have a human source who has corroborated that movement of chemical weapons occurred at this site at that time. So it's not just the photo and it's not an individual seeing the photo. It's the photo and then the knowledge of an individual being brought together to make the case.

This photograph of the site taken two months later, in July, shows not only the previous site which is the figure in the middle at the top with the bulldozer sign near it, it shows that this previous site, as well as all of the other sites around the site have been fully bulldozed and graded. The topsoil has been removed. The Iraqis literally removed the crust of the earth from large portions of this site in order to conceal chemical weapons evidence that would be there from years of chemical weapons activity.
To support its deadly biological and chemical weapons programs, Iraq procures needed items from around the world using an extensive clandestine network. What we know comes largely from intercepted communications and human sources who are in a position to know the facts.
Iraq's procurement efforts include: equipment that can filter and separate microorganisms and toxins involved in biological weapons; equipment that can be used to concentrate the agent; growth media that can be used to continue producing anthrax and botulinum toxin; sterilization equipment for laboratories; glass-lined reactors and specialty pumps that can handle corrosive chemical weapons agents and precursors; large amounts of thionyl chloride, a precursor for nerve and blister agents; and other chemicals such as sodium sulfide, an important mustard agent precursor.
Now, of course, Iraq will argue that these items can also be used for legitimate purposes. But if that is true, why do we have to learn about them by intercepting communications and risking the lives of human agents?
With Iraq's well-documented history on biological and chemical weapons, why should any of us give Iraq the benefit of the doubt? I don't. And I don't think you will either after you hear this next intercept.
Just a few weeks ago we intercepted communications between two commanders in Iraq's Second Republican Guard Corps. One commander is going to be giving an instruction to the other. You will hear as this unfolds that what he wants to communicate to the other guy, he wants to make sure the other guy hears clearly to the point of repeating it so that it gets written down and completely understood. Listen.
(Transmission.) AUDIO

Let's review a few selected items of this conversation. Two officers talking to each other on the radio want to make sure that nothing is misunderstood. ""Remove."" ""Remove."" ""The expression."" ""The expression."" ""The expression. I got it."" ""Nerve agents."" ""Nerve agents."" ""Wherever it comes up."" ""Got it, wherever it comes up."" ""In the wireless instructions."" ""In the instructions."" ""Correction, no, in the wireless instructions."" ""Wireless, I got it.""
Why does he repeat it that way? Why is he so forceful in making sure this is understood? And why did he focus on wireless instructions? Because the senior officer is concerned that somebody might be listening. Well, somebody was.
""Nerve agents."" ""Stop talking about it."" ""They are listening to us"" ""Don't give any evidence that we have these horrible agents."" But we know that they do and this kind of conversation confirms it.
Our conservative estimate is that Iraq today has a stockpile of between 100 and 500 tons of chemical weapons agent. That is enough agent to fill 16,000 battlefield rockets. Even the low end of 100 tons of agent would enable Saddam Hussein to cause mass casualties across more than 100 square miles of territory, an area nearly five times the size of Manhattan.

Let me remind you that -- of the 122 mm chemical warheads that the UN inspectors found recently. This discovery could very well be, as has been noted, the tip of a submerged iceberg.
The question before us all, my friends, is when will we see the rest of the submerged iceberg?
(VIDEO)
Saddam Hussein has chemical weapons. Saddam Hussein has used such weapons. And Saddam Hussein has no compunction about using them again -- against his neighbors and against his own people. And we have sources who tell us that he recently has authorized his field commanders to use them. He wouldn't be passing out the orders if he didn't have the weapons or the intent to use them.
We also have sources who tell us that since the 1980s, Saddam's regime has been experimenting on human beings to perfect its biological or chemical weapons.
A source said that 1,600 death-row prisoners were transferred in 1995 to a special unit for such experiments. An eyewitness saw prisoners tied down to beds, experiments conducted on them, blood oozing around the victims' mouths, and autopsies performed to confirm the effects on the prisoners.
Saddam Hussein's humanity -- inhumanity has no limits.

Let me turn now to nuclear weapons. We have no indication that Saddam Hussein has ever abandoned his nuclear weapons program. On the contrary, we have more than a decade of proof that he remains determined to acquire nuclear weapons.
To fully appreciate the challenge that we face today, remember that in 1991 the inspectors searched Iraq's primary nuclear weapons facilities for the first time, and they found nothing to conclude that Iraq had a nuclear weapons program. But, based on defector information, in May of 1991, Saddam Hussein's lie was exposed. In truth, Saddam Hussein had a massive clandestine nuclear weapons program that covered several different techniques to enrich uranium, including electromagnetic isotope separation, gas centrifuge and gas diffusion.
We estimate that this illicit program cost the Iraqis several billion dollars. Nonetheless, Iraq continued to tell the IAEA that it had no nuclear weapons program. If Saddam had not been stopped, Iraq could have produced a nuclear bomb by 1993, years earlier than most worst case assessments that had been made before the war.
In 1995, as a result of another defector, we find out that, after his invasion of Kuwait, Saddam Hussein had initiated a crash program to build a crude nuclear weapon, in violation of Iraq's UN obligations. Saddam Hussein already possesses two out of the three key components needed to build a nuclear bomb. He has a cadre of nuclear scientists with the expertise and he has a bomb design.
Since 1998, his efforts to reconstitute his nuclear program have been focused on acquiring the third and last component: sufficient fissile material to produce a nuclear explosion. To make the fissile material, he needs to develop an ability to enrich uranium. Saddam Hussein is determined to get his hands on a nuclear bomb.

He is so determined that has made repeated covert attempts to acquire high-specification aluminum tubes from 11 different countries, even after inspections resumed. These tubes are controlled by the Nuclear Suppliers Group precisely because they can be used as centrifuges for enriching uranium.
By now, just about everyone has heard of these tubes and we all know that there are differences of opinion. There is controversy about what these tubes are for. Most U.S. experts think they are intended to serve as rotors in centrifuges used to enrich uranium. Other experts, and the Iraqis themselves, argue that they are really to produce the rocket bodies for a conventional weapon, a multiple rocket launcher.
Let me tell you what is not controversial about these tubes. First, all the experts who have analyzed the tubes in our possession agree that they can be adapted for centrifuge use.
Second, Iraq had no business buying them for any purpose. They are banned for Iraq.
I am no expert on centrifuge tubes, but this is an old army trooper. I can tell you a couple things.
First, it strikes me as quite odd that these tubes are manufactured to a tolerance that far exceeds U.S. requirements for comparable rockets. Maybe Iraqis just manufacture their conventional weapons to a higher standard than we do, but I don't think so.

Second, we actually have examined tubes from several different batches that were seized clandestinely before they reached Baghdad. What we notice in these different batches is a progression to higher and higher levels of specification, including in the latest batch an anodized coating on extremely smooth inner and outer surfaces.
Why would they continue refining the specifications? Why would they continuing refining the specification, go to all that trouble for something that, if it was a rocket, would soon be blown into shrapnel when it went off?
The high-tolerance aluminum tubes are only part of the story. We also have intelligence from multiple sources that Iraq is attempting to acquire magnets and high-speed balancing machines. Both items can be used in a gas centrifuge program to enrich uranium.
In 1999 and 2000, Iraqi officials negotiated with firms in Romania, India, Russia and Slovenia for the purchase of a magnet production plant. Iraq wanted the plant to produce magnets weighing 20 to 30 grams. That's the same weight as the magnets used in Iraq's gas centrifuge program before the Gulf War.
This incident, linked with the tubes, is another indicator of Iraq's attempt to reconstitute its nuclear weapons program.
Intercepted communications from mid-2000 through last summer showed that Iraq front companies sought to buy machines that can be used to balance gas centrifuge rotors. One of these companies also had been involved in a failed effort in 2001 to smuggle aluminum tubes into Iraq.
People will continue to debate this issue, but there is no doubt in my mind. These illicit procurement efforts show that Saddam Hussein is very much focused on putting in place the key missing piece from his nuclear weapons program, the ability to produce fissile material.
He also has been busy trying to maintain the other key parts of his nuclear program, particularly his cadre of key nuclear scientists. It is noteworthy that over the last 18 months Saddam Hussein has paid increasing personal attention to Iraq's top nuclear scientists, a group that the government-controlled press calls openly his ""nuclear mujaheddin."" He regularly exhorts them and praises their progress. Progress toward what end?

Long ago, the Security Council, this Council, required Iraq to halt all nuclear activities of any kind.
Let me talk now about the systems Iraq is developing to deliver weapons of mass destruction, in particular Iraq's ballistic missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles, UAVs.

First, missiles. We all remember that before the Gulf War Saddam Hussein's goal was missiles that flew not just hundreds, but thousands, of kilometers. He wanted to strike not only his neighbors, but also nations far beyond his borders.
While inspectors destroyed most of the prohibited ballistic missiles, numerous intelligence reports over the past decade from sources inside Iraq indicate that Saddam Hussein retains a covert force of up to a few dozen Scud-variant ballistic missiles. These are missiles with a range of 650 to 900 kilometers.
We know from intelligence and Iraq's own admissions that Iraq's alleged permitted ballistic missiles, the al-Samoud II and the Al-Fatah, violate the 150-kilometer limit established by this Council in Resolution 687. These are prohibited systems.
UNMOVIC has also reported that Iraq has illegally imported 380 SA-2 rocket engines. These are likely for use in the al-Samoud II. Their import was illegal on three counts: Resolution 687 prohibited all military shipments into Iraq; UNSCOM specifically prohibited use of these engines in surface-to-surface missiles; and finally, as we have just noted, they are for a system that exceeds the 150-kilometer range limit. Worst of all, some of these engines were acquired as late as December, after this Council passed Resolution 1441.
What I want you to know today is that Iraq has programs that are intended to produce ballistic missiles that fly over 1,000 kilometers. One program is pursuing a liquid fuel missile that would be able to fly more than 1,200 kilometers. And you can see from this map, as well as I can, who will be in danger of these missiles.

As part of this effort, another little piece of evidence, Iraq has built an engine test stand that is larger than anything it has ever had. Notice the dramatic difference in size between the test stand on the left, the old one, and the new one on the right. Note the large exhaust vent. This is where the flame from the engine comes out. The exhaust vent on the right test stand is five times longer than the one on the left. The one of the left is used for short-range missiles. The one on the right is clearly intended for long-range missiles that can fly 1,200 kilometers.
This photograph was taken in April of 2002. Since then, the test stand has been finished and a roof has been put over it so it will be harder for satellites to see what's going on underneath the test stand.
Saddam Hussein's intentions have never changed. He is not developing the missiles for self-defense. These are missiles that Iraq wants in order to project power, to threaten and to deliver chemical, biological -- and if we let him -- nuclear warheads.

Now, unmanned aerial vehicles, UAVs. Iraq has been working on a variety of UAVs for more than a decade. This is just illustrative of what a UAV would look like. This effort has included attempts to modify for unmanned flight the MiG-21 and, with greater success, an aircraft called the L-29.
However, Iraq is now concentrating not on these airplanes but on developing and testing smaller UAVs such as this. UAVs are well suited for dispensing chemical and biological weapons. There is ample evidence that Iraq has dedicated much effort to developing and testing spray devices that could be adapted for UAVs.
And in the little that Saddam Hussein told us about UAVs, he has not told the truth. One of these lies is graphically and indisputably demonstrated by intelligence we collected on June 27th last year.

According to Iraq's December 7th declaration, its UAVs have a range of only 80 kilometers. But we detected one of Iraq's newest UAVs in a test flight that went 500 kilometers nonstop on autopilot in the racetrack pattern depicted here.
Not only is this test well in excess of the 150 kilometers that the United Nations permits, the test was left out of Iraq’s December 7th declaration. The UAV was flown around and around and around in this circle and so that its 80-kilometer limit really was 500 kilometers, unrefueled and on autopilot -- violative of all of its obligations under 1441.
The linkages over the past ten years between Iraq's UAV program and biological and chemical warfare agents are of deep concern to us. Iraq could use these small UAVs which have a wingspan of only a few meters to deliver biological agents to its neighbors or, if transported, to other countries, including the United States.
My friends, the information I have presented to you about these terrible weapons and about Iraq's continued flaunting of its obligations under Security Council Resolution 1441 links to a subject I now want to spend a little bit of time on, and that has to do with terrorism.

Our concern is not just about these illicit weapons; it's the way that these illicit weapons can be connected to terrorists and terrorist organizations that have no compunction about using such devices against innocent people around the world.
Iraq and terrorism go back decades. Baghdad trains Palestine Liberation Front members in small arms and explosives. Saddam uses the Arab Liberation Front to funnel money to the families of Palestinian suicide bombers in order to prolong the Intifadah. And it's no secret that Saddam's own intelligence service was involved in dozens of attacks or attempted assassinations in the 1990s.
But what I want to bring to your attention today is the potentially much more sinister nexus between Iraq and the al-Qaida terrorist network, a nexus that combines classic terrorist organizations and modern methods of murder. Iraq today harbors a deadly terrorist network headed by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi an associate and collaborator of Usama bin Laden and his al-Qaida lieutenants.
Zarqawi, Palestinian born in Jordan, fought in the Afghan war more than a decade ago. Returning to Afghanistan in 2000, he oversaw a terrorist training camp. One of his specialties, and one of the specialties of this camp, is poisons.

When our coalition ousted the Taliban, the Zarqawi network helped establish another poison and explosive training center camp, and this camp is located in northeastern Iraq. You see a picture of this camp.
The network is teaching its operatives how to produce ricin and other poisons. Let me remind you how ricin works. Less than a pinch -- imagine a pinch of salt -- less than a pinch of ricin, eating just this amount in your food, would cause shock, followed by circulatory failure. Death comes within 72 hours and there is no antidote. There is no cure. It is fatal.

Those helping to run this camp are Zarqawi lieutenants operating in northern Kurdish areas outside Saddam Hussein's controlled Iraq. But Baghdad has an agent in the most senior levels of the radical organization Ansar al-Islam that controls this corner of Iraq. In 2000, this agent offered al-Qaida safe haven in the region.
After we swept al-Qaida from Afghanistan, some of those members accepted this safe haven. They remain there today.
Zarqawi's activities are not confined to this small corner of northeast Iraq. He traveled to Baghdad in May of 2002 for medical treatment, staying in the capital of Iraq for two months while he recuperated to fight another day.
During his stay, nearly two dozen extremists converged on Baghdad and established a base of operations there. These al-Qaida affiliates based in Baghdad now coordinate the movement of people, money and supplies into and throughout Iraq for his network, and they have now been operating freely in the capital for more than eight months.
Iraqi officials deny accusations of ties with al-Qaida. These denials are simply not credible. Last year, an al-Qaida associate bragged that the situation in Iraq was ""good,"" that Baghdad could be transited quickly.
We know these affiliates are connected to Zarqawi because they remain, even today, in regular contact with his direct subordinates, include the poison cell plotters. And they are involved in moving more than money and materiel. Last year, two suspected al-Qaida operatives were arrested crossing from Iraq into Saudi Arabia. They were linked to associates of the Baghdad cell and one of them received training in Afghanistan on how to use cyanide.
From his terrorist network in Iraq, Zarqawi can direct his network in the Middle East and beyond. We in the United States, all of us, the State Department and the Agency for International Development, we all lost a dear friend with the cold-blooded murder of Mr. Laurence Foley in Amman, Jordan, last October. A despicable act was committed that day, the assassination of an individual whose sole mission was to assist the people of Jordan. The captured assassin says his cell received money and weapons from Zarqawi for that murder. After the attack, an associate of the assassin left Jordan to go to Iraq to obtain weapons and explosives for further operations. Iraqi officials protest that they are not aware of the whereabouts of Zarqawi or of any of his associates. Again, these protests are not credible. We know of Zarqawi's activities in Baghdad. I described them earlier.
Now let me add one other fact. We asked a friendly security service to approach Baghdad about extraditing Zarqawi and providing information about him and his close associates. This service contacted Iraqi officials twice and we passed details that should have made it easy to find Zarqawi. The network remains in Baghdad. Zarqawi still remains at large, to come and go.

As my colleagues around this table and as the citizens they represent in Europe know, Zarqawi's terrorism is not confined to the Middle East. Zarqawi and his network have plotted terrorist actions against countries including France, Britain, Spain, Italy, Germany and Russia. According to detainees Abu Atiya, who graduated from Zarqawi's terrorist camp in Afghanistan, tasked at least nine North African extremists in 2001 to travel to Europe to conduct poison and explosive attacks.

Since last year, members of this network have been apprehended in France, Britain, Spain and Italy. By our last count, 116 operatives connected to this global web have been arrested. The chart you are seeing shows the network in Europe.
We know about this European network and we know about its links to Zarqawi because the detainees who provided the information about the targets also provided the names of members of the network. Three of those he identified by name were arrested in France last December. In the apartments of the terrorists, authorities found circuits for explosive devices and a list of ingredients to make toxins.
The detainee who helped piece this together says the plot also targeted Britain. Later evidence again proved him right. When the British unearthed the cell there just last month, one British police officer was murdered during the destruction of the cell.

We also know that Zarqawi's colleagues have been active in the Pankisi Gorge, Georgia, and in Chechnya, Russia. The plotting to which they are linked is not mere chatter. Members of Zarqawi's network say their goal was to kill Russians with toxins.
We are not surprised that Iraq is harboring Zarqawi and his subordinates. This understanding builds on decades-long experience with respect to ties between Iraq and al-Qaida. Going back to the early and mid-1990s when bin Laden was based in Sudan, an al-Qaida source tells us that Saddam and bin Laden reached an understanding that al-Qaida would no longer support activities against Baghdad. Early al-Qaida ties were forged by secret high-level intelligence service contacts with al-Qaida, secret Iraqi intelligence high-level contacts with al-Qaida.
We know members of both organizations met repeatedly and have met at least eight times at very senior levels since the early 1990s. In 1996, a foreign security service tells us that bin Laden met with a senior Iraqi intelligence official in Khartoum and later met the director of the Iraqi intelligence service.
Saddam became more interested as he saw al-Qaida's appalling attacks. A detained al-Qaida member tells us that Saddam was more willing to assist al-Qaida after the 1998 bombings of our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Saddam was also impressed by al-Qaida's attacks on the USS Cole in Yemen in October 2000.
Iraqis continue to visit bin Laden in his new home in Afghanistan. A senior defector, one of Saddam's former intelligence chiefs in Europe, says Saddam sent his agents to Afghanistan sometime in the mid-1990s to provide training to al-Qaida members on document forgery.
From the late 1990s until 2001, the Iraqi Embassy in Pakistan played the role of liaison to the al-Qaida organization.
Some believe, some claim, these contacts do not amount to much. They say Saddam Hussein's secular tyranny and al-Qaida's religious tyranny do not mix. I am not comforted by this thought. Ambition and hatred are enough to bring Iraq and al-Qaida together, enough so al-Qaida could learn how to build more sophisticated bombs and learn how to forge documents, and enough so that al-Qaida could turn to Iraq for help in acquiring expertise on weapons of mass destruction.
And the record of Saddam Hussein's cooperation with other Islamist terrorist organizations is clear. Hamas, for example, opened an office in Baghdad in 1999 and Iraq has hosted conferences attended by Palestine Islamic Jihad. These groups are at the forefront of sponsoring suicide attacks against Israel.
Al-Qaida continues to have a deep interest in acquiring weapons of mass destruction. As with the story of Zarqawi and his network, I can trace the story of a senior terrorist operative telling how Iraq provided training in these weapons to al-Qaida. Fortunately, this operative is now detained and he has told his story. I will relate it to you now as he, himself, described it.
This senior al-Qaida terrorist was responsible for one of al-Qaida's training camps in Afghanistan. His information comes firsthand from his personal involvement at senior levels of al-Qaida. He says bin Laden and his top deputy in Afghanistan, deceased al-Qaida leader Muhammad Atif, did not believe that al-Qaida labs in Afghanistan were capable enough to manufacture these chemical or biological agents. They needed to go somewhere else. They had to look outside of Afghanistan for help.
Where did they go? Where did they look? They went to Iraq. The support that this detainee describes included Iraq offering chemical or biological weapons training for two al-Qaida associates beginning in December 2000. He says that a militant known as Abdallah al-Iraqi had been sent to Iraq several times between 1997 and 2000 for help in acquiring poisons and gasses. Abdallah al-Iraqi characterized the relationship he forged with Iraqi officials as successful.
As I said at the outset, none of this should come as a surprise to any of us. Terrorism has been a tool used by Saddam for decades. Saddam was a supporter of terrorism long before these terrorist networks had a name, and this support continues. The nexus of poisons and terror is new. The nexus of Iraq and terror is old. The combination is lethal.
With this track record, Iraqi denials of supporting terrorism take their place alongside the other Iraqi denials of weapons of mass destruction. It is all a web of lies.
When we confront a regime that harbors ambitions for regional domination, hides weapons of mass destruction, and provides haven and active support for terrorists, we are not confronting the past; we are confronting the present. And unless we act, we are confronting an even more frightening future.

And, friends, this has been a long and a detailed presentation and I thank you for your patience, but there is one more subject that I would like to touch on briefly, and it should be a subject of deep and continuing concern to this Council: Saddam Hussein's violations of human rights.
Underlying all that I have said, underlying all the facts and the patterns of behavior that I have identified, is Saddam Hussein's contempt for the will of this Council, his contempt for the truth, and, most damning of all, his utter contempt for human life. Saddam Hussein's use of mustard and nerve gas against the Kurds in 1988 was one of the 20th century's most horrible atrocities. Five thousand men, women and children died. His campaign against the Kurds from 1987 to '89 included mass summary executions, disappearances, arbitrary jailing and ethnic cleansing, and the destruction of some 2,000 villages.
He has also conducted ethnic cleansing against the Shia Iraqis and the Marsh Arabs whose culture has flourished for more than a millennium. Saddam Hussein's police state ruthlessly eliminates anyone who dares to dissent. Iraq has more forced disappearance cases than any other country -- tens of thousands of people reported missing in the past decade.
Nothing points more clearly to Saddam Hussein's dangerous intentions and the threat he poses to all of us than his calculated cruelty to his own citizens and to his neighbors. Clearly, Saddam Hussein and his regime will stop at nothing until something stops him.

 
For more than 20 years, by word and by deed, Saddam Hussein has pursued his ambition to dominate Iraq and the broader Middle East using the only means he knows: intimidation, coercion and annihilation of all those who might stand in his way. For Saddam Hussein, possession of the world's most deadly weapons is the ultimate trump card, the one he must hold to fulfill his ambition.
We know that Saddam Hussein is determined to keep his weapons of mass destruction, is determined to make more. Given Saddam Hussein's history of aggression, given what we know of his grandiose plans, given what we know of his terrorist associations, and given his determination to exact revenge on those who oppose him, should we take the risk that he will not someday use these weapons at a time and a place and in a manner of his choosing, at a time when the world is in a much weaker position to respond?
The United States will not and cannot run that risk for the American people. Leaving Saddam Hussein in possession of weapons of mass destruction for a few more months or years is not an option, not in a post-September 11th world.
My colleagues, over three months ago, this Council recognized that Iraq continued to pose a threat to international peace and security, and that Iraq had been and remained in material breach of its disarmament obligations.
Today, Iraq still poses a threat and Iraq still remains in material breach. Indeed, by its failure to seize on its one last opportunity to come clean and disarm, Iraq has put itself in deeper material breach and closer to the day when it will face serious consequences for its continue defiance of this Council.
My colleagues, we have an obligation to our citizens. We have an obligation to this body to see that our resolutions are complied with. We wrote 1441 not in order to go to war. We wrote 1441 to try to preserve the peace. We wrote 1441 to give Iraq one last chance.
Iraq is not, so far, taking that one last chance.
We must not shrink from whatever is ahead of us. We must not fail in our duty and our responsibility to the citizens of the countries that are represented by this body.
Thank you, Mr. President.

SECRETARY POWELL: Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President and Mr. Secretary General, distinguished colleagues, I would like to begin by expressing my thanks for the special effort that each of you made to be here today. This is an important day for us all as we review the situation with respect to Iraq and its disarmament obligations under UN Security Council Resolution 1441.

Last November 8, this Council passed Resolution 1441 by a unanimous vote. The purpose of that resolution was to disarm Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction. Iraq had already been found guilty of material breach of its obligations stretching back over 16 previous resolutions and 12 years.



Resolution 1441 was not dealing with an innocent party, but a regime this Council has repeatedly convicted over the years.

Resolution 1441 gave Iraq one last chance, one last chance to come into compliance or to face serious consequences. No Council member present and voting on that day had any illusions about the nature and intent of the resolution or what serious consequences meant if Iraq did not comply.

And to assist in its disarmament, we called on Iraq to cooperate with returning inspectors from UNMOVIC and IAEA. We laid down tough standards for Iraq to meet to allow the inspectors to do their job.



This Council placed the burden on Iraq to comply and disarm, and not on the inspectors to find that which Iraq has gone out of its way to conceal for so long. Inspectors are inspectors; they are not detectives.

I asked for this session today for two purposes. First, to support the core assessments made by Dr. Blix and Dr. ElBaradei. As Dr. Blix reported to this Council on January 27, ""Iraq appears not to have come to a genuine acceptance, not even today, of the disarmament which was demanded of it.""

And as Dr. ElBaradei reported, Iraq's declaration of December 7 ""did not provide any new information relevant to certain questions that have been outstanding since 1998.""

My second purpose today is to provide you with additional information, to share with you what the United States knows about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, as well as Iraq's involvement in terrorism, which is also the subject of Resolution 1441 and other earlier resolutions.

I might add at this point that we are providing all relevant information we can to the inspection teams for them to do their work.

The material I will present to you comes from a variety of sources. Some are U.S. sources and some are those of other countries. Some are the sources are technical, such as intercepted telephone conversations and photos taken by satellites. Other sources are people who have risked their lives to let the world know what Saddam Hussein is really up to.

I cannot tell you everything that we know, but what I can share with you, when combined with what all of us have learned over the years, is deeply troubling. What you will see is an accumulation of facts and disturbing patterns of behavior. The facts and Iraqis' behavior, Iraq's behavior, demonstrate that Saddam Hussein and his regime have made no effort, no effort, to disarm, as required by the international community.

Indeed, the facts and Iraq's behavior show that Saddam Hussein and his regime are concealing their efforts to produce more weapons of mass destruction.

Let me begin by playing a tape for you. What you’re about to hear is a conversation that my government monitored. It takes place on November 26th of last year, on the day before United Nations teams resumed inspections in Iraq. The conversation involves two senior officers, a colonel and a brigadier general from Iraq's elite military unit, the Republican Guard.

[The tape is played.] AUDIO



SECRETARY POWELL: Let me pause and review some of the key elements of this conversation that you just heard between these two officers.

First, they acknowledge that our colleague, Mohammed ElBaradei is coming, and they know what he's coming for and they know he's coming the next day. He's coming to look for things that are prohibited. He is expecting these gentlemen to cooperate with him and not hide things.

But they're worried. We have this modified vehicle. What do we say if one of them sees it? What is their concern? Their concern is that it's something they should not have, something that should not be seen.

The general was incredulous: ""You didn't get it modified. You don't have one of those, do you?""



""I have one.""

""Which? From where?""

""From the workshop. From the Al-Kindi Company.""

""What?""

""From Al-Kindi.""

""I'll come to see you in the morning. I'm worried you all have something left.""



""We evacuated everything. We don't have anything left.""

Note what he says: ""We evacuated everything."" We didn't destroy it. We didn't line it up for inspection. We didn't turn it into the inspectors. We evacuated it to make sure it was not around when the inspectors showed up. ""I will come to you tomorrow.""

The Al-Kindi Company. This is a company that is well known to have been involved in prohibited weapons systems activity.

Let me play another tape for you. As you will recall, the inspectors found 12 empty chemical warheads on January 16th. On January 20th, four days later, Iraq promised the inspectors it would search for more. You will now hear an officer from Republican Guard headquarters issuing an instruction to an officer in the field. Their conversation took place just last week, on January 30.

[The tape was played.] AUDIO

SECRETARY POWELL: Let me pause again and review the elements of this message.



""They are inspecting the ammunition you have, yes?""

""Yes. For the possibility there are forbidden ammo.""

""For the possibility there is, by chance, forbidden ammo?""



""Yes.

""And we sent you a message yesterday to clean out all the areas, the scrap areas, the abandoned areas. Make sure there is nothing there. Remember the first message: evacuate it.""

This is all part of a system of hiding things and moving things out of the way and making sure they have left nothing behind.



You go a little further into this message and you see the specific instructions from headquarters: ""After you have carried out what is contained in this message, destroy the message because I don't want anyone to see this message.""

""Okay.""

""Okay.""

Why? Why? This message would have verified to the inspectors that they have been trying to turn over things. They were looking for things, but they don't want that message seen because they were trying to clean up the area, to leave no evidence behind of the presence of weapons of mass destruction. And they can claim that nothing was there and the inspectors can look all they want and they will find nothing.

This effort to hide things from the inspectors is not one or two isolated events. Quite the contrary, this is part and parcel of a policy of evasion and deception that goes back 12 years, a policy set at the highest levels of the Iraqi regime.

We know that Saddam Hussein has what is called ""a Higher Committee for Monitoring the Inspection Teams."" Think about that. Iraq has a high-level committee to monitor the inspectors who were sent in to monitor Iraq's disarmament -- not to cooperate with them, not to assist them, but to spy on them and keep them from doing their jobs.

The committee reports directly to Saddam Hussein. It is headed by Iraq's Vice President, Taha Yasin Ramadan. Its members include Saddam Hussein's son, Qusay.

This committee also includes Lieutenant General Amir al-Sa'di, an advisor to Saddam. In case that name isn't immediately familiar to you, General Sa'di has been the Iraqi regime's primary point of contact for Dr. Blix and Dr. ElBaradei. It was General Sa'di who last fall publicly pledged that Iraq was prepared to cooperate unconditionally with inspectors. Quite the contrary, Sa'di's job is not to cooperate; it is to deceive, not to disarm, but to undermine the inspectors; not to support them, but to frustrate them and to make sure they learn nothing.

We have learned a lot about the work of this special committee. We learned that just prior to the return of inspectors last November, the regime had decided to resume what we heard called ""the old game of cat-and-mouse.""

For example, let me focus on the now famous declaration that Iraq submitted to this Council on December 7th. Iraq never had any intention of complying with this Council's mandate. Instead, Iraq planned to use the declaration to overwhelm us and to overwhelm the inspectors with useless information about Iraq's permitted weapons so that we would not have time to pursue Iraq's prohibited weapons. Iraq's goal was to give us in this room, to give those of us on this Council, the false impression that the inspection process was working.

You saw the result. Dr. Blix pronounced the 12,200-page declaration ""rich in volume"" but ""poor in information and practically devoid of new evidence."" Could any member of this Council honestly rise in defense of this false declaration?

Everything we have seen and heard indicates that instead of cooperating actively with the inspectors to ensure the success of their mission, Saddam Hussein and his regime are busy doing all they possibly can to ensure that inspectors succeed in finding absolutely nothing.

My colleagues, every statement I make today is backed up by sources, solid sources. These are not assertions. What we are giving you are facts and conclusions based on solid intelligence. I will cite some examples, and these are from human sources.

Orders were issued to Iraq's security organizations, as well as to Saddam Hussein's own office, to hide all correspondence with the Organization of Military Industrialization. This is the organization that oversees Iraq's weapons of mass destruction activities. Make sure there are no documents left which would connect you to the OMI.

We know that Saddam's son, Qusay, ordered the removal of all prohibited weapons from Saddam's numerous palace complexes. We know that Iraqi government officials, members of the ruling Ba'ath Party and scientists have hidden prohibited items in their homes. Other key files from military and scientific establishments have been placed in cars that are being driven around the countryside by Iraqi intelligence agents to avoid detection.



Thanks to intelligence they were provided, the inspectors recently found dramatic confirmation of these reports. When they searched the homes of an Iraqi nuclear scientist, they uncovered roughly 2,000 pages of documents. You see them here being brought out of the home and placed in UN hands. Some of the material is classified and related to Iraq's nuclear program.

Tell me, answer me: Are the inspectors to search the house of every government official, every Ba'ath Party member and every scientist in the country to find the truth, to get the information they need to satisfy the demands of our Council?

Our sources tell us that in some cases the hard drives of computers at Iraqi weapons facilities were replaced. Who took the hard drives? Where did they go? What is being hidden? Why?

There is only one answer to the why: to deceive, to hide, to keep from the inspectors.

Numerous human sources tell us that the Iraqis are moving not just documents and hard drives, but weapons of mass destruction, to keep them from being found by inspectors. While we were here in this Council chamber debating Resolution 1441 last fall, we know, we know from sources that a missile brigade outside Baghdad was dispersing rocket launchers and warheads containing biological warfare agent to various locations, distributing them to various locations in western Iraq.

Most of the launchers and warheads had been hidden in large groves of palm trees and were to be moved every one to four weeks to escape detection.

We also have satellite photos that indicate that banned materials have recently been moved from a number of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction facilities.

Let me say a word about satellite images before I show a couple. The photos that I am about to show you are sometimes hard for the average person to interpret, hard for me. The painstaking work of photo analysis takes experts with years and years of experience, poring for hours and hours over light tables. But as I show you these images, I will try to capture and explain what they mean, what they indicate, to our imagery specialists.



Let's look at one. This one is about a weapons munition facility, a facility that holds ammunition at a place called Taji. This is one of about 65 such facilities in Iraq. We know that this one has housed chemical munitions. In fact, this is where the Iraqis recently came up with the additional four chemical weapons shells.

Here you see 15 munitions bunkers in yellow and red outlines. The four that are in red squares represent active chemical munitions bunkers.



How do I know that? How can I say that? Let me give you a closer look. Look at the image on the left. On the left is a close-up of one of the four chemical bunkers. The two arrows indicate the presence of sure signs that the bunkers are storing chemical munitions. The arrow at the top that says ""security"" points to a facility that is a signature item for this kind of bunker. Inside that facility are special guards and special equipment to monitor any leakage that might come out of the bunker. The truck you also see is a signature item. It's a decontamination vehicle in case something goes wrong. This is characteristic of those four bunkers. The special security facility and the decontamination vehicle will be in the area, if not at any one of them or one of the other, it is moving around those four and it moves as needed to move as people are working in the different bunkers.

Now look at the picture on the right. You are now looking at two of those sanitized bunkers. The signature vehicles are gone, the tents are gone. It's been cleaned up. And it was done on the 22nd of December as the UN inspection team is arriving, and you can see the inspection vehicles arriving in the lower portion of the picture on the right.

The bunkers are clean when the inspectors get there. They found nothing.

This sequence of events raises the worrisome suspicion that Iraq had been tipped off to the forthcoming inspections at Taji. As it did throughout the 1990s, we know that Iraq today is actively using its considerable intelligence capabilities to hide its illicit activities. From our sources, we know that inspectors are under constant surveillance by an army of Iraqi intelligence operatives. Iraq is relentlessly attempting to tap all of their communications, both voice and electronics. I would call my colleagues' attention to the fine paper that the United Kingdom distributed yesterday which describes in exquisite detail Iraqi deception activities.



In this next example, you will see the type of concealment activity Iraq has undertaken in response to the resumption of inspections. Indeed, in November of 2002, just when the inspections were about to resume, this type of activity spiked. Here are three examples.



At this ballistic missile site on November 10th, we saw a cargo truck preparing to move ballistic missile components.

At this biological weapons-related facility on November 25th, just two days before inspections resumed, this truck caravan appeared -- something we almost never see at this facility and we monitor it carefully and regularly.



At this ballistic missile facility, again, two days before inspections began, five large cargo trucks appeared, along with a truck-mounted crane, to move missiles.

We saw this kind of housecleaning at close to 30 sites. Days after this activity, the vehicles and the equipment that I've just highlighted disappear and the site returns to patterns of normalcy. We don't know precisely what Iraq was moving, but the inspectors already knew about these sites so Iraq knew that they would be coming.

We must ask ourselves: Why would Iraq suddenly move equipment of this nature before inspections if they were anxious to demonstrate what they had or did not have?

Remember the first intercept in which two Iraqis talked about the need to hide a modified vehicle from the inspectors. Where did Iraq take all of this equipment? Why wasn't it presented to the inspectors?



Iraq also has refused to permit any U-2 reconnaissance flights that would give the inspectors a better sense of what's being moved before, during and after inspections. This refusal to allow this kind of reconnaissance is in direct, specific violation of operative paragraph seven of our Resolution 1441.



Saddam Hussein and his regime are not just trying to conceal weapons; they are also trying to hide people. You know the basic facts. Iraq has not complied with its obligation to allow immediate, unimpeded, unrestricted and private access to all officials and other persons, as required by Resolution 1441. The regime only allows interviews with inspectors in the presence of an Iraqi official, a minder. The official Iraqi organization charged with facilitating inspections announced publicly and announced ominously, that, ""Nobody is ready"" to leave Iraq to be interviewed.

Iraqi Vice President Ramadan accused the inspectors of conducting espionage, a veiled threat that anyone cooperating with UN inspectors was committing treason.

Iraq did not meet its obligations under 1441 to provide a comprehensive list of scientists associated with its weapons of mass destruction programs. Iraq's list was out of date and contained only about 500 names despite the fact that UNSCOM had earlier put together a list of about 3,500 names.

Let me just tell you what a number of human sources have told us. Saddam Hussein has directly participated in the effort to prevent interviews. In early December, Saddam Hussein had all Iraqi scientists warned of the serious consequences that they and their families would face if they revealed any sensitive information to the inspectors. They were forced to sign documents acknowledging that divulging information is punishable by death.

Saddam Hussein also said that scientists should be told not to agree to leave Iraq; anyone who agreed to be interviewed outside Iraq would be treated as a spy. This violates 1441.

In mid-November, just before the inspectors returned, Iraqi experts were ordered to report to the headquarters of the Special Security Organization to receive counter-intelligence training. The training focused on evasion methods, interrogation resistance techniques, and how to mislead inspectors.

Ladies and gentlemen, these are not assertions. These are facts corroborated by many sources, some of them sources of the intelligence services of other countries.

For example, in mid-December, weapons experts at one facility were replaced by Iraqi intelligence agents who were to deceive inspectors about the work that was being done there. On orders from Saddam Hussein, Iraqi officials issued a false death certificate for one scientist and he was sent into hiding.

In the middle of January, experts at one facility that was related to weapons of mass destruction, those experts had been ordered to stay home from work to avoid the inspectors. Workers from other Iraqi military facilities not engaged in illicit weapons projects were to replace the workers who had been sent home. A dozen experts have been placed under house arrest -- not in their own houses, but as a group at one of Saddam Hussein's guest houses.

It goes on and on and on. As the examples I have just presented show, the information and intelligence we have gathered point to an active and systematic effort on the part of the Iraqi regime to keep key materials and people from the inspectors, in direct violation of Resolution 1441.

The pattern is not just one of reluctant cooperation, nor is it merely a lack of cooperation. What we see is a deliberate campaign to prevent any meaningful inspection work.

My colleagues, Operative Paragraph 4 of UN Resolution 1441, which we lingered over so long last fall, clearly states that false statements and omissions in the declaration and a failure by Iraq at any time to comply with and cooperate fully in the implementation of this resolution shall constitute -- the facts speak for themselves -- shall constitute a further material breach of its obligation.

We wrote it this way to give Iraq an early test, to give Iraq an early test. Would they give an honest declaration and would they, early on, indicate a willingness to cooperate with the inspectors? It was designed to be an early test. They failed that test.

By this standard, the standard of this Operative Paragraph, I believe that Iraq is now in further material breach of its obligations. I believe this conclusion is irrefutable and undeniable.

Iraq has now placed itself in danger of the serious consequences called for in UN Resolution 1441. And this body places itself in danger of irrelevance if it allows Iraq to continue to defy its will without responding effectively and immediately.

This issue before us is not how much time we are willing to give the inspectors to be frustrated by Iraqi obstruction. But how much longer are we willing to put up with Iraq's non-compliance before we, as a Council, we as the United Nations say, ""Enough. Enough.""



The gravity of this moment is matched by the gravity of the threat that Iraq's weapons of mass destruction pose to the world. Let me now turn to those deadly weapons programs and describe why they are real and present dangers to the region and to the world.

First, biological weapons. We have talked frequently here about biological weapons. By way of introduction and history, I think there are just three quick points I need to make. First, you will recall that it took UNSCOM four long and frustrating years to pry, to pry an admission out of Iraq that it had biological weapons. Second, when Iraq finally admitted having these weapons in 1995, the quantities were vast. Less than a teaspoon of dry anthrax, a little bit -- about this amount. This is just about the amount of a teaspoon. Less than a teaspoonful of dry anthrax in an envelope shut down the United States Senate in the fall of 2001.

This forced several hundred people to undergo emergency medical treatment and killed two postal workers just from an amount, just about this quantity that was inside of an envelope.

Iraq declared 8500 liters of anthrax. But UNSCOM estimates that Saddam Hussein could have produced 25,000 liters. If concentrated into this dry form, this amount would be enough to fill tens upon tens upon tens of thousands of teaspoons. And Saddam Hussein has not verifiably accounted for even one teaspoonful of this deadly material. And that is my third point. And it is key. The Iraqis have never accounted for all of the biological weapons they admitted they had and we know they had.

They have never accounted for all the organic material used to make them. And they have not accounted for many of the weapons filled with these agents such as their R-400 bombs. This is evidence, not conjecture. This is true. This is all well documented.

Dr. Blix told this Council that Iraq has provided little evidence to verify anthrax production and no convincing evidence of its destruction. It should come as no shock then that since Saddam Hussein forced out the last inspectors in 1998, we have amassed much intelligence indicating that Iraq is continuing to make these weapons.

One of the most worrisome things that emerges from the thick intelligence file we have on Iraq's biological weapons is the existence of mobile production facilities used to make biological agents.

Let me take you inside that intelligence file and share with you what we know from eyewitness accounts. We have first-hand descriptions of biological weapons factories on wheels and on rails.



The trucks and train cars are easily moved and are designed to evade detection by inspectors. In a matter of months, they can produce a quantity of biological poison equal to the entire amount that Iraq claimed to have produced in the years prior to the Gulf War.

Although Iraq's mobile production program began in the mid-1990s, UN inspectors at the time only had vague hints of such programs. Confirmation came later, in the year 2000. The source was an eyewitness, an Iraqi chemical engineer who supervised one of these facilities. He actually was present during biological agent production runs. He was also at the site when an accident occurred in 1998. 12 technicians died from exposure to biological agents.

He reported that when UNSCOM was in country and inspecting, the biological weapons agent production always began on Thursdays at midnight, because Iraq thought UNSCOM would not inspect on the Muslim holy day, Thursday night through Friday.

He added that this was important because the units could not be broken down in the middle of a production run, which had to be completed by Friday evening before the inspectors might arrive again.

This defector is currently hiding in another country with the certain knowledge that Saddam Hussein will kill him if he finds him. His eyewitness account of these mobile production facilities has been corroborated by other sources.

A second source. An Iraqi civil engineer in a position to know the details of the program confirmed the existence of transportable facilities moving on trailers.

A third source, also in a position to know, reported in summer, 2002, that Iraq had manufactured mobile production systems mounted on road-trailer units and on rail cars.

Finally, a fourth source. An Iraqi major who defected confirmed that Iraq has mobile biological research laboratories in addition to the production facilities I mentioned earlier.



We have diagrammed what our sources reported about these mobile facilities. Here you see both truck and rail-car mounted mobile factories. The description our sources gave us of the technical features required by such facilities is highly detailed and extremely accurate.

As these drawings, based on their description show, we know what the fermentors look like. We know what the tanks, pumps, compressors and other parts look like. We know how they fit together, we know how they work, and we know a great deal about the platforms on which they are mounted.

As shown in this diagram, these factories can be concealed easily -- either by moving ordinary looking trucks and rail-cars along Iraq's thousands of miles of highway or track or by parking them in a garage or a warehouse or somewhere in Iraq's extensive system of underground tunnels and bunkers.



We know that Iraq has at least seven of these mobile, biological agent factories. The truck-mounted ones have at least two or three trucks each. That means that the mobile production facilities are very few -- perhaps 18 trucks that we know of. There may be more. But perhaps 18 that we know of. Just imagine trying to find 18 trucks among the thousands and thousands of trucks that travel the roads of Iraq every single day.

It took the inspectors four years to find out that Iraq was making biological agents. How long do you think it will take the inspectors to find even one of these 18 trucks without Iraq coming forward as they are supposed to with the information about these kinds of capabilities.

Ladies and gentlemen, these are sophisticated facilities. For example, they can produce anthrax and botulinum toxin. In fact, they can produce enough dry, biological agent in a single month to kill thousands upon thousands of people. A dry agent of this type is the most lethal form for human beings.

By 1998, UN experts agreed that the Iraqis had perfected drying techniques for their biological weapons programs. Now Iraq has incorporated this drying expertise into these mobile production facilities.

We know from Iraq's past admissions that it has successfully weaponized not only anthrax, but also other biological agents including botulinum toxin, aflatoxin and ricin. But Iraq's research efforts did not stop there.

Saddam Hussein has investigated dozens of biological agents causing diseases such as gas gangrene, plague, typhus, tetanus, cholera, camelpox, and hemorrhagic fever. And he also has the wherewithal to develop smallpox.



The Iraqi regime has also developed ways to disperse lethal biological agents widely, indiscriminately into the water supply, into the air. For example, Iraq had a program to modify aerial fuel tanks for Mirage jets. This video of an Iraqi test flight obtained by UNSCOM some years ago shows an Iraqi F-1 Mirage jet aircraft. Note the spray coming from beneath the Mirage. That is 2,000 liters of simulated anthrax that a jet is spraying.
(VIDEO)

In 1995, an Iraqi military officer, Mujahid Saleh Abdul Latif told inspectors that Iraq intended the spray tanks to be mounted onto a MiG-21 that had been converted into an unmanned aerial vehicle, or UAV. UAVs outfitted with spray tanks constitute an ideal method for launching a terrorist attack using biological weapons.

Iraq admitted to producing four spray tanks, but to this day, it has provided no credible evidence that they were destroyed, evidence that was required by the international community.

There can be no doubt that Saddam Hussein has biological weapons and the capability to rapidly produce more, many more. And he has the ability to dispense these lethal poisons and diseases in ways that can cause massive death and destruction.



If biological weapons seem too terrible to contemplate, chemical weapons are equally chilling. UNMOVIC already laid out much of this and it is documented for all of us to read in UNSCOM's 1999 report on the subject. Let me set the stage with three key points that all of us need to keep in mind. First, Saddam Hussein has used these horrific weapons on another country and on his own people. In fact, in the history of chemical warfare, no country has had more battlefield experience with chemical weapons since World War I than Saddam Hussein's Iraq.

Second, as with biological weapons, Saddam Hussein has never accounted for vast amounts of chemical weaponry: 550 artillery shells with mustard, 30,000 empty munitions and enough precursors to increase his stockpile to as much as 500 tons of chemical agents.

If we consider just one category of missing weaponry, 6500 bombs from the Iran-Iraq War, UNMOVIC says the amount of chemical agent in them would be on the order of a thousand tons.

These quantities of chemical weapons are now unaccounted for. Dr. Blix has quipped that, ""Mustard gas is not marmalade. You are supposed to know what you did with it."" We believe Saddam Hussein knows what he did with it and he has not come clean with the international community.

We have evidence these weapons existed. What we don't have is evidence from Iraq that they have been destroyed or where they are. That is what we are still waiting for.

Third point, Iraq's record on chemical weapons is replete with lies. It took years for Iraq to finally admit that it had produced four tons of the deadly nerve agent VX. A single drop of VX on the skin will kill in minutes. Four tons. The admission only came out after inspectors collected documentation as a result of the defection of Hussein Kamel, Saddam Hussein's late son-in-law.

UNSCOM also gained forensic evidence that Iraq had produced VX and put it into weapons for delivery, yet to this day Iraq denies it had ever weaponized VX. And on January 27, UNMOVIC told this Council that it has information that conflicts with the Iraqi account of its VX program.

We know that Iraq has embedded key portions of its illicit chemical weapons infrastructure within its legitimate civilian industry. To all outward appearances, even to experts, the infrastructure looks like an ordinary civilian operation. Illicit and legitimate production can go on simultaneously or on a dime. This dual-use infrastructure can turn from clandestine to commercial and then back again.

These inspections would be unlikely, any inspections at such facilities, would be unlikely to turn up anything prohibited, especially if there is any warning that the inspections are coming. Call it ingenious or evil genius, but the Iraqis deliberately designed their chemical weapons programs to be inspected. It is infrastructure with a built in alibi.

Under the guise of dual-use infrastructure, Iraq has undertaken an effort to reconstitute facilities that were closely associated with its past program to develop and produce chemical weapons. For example, Iraq has rebuilt key portions of the Tareq State Establishment. Tareq includes facilities designed specifically for Iraq's chemical weapons program and employs key figures from past programs.

That's the production end of Saddam's chemical weapons business. What about the delivery end? I'm going to show you a small part of a chemical complex called ""Al Musayyib"", a site that Iraq has used for at least three years to transship chemical weapons from production facilities out to the field. In May 2002, our satellites photographed the unusual activity in this picture.



Here we see cargo vehicles are again at this transshipment point, and we can see that they are accompanied by a decontamination vehicle associated with biological or chemical weapons activity. What makes this picture significant is that we have a human source who has corroborated that movement of chemical weapons occurred at this site at that time. So it's not just the photo and it's not an individual seeing the photo. It's the photo and then the knowledge of an individual being brought together to make the case.



This photograph of the site taken two months later, in July, shows not only the previous site which is the figure in the middle at the top with the bulldozer sign near it, it shows that this previous site, as well as all of the other sites around the site have been fully bulldozed and graded. The topsoil has been removed. The Iraqis literally removed the crust of the earth from large portions of this site in order to conceal chemical weapons evidence that would be there from years of chemical weapons activity.

To support its deadly biological and chemical weapons programs, Iraq procures needed items from around the world using an extensive clandestine network. What we know comes largely from intercepted communications and human sources who are in a position to know the facts.

Iraq's procurement efforts include: equipment that can filter and separate microorganisms and toxins involved in biological weapons; equipment that can be used to concentrate the agent; growth media that can be used to continue producing anthrax and botulinum toxin; sterilization equipment for laboratories; glass-lined reactors and specialty pumps that can handle corrosive chemical weapons agents and precursors; large amounts of thionyl chloride, a precursor for nerve and blister agents; and other chemicals such as sodium sulfide, an important mustard agent precursor.

Now, of course, Iraq will argue that these items can also be used for legitimate purposes. But if that is true, why do we have to learn about them by intercepting communications and risking the lives of human agents?

With Iraq's well-documented history on biological and chemical weapons, why should any of us give Iraq the benefit of the doubt? I don't. And I don't think you will either after you hear this next intercept.

Just a few weeks ago we intercepted communications between two commanders in Iraq's Second Republican Guard Corps. One commander is going to be giving an instruction to the other. You will hear as this unfolds that what he wants to communicate to the other guy, he wants to make sure the other guy hears clearly to the point of repeating it so that it gets written down and completely understood. Listen.

(Transmission.) AUDIO



Let's review a few selected items of this conversation. Two officers talking to each other on the radio want to make sure that nothing is misunderstood. ""Remove."" ""Remove."" ""The expression."" ""The expression."" ""The expression. I got it."" ""Nerve agents."" ""Nerve agents."" ""Wherever it comes up."" ""Got it, wherever it comes up."" ""In the wireless instructions."" ""In the instructions."" ""Correction, no, in the wireless instructions."" ""Wireless, I got it.""

Why does he repeat it that way? Why is he so forceful in making sure this is understood? And why did he focus on wireless instructions? Because the senior officer is concerned that somebody might be listening. Well, somebody was.

""Nerve agents."" ""Stop talking about it."" ""They are listening to us"" ""Don't give any evidence that we have these horrible agents."" But we know that they do and this kind of conversation confirms it.

Our conservative estimate is that Iraq today has a stockpile of between 100 and 500 tons of chemical weapons agent. That is enough agent to fill 16,000 battlefield rockets. Even the low end of 100 tons of agent would enable Saddam Hussein to cause mass casualties across more than 100 square miles of territory, an area nearly five times the size of Manhattan.



Let me remind you that -- of the 122 mm chemical warheads that the UN inspectors found recently. This discovery could very well be, as has been noted, the tip of a submerged iceberg.

The question before us all, my friends, is when will we see the rest of the submerged iceberg?

(VIDEO)

Saddam Hussein has chemical weapons. Saddam Hussein has used such weapons. And Saddam Hussein has no compunction about using them again -- against his neighbors and against his own people. And we have sources who tell us that he recently has authorized his field commanders to use them. He wouldn't be passing out the orders if he didn't have the weapons or the intent to use them.

We also have sources who tell us that since the 1980s, Saddam's regime has been experimenting on human beings to perfect its biological or chemical weapons.

A source said that 1,600 death-row prisoners were transferred in 1995 to a special unit for such experiments. An eyewitness saw prisoners tied down to beds, experiments conducted on them, blood oozing around the victims' mouths, and autopsies performed to confirm the effects on the prisoners.

Saddam Hussein's humanity -- inhumanity has no limits.



Let me turn now to nuclear weapons. We have no indication that Saddam Hussein has ever abandoned his nuclear weapons program. On the contrary, we have more than a decade of proof that he remains determined to acquire nuclear weapons.

To fully appreciate the challenge that we face today, remember that in 1991 the inspectors searched Iraq's primary nuclear weapons facilities for the first time, and they found nothing to conclude that Iraq had a nuclear weapons program. But, based on defector information, in May of 1991, Saddam Hussein's lie was exposed. In truth, Saddam Hussein had a massive clandestine nuclear weapons program that covered several different techniques to enrich uranium, including electromagnetic isotope separation, gas centrifuge and gas diffusion.

We estimate that this illicit program cost the Iraqis several billion dollars. Nonetheless, Iraq continued to tell the IAEA that it had no nuclear weapons program. If Saddam had not been stopped, Iraq could have produced a nuclear bomb by 1993, years earlier than most worst case assessments that had been made before the war.

In 1995, as a result of another defector, we find out that, after his invasion of Kuwait, Saddam Hussein had initiated a crash program to build a crude nuclear weapon, in violation of Iraq's UN obligations. Saddam Hussein already possesses two out of the three key components needed to build a nuclear bomb. He has a cadre of nuclear scientists with the expertise and he has a bomb design.

Since 1998, his efforts to reconstitute his nuclear program have been focused on acquiring the third and last component: sufficient fissile material to produce a nuclear explosion. To make the fissile material, he needs to develop an ability to enrich uranium. Saddam Hussein is determined to get his hands on a nuclear bomb.



He is so determined that has made repeated covert attempts to acquire high-specification aluminum tubes from 11 different countries, even after inspections resumed. These tubes are controlled by the Nuclear Suppliers Group precisely because they can be used as centrifuges for enriching uranium.

By now, just about everyone has heard of these tubes and we all know that there are differences of opinion. There is controversy about what these tubes are for. Most U.S. experts think they are intended to serve as rotors in centrifuges used to enrich uranium. Other experts, and the Iraqis themselves, argue that they are really to produce the rocket bodies for a conventional weapon, a multiple rocket launcher.

Let me tell you what is not controversial about these tubes. First, all the experts who have analyzed the tubes in our possession agree that they can be adapted for centrifuge use.

Second, Iraq had no business buying them for any purpose. They are banned for Iraq.

I am no expert on centrifuge tubes, but this is an old army trooper. I can tell you a couple things.

First, it strikes me as quite odd that these tubes are manufactured to a tolerance that far exceeds U.S. requirements for comparable rockets. Maybe Iraqis just manufacture their conventional weapons to a higher standard than we do, but I don't think so.



Second, we actually have examined tubes from several different batches that were seized clandestinely before they reached Baghdad. What we notice in these different batches is a progression to higher and higher levels of specification, including in the latest batch an anodized coating on extremely smooth inner and outer surfaces.

Why would they continue refining the specifications? Why would they continuing refining the specification, go to all that trouble for something that, if it was a rocket, would soon be blown into shrapnel when it went off?

The high-tolerance aluminum tubes are only part of the story. We also have intelligence from multiple sources that Iraq is attempting to acquire magnets and high-speed balancing machines. Both items can be used in a gas centrifuge program to enrich uranium.

In 1999 and 2000, Iraqi officials negotiated with firms in Romania, India, Russia and Slovenia for the purchase of a magnet production plant. Iraq wanted the plant to produce magnets weighing 20 to 30 grams. That's the same weight as the magnets used in Iraq's gas centrifuge program before the Gulf War.

This incident, linked with the tubes, is another indicator of Iraq's attempt to reconstitute its nuclear weapons program.

Intercepted communications from mid-2000 through last summer showed that Iraq front companies sought to buy machines that can be used to balance gas centrifuge rotors. One of these companies also had been involved in a failed effort in 2001 to smuggle aluminum tubes into Iraq.

People will continue to debate this issue, but there is no doubt in my mind. These illicit procurement efforts show that Saddam Hussein is very much focused on putting in place the key missing piece from his nuclear weapons program, the ability to produce fissile material.

He also has been busy trying to maintain the other key parts of his nuclear program, particularly his cadre of key nuclear scientists. It is noteworthy that over the last 18 months Saddam Hussein has paid increasing personal attention to Iraq's top nuclear scientists, a group that the government-controlled press calls openly his ""nuclear mujaheddin."" He regularly exhorts them and praises their progress. Progress toward what end?



Long ago, the Security Council, this Council, required Iraq to halt all nuclear activities of any kind.

Let me talk now about the systems Iraq is developing to deliver weapons of mass destruction, in particular Iraq's ballistic missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles, UAVs.



First, missiles. We all remember that before the Gulf War Saddam Hussein's goal was missiles that flew not just hundreds, but thousands, of kilometers. He wanted to strike not only his neighbors, but also nations far beyond his borders.

While inspectors destroyed most of the prohibited ballistic missiles, numerous intelligence reports over the past decade from sources inside Iraq indicate that Saddam Hussein retains a covert force of up to a few dozen Scud-variant ballistic missiles. These are missiles with a range of 650 to 900 kilometers.

We know from intelligence and Iraq's own admissions that Iraq's alleged permitted ballistic missiles, the al-Samoud II and the Al-Fatah, violate the 150-kilometer limit established by this Council in Resolution 687. These are prohibited systems.

UNMOVIC has also reported that Iraq has illegally imported 380 SA-2 rocket engines. These are likely for use in the al-Samoud II. Their import was illegal on three counts: Resolution 687 prohibited all military shipments into Iraq; UNSCOM specifically prohibited use of these engines in surface-to-surface missiles; and finally, as we have just noted, they are for a system that exceeds the 150-kilometer range limit. Worst of all, some of these engines were acquired as late as December, after this Council passed Resolution 1441.

What I want you to know today is that Iraq has programs that are intended to produce ballistic missiles that fly over 1,000 kilometers. One program is pursuing a liquid fuel missile that would be able to fly more than 1,200 kilometers. And you can see from this map, as well as I can, who will be in danger of these missiles.



As part of this effort, another little piece of evidence, Iraq has built an engine test stand that is larger than anything it has ever had. Notice the dramatic difference in size between the test stand on the left, the old one, and the new one on the right. Note the large exhaust vent. This is where the flame from the engine comes out. The exhaust vent on the right test stand is five times longer than the one on the left. The one of the left is used for short-range missiles. The one on the right is clearly intended for long-range missiles that can fly 1,200 kilometers.

This photograph was taken in April of 2002. Since then, the test stand has been finished and a roof has been put over it so it will be harder for satellites to see what's going on underneath the test stand.

Saddam Hussein's intentions have never changed. He is not developing the missiles for self-defense. These are missiles that Iraq wants in order to project power, to threaten and to deliver chemical, biological -- and if we let him -- nuclear warheads.



Now, unmanned aerial vehicles, UAVs. Iraq has been working on a variety of UAVs for more than a decade. This is just illustrative of what a UAV would look like. This effort has included attempts to modify for unmanned flight the MiG-21 and, with greater success, an aircraft called the L-29.

However, Iraq is now concentrating not on these airplanes but on developing and testing smaller UAVs such as this. UAVs are well suited for dispensing chemical and biological weapons. There is ample evidence that Iraq has dedicated much effort to developing and testing spray devices that could be adapted for UAVs.

And in the little that Saddam Hussein told us about UAVs, he has not told the truth. One of these lies is graphically and indisputably demonstrated by intelligence we collected on June 27th last year.



According to Iraq's December 7th declaration, its UAVs have a range of only 80 kilometers. But we detected one of Iraq's newest UAVs in a test flight that went 500 kilometers nonstop on autopilot in the racetrack pattern depicted here.

Not only is this test well in excess of the 150 kilometers that the United Nations permits, the test was left out of Iraq’s December 7th declaration. The UAV was flown around and around and around in this circle and so that its 80-kilometer limit really was 500 kilometers, unrefueled and on autopilot -- violative of all of its obligations under 1441.

The linkages over the past ten years between Iraq's UAV program and biological and chemical warfare agents are of deep concern to us. Iraq could use these small UAVs which have a wingspan of only a few meters to deliver biological agents to its neighbors or, if transported, to other countries, including the United States.

My friends, the information I have presented to you about these terrible weapons and about Iraq's continued flaunting of its obligations under Security Council Resolution 1441 links to a subject I now want to spend a little bit of time on, and that has to do with terrorism.



Our concern is not just about these illicit weapons; it's the way that these illicit weapons can be connected to terrorists and terrorist organizations that have no compunction about using such devices against innocent people around the world.

Iraq and terrorism go back decades. Baghdad trains Palestine Liberation Front members in small arms and explosives. Saddam uses the Arab Liberation Front to funnel money to the families of Palestinian suicide bombers in order to prolong the Intifadah. And it's no secret that Saddam's own intelligence service was involved in dozens of attacks or attempted assassinations in the 1990s.

But what I want to bring to your attention today is the potentially much more sinister nexus between Iraq and the al-Qaida terrorist network, a nexus that combines classic terrorist organizations and modern methods of murder. Iraq today harbors a deadly terrorist network headed by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi an associate and collaborator of Usama bin Laden and his al-Qaida lieutenants.

Zarqawi, Palestinian born in Jordan, fought in the Afghan war more than a decade ago. Returning to Afghanistan in 2000, he oversaw a terrorist training camp. One of his specialties, and one of the specialties of this camp, is poisons.



When our coalition ousted the Taliban, the Zarqawi network helped establish another poison and explosive training center camp, and this camp is located in northeastern Iraq. You see a picture of this camp.

The network is teaching its operatives how to produce ricin and other poisons. Let me remind you how ricin works. Less than a pinch -- imagine a pinch of salt -- less than a pinch of ricin, eating just this amount in your food, would cause shock, followed by circulatory failure. Death comes within 72 hours and there is no antidote. There is no cure. It is fatal.



Those helping to run this camp are Zarqawi lieutenants operating in northern Kurdish areas outside Saddam Hussein's controlled Iraq. But Baghdad has an agent in the most senior levels of the radical organization Ansar al-Islam that controls this corner of Iraq. In 2000, this agent offered al-Qaida safe haven in the region.

After we swept al-Qaida from Afghanistan, some of those members accepted this safe haven. They remain there today.

Zarqawi's activities are not confined to this small corner of northeast Iraq. He traveled to Baghdad in May of 2002 for medical treatment, staying in the capital of Iraq for two months while he recuperated to fight another day.

During his stay, nearly two dozen extremists converged on Baghdad and established a base of operations there. These al-Qaida affiliates based in Baghdad now coordinate the movement of people, money and supplies into and throughout Iraq for his network, and they have now been operating freely in the capital for more than eight months.

Iraqi officials deny accusations of ties with al-Qaida. These denials are simply not credible. Last year, an al-Qaida associate bragged that the situation in Iraq was ""good,"" that Baghdad could be transited quickly.

We know these affiliates are connected to Zarqawi because they remain, even today, in regular contact with his direct subordinates, include the poison cell plotters. And they are involved in moving more than money and materiel. Last year, two suspected al-Qaida operatives were arrested crossing from Iraq into Saudi Arabia. They were linked to associates of the Baghdad cell and one of them received training in Afghanistan on how to use cyanide.

From his terrorist network in Iraq, Zarqawi can direct his network in the Middle East and beyond. We in the United States, all of us, the State Department and the Agency for International Development, we all lost a dear friend with the cold-blooded murder of Mr. Laurence Foley in Amman, Jordan, last October. A despicable act was committed that day, the assassination of an individual whose sole mission was to assist the people of Jordan. The captured assassin says his cell received money and weapons from Zarqawi for that murder. After the attack, an associate of the assassin left Jordan to go to Iraq to obtain weapons and explosives for further operations. Iraqi officials protest that they are not aware of the whereabouts of Zarqawi or of any of his associates. Again, these protests are not credible. We know of Zarqawi's activities in Baghdad. I described them earlier.

Now let me add one other fact. We asked a friendly security service to approach Baghdad about extraditing Zarqawi and providing information about him and his close associates. This service contacted Iraqi officials twice and we passed details that should have made it easy to find Zarqawi. The network remains in Baghdad. Zarqawi still remains at large, to come and go.



As my colleagues around this table and as the citizens they represent in Europe know, Zarqawi's terrorism is not confined to the Middle East. Zarqawi and his network have plotted terrorist actions against countries including France, Britain, Spain, Italy, Germany and Russia. According to detainees Abu Atiya, who graduated from Zarqawi's terrorist camp in Afghanistan, tasked at least nine North African extremists in 2001 to travel to Europe to conduct poison and explosive attacks.



Since last year, members of this network have been apprehended in France, Britain, Spain and Italy. By our last count, 116 operatives connected to this global web have been arrested. The chart you are seeing shows the network in Europe.

We know about this European network and we know about its links to Zarqawi because the detainees who provided the information about the targets also provided the names of members of the network. Three of those he identified by name were arrested in France last December. In the apartments of the terrorists, authorities found circuits for explosive devices and a list of ingredients to make toxins.

The detainee who helped piece this together says the plot also targeted Britain. Later evidence again proved him right. When the British unearthed the cell there just last month, one British police officer was murdered during the destruction of the cell.



We also know that Zarqawi's colleagues have been active in the Pankisi Gorge, Georgia, and in Chechnya, Russia. The plotting to which they are linked is not mere chatter. Members of Zarqawi's network say their goal was to kill Russians with toxins.

We are not surprised that Iraq is harboring Zarqawi and his subordinates. This understanding builds on decades-long experience with respect to ties between Iraq and al-Qaida. Going back to the early and mid-1990s when bin Laden was based in Sudan, an al-Qaida source tells us that Saddam and bin Laden reached an understanding that al-Qaida would no longer support activities against Baghdad. Early al-Qaida ties were forged by secret high-level intelligence service contacts with al-Qaida, secret Iraqi intelligence high-level contacts with al-Qaida.

We know members of both organizations met repeatedly and have met at least eight times at very senior levels since the early 1990s. In 1996, a foreign security service tells us that bin Laden met with a senior Iraqi intelligence official in Khartoum and later met the director of the Iraqi intelligence service.

Saddam became more interested as he saw al-Qaida's appalling attacks. A detained al-Qaida member tells us that Saddam was more willing to assist al-Qaida after the 1998 bombings of our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Saddam was also impressed by al-Qaida's attacks on the USS Cole in Yemen in October 2000.

Iraqis continue to visit bin Laden in his new home in Afghanistan. A senior defector, one of Saddam's former intelligence chiefs in Europe, says Saddam sent his agents to Afghanistan sometime in the mid-1990s to provide training to al-Qaida members on document forgery.

From the late 1990s until 2001, the Iraqi Embassy in Pakistan played the role of liaison to the al-Qaida organization.

Some believe, some claim, these contacts do not amount to much. They say Saddam Hussein's secular tyranny and al-Qaida's religious tyranny do not mix. I am not comforted by this thought. Ambition and hatred are enough to bring Iraq and al-Qaida together, enough so al-Qaida could learn how to build more sophisticated bombs and learn how to forge documents, and enough so that al-Qaida could turn to Iraq for help in acquiring expertise on weapons of mass destruction.

And the record of Saddam Hussein's cooperation with other Islamist terrorist organizations is clear. Hamas, for example, opened an office in Baghdad in 1999 and Iraq has hosted conferences attended by Palestine Islamic Jihad. These groups are at the forefront of sponsoring suicide attacks against Israel.

Al-Qaida continues to have a deep interest in acquiring weapons of mass destruction. As with the story of Zarqawi and his network, I can trace the story of a senior terrorist operative telling how Iraq provided training in these weapons to al-Qaida. Fortunately, this operative is now detained and he has told his story. I will relate it to you now as he, himself, described it.

This senior al-Qaida terrorist was responsible for one of al-Qaida's training camps in Afghanistan. His information comes firsthand from his personal involvement at senior levels of al-Qaida. He says bin Laden and his top deputy in Afghanistan, deceased al-Qaida leader Muhammad Atif, did not believe that al-Qaida labs in Afghanistan were capable enough to manufacture these chemical or biological agents. They needed to go somewhere else. They had to look outside of Afghanistan for help.

Where did they go? Where did they look? They went to Iraq. The support that this detainee describes included Iraq offering chemical or biological weapons training for two al-Qaida associates beginning in December 2000. He says that a militant known as Abdallah al-Iraqi had been sent to Iraq several times between 1997 and 2000 for help in acquiring poisons and gasses. Abdallah al-Iraqi characterized the relationship he forged with Iraqi officials as successful.

As I said at the outset, none of this should come as a surprise to any of us. Terrorism has been a tool used by Saddam for decades. Saddam was a supporter of terrorism long before these terrorist networks had a name, and this support continues. The nexus of poisons and terror is new. The nexus of Iraq and terror is old. The combination is lethal.

With this track record, Iraqi denials of supporting terrorism take their place alongside the other Iraqi denials of weapons of mass destruction. It is all a web of lies.

When we confront a regime that harbors ambitions for regional domination, hides weapons of mass destruction, and provides haven and active support for terrorists, we are not confronting the past; we are confronting the present. And unless we act, we are confronting an even more frightening future.



And, friends, this has been a long and a detailed presentation and I thank you for your patience, but there is one more subject that I would like to touch on briefly, and it should be a subject of deep and continuing concern to this Council: Saddam Hussein's violations of human rights.

Underlying all that I have said, underlying all the facts and the patterns of behavior that I have identified, is Saddam Hussein's contempt for the will of this Council, his contempt for the truth, and, most damning of all, his utter contempt for human life. Saddam Hussein's use of mustard and nerve gas against the Kurds in 1988 was one of the 20th century's most horrible atrocities. Five thousand men, women and children died. His campaign against the Kurds from 1987 to '89 included mass summary executions, disappearances, arbitrary jailing and ethnic cleansing, and the destruction of some 2,000 villages.

He has also conducted ethnic cleansing against the Shia Iraqis and the Marsh Arabs whose culture has flourished for more than a millennium. Saddam Hussein's police state ruthlessly eliminates anyone who dares to dissent. Iraq has more forced disappearance cases than any other country -- tens of thousands of people reported missing in the past decade.

Nothing points more clearly to Saddam Hussein's dangerous intentions and the threat he poses to all of us than his calculated cruelty to his own citizens and to his neighbors. Clearly, Saddam Hussein and his regime will stop at nothing until something stops him.





For more than 20 years, by word and by deed, Saddam Hussein has pursued his ambition to dominate Iraq and the broader Middle East using the only means he knows: intimidation, coercion and annihilation of all those who might stand in his way. For Saddam Hussein, possession of the world's most deadly weapons is the ultimate trump card, the one he must hold to fulfill his ambition.

We know that Saddam Hussein is determined to keep his weapons of mass destruction, is determined to make more. Given Saddam Hussein's history of aggression, given what we know of his grandiose plans, given what we know of his terrorist associations, and given his determination to exact revenge on those who oppose him, should we take the risk that he will not someday use these weapons at a time and a place and in a manner of his choosing, at a time when the world is in a much weaker position to respond?

The United States will not and cannot run that risk for the American people. Leaving Saddam Hussein in possession of weapons of mass destruction for a few more months or years is not an option, not in a post-September 11th world.

My colleagues, over three months ago, this Council recognized that Iraq continued to pose a threat to international peace and security, and that Iraq had been and remained in material breach of its disarmament obligations.

Today, Iraq still poses a threat and Iraq still remains in material breach. Indeed, by its failure to seize on its one last opportunity to come clean and disarm, Iraq has put itself in deeper material breach and closer to the day when it will face serious consequences for its continue defiance of this Council.

My colleagues, we have an obligation to our citizens. We have an obligation to this body to see that our resolutions are complied with. We wrote 1441 not in order to go to war. We wrote 1441 to try to preserve the peace. We wrote 1441 to give Iraq one last chance.

Iraq is not, so far, taking that one last chance.

We must not shrink from whatever is ahead of us. We must not fail in our duty and our responsibility to the citizens of the countries that are represented by this body.

Thank you, Mr. President.

Colin Powell,20030821,Interview With Vladimir Varfalomeyev at Ekho Moskvy Radio,"QUESTION: It is 9:22 a.m. in Moscow. Good morning. Here is Vladimir Varfolomeyev. I am glad to greet our guest from the United States, the Secretary of the State, Collin Powell. Hello, Mister Secretary. 
SECRETARY POWELL: Good morning. It is good to be back. 
QUESTION: We are glad to great you at this station again. It has become a good tradition to have you here during your visits to Moscow. You do not only have official negotiations but answer our questions and the questions of listeners. Taking into account that you came to Moscow from Tbilisi, our first questions are about Georgia. We know that yesterday you discussed this issue with President Putin and the Minister of Foreign Affairs Ivanov. Is it possible to tell now when the Russian military bases will be transferred from Georgia? As far as we know, this is one of the most serious questions. . 
SECRETARY POWELL: I cant answer that question. That is a matter for Russian authorities and the Georgian authorities to work out through discussions and negotiations over time. 
The U.S. position is that those forces should come out in accordance with the Istanbul commitments that the Russian Federation entered into in 1999. 
But I was impressed by the open attitude that President Putin had toward this question yesterday when we discussed it and I know that he and Foreign Minister Ivanov will be working with the new leadership of Georgia to come up with a solution to the situation. 
We wish the Georgian people all the best under their new leadership and the United States looks forward to cooperating with the Russian Federation in helping the Georgian people put in place a stable democracy. 
QUESTION: To help -- does this mean in the first place with funding, doesnt it? There was information in the media, referring to a representative of the State Department, that the United States is ready to provide a certain amount of money to speed up the process of Russian troop withdrawal. How much money are we talking about? . 
SECRETARY POWELL: So Georgia has many needs and we will be providing something in the neighborhood of $166 million in this fiscal year for the Georgians. And we have had some conversations with the Russian Federation about providing some financial assistance to assist in the transit of the forces out of the bases in Georgia and back into the Russian Federation, but there are no specific numbers that I could give you right now. 
QUESTION: There are many hot points in the world, and in some regions Russia and the United States cooperate. However, this does not apply to Iraq. As it is well known, our country did not send its troops to Iraq. But, as far as I understand from your yesterdays meetings in Moscow, both Putin and Ivanov appear to approve of the current mission of the United States in Iraq. Is it so? 
SECRETARY POWELL: Yes, we had a positive discussion about Iraq. There is no question that last year we had a serious disagreement. Russia did not support our military campaign in Iraq, but now we are cooperating to help the Iraqis build a democracy for themselves. Russia joined us in getting passage of U.N. Resolution 1511 which brought the International community back together. 
Russian firms are not working in Iraq under direct contracts with Iraqi companies and Iraq authorities. And we have had discussions with Russia about debt relief for Iraq. And I think there will be further contracting opportunities and sub-contracting opportunities for Russian firms in Iraq. 
QUESTION: Does this means, Mr. Secretary, that Russian oil companies will be allowed to work with Iraqi oil, to refining and selling? There was information that countries that did not support military operation, such as Russia, France and Germany, will get nothing in Iraq. 
SECRETARY POWELL: After we have transferred sovereignty back to the Ira q people, it will be up to the Iraqi government to determine what relations they will have with France, Germany and Russia, what economic opportunities those countries will have and what opportunities will exist for exploring for more oil or assisting the Iraqis in rebuilding their oil infrastructure. We are trying to look to the future and not the past. 
QUESTION: Concerning this, what is the American Government going to advise to the new powers in Iraq regarding the Russian companies? 
SECRETARY POWELL: America would always be available to provide advice to them, but we are waiting to put in place a transitional government next June. And then within a year after that, we would hope that the Iraqis would have had full elections for a new government, and we will wait for that new government to come into place and then discuss with them what positions they would like to take with respect to Russia or any other country. But it would be premature before that government is formed for me to suggest what they might decide or what they may agree to do. 
QUESTION: Have you discussed another difficult topic during the meeting that you had in Moscow  Iran and cooperation between Moscow and Teheran on nuclear issues. Were you able to reach a new point on this issue? 
SECRETARY POWELL: We had good discussions on the Russian civilian power plant program in Iran at Bushir. Both Russia and the United States are concerned about nuclear proliferation, and this is the area where we have been able to work with each other and with the International Atomic AgencyInternational Atomic Energy Agency- in order to get Iran to sign an additional protocol to the NPT. So I am pleased with the discussions we have had, and we have a mutual concern with respect to any proliferation activity anywhere in the world. 
QUESTION: I remind you that we have Secretary Colin Powell as our guest today. If you have a question, send them to our pager. I already have several of your questions that we got through Internet. Another issue, which is related to fighting against terrorism. They say that Osama Bin Laden is already captured, but will be shown to public only later, before the presidential elections. Is it true? 
SECRETARY POWELL: No, we do not have custody of Osama bin Laden. We are not holding him for an election surprise. [Laughter] If we had him, I can assure you, he would be shown to the world and he would be prosecuted. 
QUESTION: A question from one of our listeners, Kristina from Moscow. The obvious terror that Saddam Hussein supported in his country stopped only because of interference of other countries, and the United States in the first place. Now Moscow is destroying Chechnya with a silent agreement of the world community and the United States. Why you are not involved in this, asks Kristina. 
SECRETARY POWELL: Chechnya is a part of the Russian Federation and they are dealing with a difficult situation there. There are terrorists in Chechnya and we have said to our Russian colleagues that it is a problem they have to deal with. But we hope that they will work toward finding a political solution and that they will conduct their efforts in Chechnya in full consideration of their human rights and international obligations for the protection of human rights. But it is an internal matter for the Russian Federation to deal with. 
QUESTION: But what was happening in Iraq was its internal matter of Saddam Hussein, as well, wasnt it? Why did the United States interfere? 
SECRETARY POWELL: No because Iraq was subject to U.N. resolutions. Resolution after resolution that was passed over a period of twelve years demanding that Iraq come clean with respect to its weapons of mass destruction programs, that it stop abusing its people and to take other actions and Iraq continuously ignored the demands of the international community. And we were concerned about the weapons of mass destruction because they had used them against other nations and had used these weapons against their own people. 
QUESTION: But in the end, there was no weapons of mass destruction. 
SECRETARY POWELL: There were programs that were clearly intended to produce weapons of mass destruction. They had the intention to produce weapons of mass destruction. And we knew they had previously stockpiles. 
What we are now looking at to see whether there are still stockpiles and that is an open question. But that is why we have sent back a new Chief Inspector, Mr. Duelfer, who will be working with our experts in the area to completely look at all the sites that were there as well as examine all the documents and interview individuals to finally answer the question as to whether or not they had stockpiles. 
SECRETARY POWELL: Theres also no doubt in my mind that what Hussein was trying to do was to get the international community to stop looking at him, to get relief from all the sanctions so he could go back to his programs and develop these weapons. He never lost the intention to develop even more deadly weapons. But he is gone and the world doesnt have to worry about this anymore. 
QUESTION: Now, about some of our internal political problems. It is interesting to know your point of view. In yesterdays Izvestiya, you wrote about your first visit to the USSR many years ago the following: awful skills of the soviet regime to scare its own people and suppress any appearance of having a human spirit. Today, some people here say that those almost Stalins days are returning, and President Putting is slowly tightening the screws. (Literally: bolts) Do you agree with this? 
SECRETARY POWELL: No those days are not coming back, and I dont have the least concern about that, frankly. The Russian people now vote freely for who their leaders will be. 
We have expressed some concern to President Putin and Russian leaders that we believe that more open media, greater access to the media for people who are running for office and certain other actions that the Russian government has taken causes some concern and as friends we express that concern to our Russian colleagues. 
But when I think back over the thirty years I have been coming to Russia, what we have seen over the last fifteen years is a remarkable transformation to a democratic system of government where the people are able to vote and vote freely. But we think that more can be done here so that they have access to the information through a free media in order to make an informed choice. So I am not concerned about Russia returning to the old days from the Soviet Union, far from it. Russia has accomplished a great deal in recent years and the United States views Russia as a friend and a partner and wants to be helpful. 
SECRETARY POWELL: Most of my article in Izvestiya praised Russia for what it has accomplished, but as a friend we pointed out some area that is causing us some concern. This is how friends talk to one another. To show you how things have changed, in my own neighborhood back in the United States, the local gas station is owned by LUK Oil. Something that would have been unimaginable just a few years ago. 
QUESTION: You most likely wont see Yukos gas stations near your home, taking into account what is going on around this oil company, and its head, Mikhail Khodorkovskiy. They say in Kremlin, that it is a singular case and is not that important. Do you agree with that? 
SECRETARY POWELL: Well we are watching the case carefully and in my conversation with President Putin yesterday we talked about the need for full transparency and for those who have been accused of crimes to be dealt with in accordance with the law and acceptable rules of evidence and President Putin assured me that this case would be tried in that manner. 
QUESTION: I have several short questions. Several U.S. Congressmen suggested that Russia no longer be invited to G-8 summits. Taking into account that the U.S is going to host the summit this year, has the decision made about inviting President Putin to the summit. 
SECRETARY POWELL: Of course we would expect President Putin to be at the G8 Summit in the United States and to represent the Russian Federation. 
But the views expressed by those Congressmen reflect some of the concerns that I discussed with President Putin yesterday and were reflected in my Izvestiya article and that is why I felt it was important to raise these issues with the President. 
QUESTION: One other question which many of our listeners ask, for example, Svetlana by pager, what is the attitude of U. S. administration of weakening rate of the dollar? The dollar is not only a matter of paying but is a very serious factor of politics, not just internal politics but also external politics. Why is the value of the dollar falling? 
SECRETARY POWELL: The dollar is responding to financial market conditions and that is all I think I can say about it. As the Secretary of State, I have a very hard and fast rule, that I let the Secretary of Treasury make any comments that are going to be made about the position of the dollar. But I would say to your listeners - because I know it is a concern to them - that I consider the dollar to still be a good investment, but be patient. 
QUESTION: Do I understand correctly? That there are definitely meetings in the White House were this issue is discussed? That the U.S. administration is concerned that your currencys rate  and our ruble, not the European Euro  but yours is falling in value? 
SECRETARY POWELL: Well there are always conversations about how the exchange rate is moving and it either has the aspect of assisting exports or assisting imports, but let the markets do their work and the dollar tends to find its real value over time. 
QUESTION: Have you tried to exchange dollars to rubles here in Moscow? 
SECRETARY POWELL: I havent had the opportunity to do that or go shopping. I wish I did. [Laughter] 
QUESTION: Several more questions, in particular from Internet. Giorgi, from Tartamishin, but he states that he is from the United States. Is the U.S. going to return the base in Guantanamo to its legal owner, that is, to Cuba? And if so, when? 
SECRETARY POWELL: The base at Guantanamo is still under U.S. control and will remain so under arrangements previously entered into with Cuba. 
QUESTION: Does U.S. policy in general intend to widen its international, including military, presence? Recently, many in Moscow, among them diplomats, heard that there was information that the new U.S. base is going to be created very close to our borders, in Poland. You come to Moscow, and have conversations with President Putin as friends, but at the same time you encircle our country with new bases. 
SECRETARY POWELL: Let me start by saying that the number of troops that will be deployed in Europe will be going down, not up. And so we are trying to rearrange our presence in Europe to rationalize it in a better way.As part of that effort we may want to put some temporary facilities in some of the countries that used to be part of the Warsaw Pack, but these would not be big bases of the kind we had in Germany during the days of the Cold War. These might be small places where we could go and train for brief period of time or use air bases as access to get to dangerous places, crisis places, in Central Asia, Persian Gulf, Middle East. But it is not essentially moving our army closer to the Russian Federation and people should not see it in that light. The number of troops overall will be going down. Therefore, we are not trying to surround anyone. 
Let me put this in context because I hear this question all the time. Twelve years ago when I was head of the American Armed Forces, we had 315,000 troops in Europe. We started to draw down right after the end of the Cold War and we are going to well below 100,000. So nobody should be concerned that somehow the United States is building up its forces to be a threat to anyone or to surround any one. 
The Cold War is over. The Iron Curtain is down. Russia and the United States are now friends, not competitors or potential enemies and we should not see such things in old Cold War terms. 
QUESTION: Our time is almost over  last question. We know that yesterday, you discussed with Putin a joint space project, maybe about Mars. It is well know that the financial situation in our country is not really well. Can the United States help us with money? We have enough brains for it. 
SECRETARY POWELL: You do have an enormous technical capability to bring to the space program and as you know, we have cooperated in space and President Putin and I discussed this yesterday. I think there are new areas for cooperation, perhaps even in the new initiative that President Bush announced with respect to going to the moon and to Mars. But we are just beginning those discussions. I am confident that Russia will have a role to play. 
QUESTION: You are not going to give us any money, arent you? 
SECRETARY POWELL: Well, I cannot predict how much money might be available or how the money will be allocated. 
And the Budget Director gets very unhappy when I start to give away his money [laughter]. 
QUESTION: Thank you very much. This was the Secretary of State of the United States Collin Powell alive on Echo Moskvy. We are always glad to see you in Moscow and here in our station Ekho Moskvy. 

Released on January 27, 2004

SECRETARY POWELL: Good morning. It is good to be back.

QUESTION: We are glad to great you at this station again. It has become a good tradition to have you here during your visits to Moscow. You do not only have official negotiations but answer our questions and the questions of listeners. Taking into account that you came to Moscow from Tbilisi, our first questions are about Georgia.

And we have had some conversations with the Russian Federation about providing some financial assistance to assist in the transit of the forces out of the bases in Georgia and back into the Russian Federation, but there are no specific numbers that I could give you right now.

QUESTION: There are many hot points in the world, and in some regions Russia and the United States cooperate. However, this does not apply to Iraq. As it is well known, our country did not send its troops to Iraq. But, as far as I understand from your yesterdays meetings in Moscow, both Putin and Ivanov appear to approve of the current mission of the United States in Iraq. Is it so?

SECRETARY POWELL: Yes, we had a positive discussion about Iraq. There is no question that last year we had a serious disagreement. Russia did not support our military campaign in Iraq, but now we are cooperating to help the Iraqis build a democracy for themselves. Russia joined us in getting passage of U.N. Resolution 1511 which brought the International community back together.

Russian firms are not working in Iraq under direct contracts with Iraqi companies and Iraq authorities. And we have had discussions with Russia about debt relief for Iraq. And I think there will be further contracting opportunities and sub-contracting opportunities for Russian firms in Iraq.

QUESTION: Does this means, Mr. Secretary, that Russian oil companies will be allowed to work with Iraqi oil, to refining and selling? There was information that countries that did not support military operation, such as Russia, France and Germany, will get nothing in Iraq.

SECRETARY POWELL: After we have transferred sovereignty back to the Ira q people, it will be up to the Iraqi government to determine what relations they will have with France, Germany and Russia, what economic opportunities those countries will have and what opportunities will exist for exploring for more oil or assisting the Iraqis in rebuilding their oil infrastructure. We are trying to look to the future and not the past.

QUESTION: Concerning this, what is the American Government going to advise to the new powers in Iraq regarding the Russian companies?

SECRETARY POWELL: America would always be available to provide advice to them, but we are waiting to put in place a transitional government next June. And then within a year after that, we would hope that the Iraqis would have had full elections for a new government, and we will wait for that new government to come into place and then discuss with them what positions they would like to take with respect to Russia or any other country. But it would be premature before that government is formed for me to suggest what they might decide or what they may agree to do.

QUESTION: Have you discussed another difficult topic during the meeting that you had in Moscow  Iran and cooperation between Moscow and Teheran on nuclear issues. Were you able to reach a new point on this issue?

SECRETARY POWELL: We had good discussions on the Russian civilian power plant program in Iran at Bushir. Both Russia and the United States are concerned about nuclear proliferation, and this is the area where we have been able to work with each other and with the International Atomic AgencyInternational Atomic Energy Agency- in order to get Iran to sign an additional protocol to the NPT. So I am pleased with the discussions we have had, and we have a mutual concern with respect to any proliferation activity anywhere in the world.

QUESTION: I remind you that we have Secretary Colin Powell as our guest today. If you have a question, send them to our pager. I already have several of your questions that we got through Internet. Another issue, which is related to fighting against terrorism. They say that Osama Bin Laden is already captured, but will be shown to public only later, before the presidential elections. Is it true?

SECRETARY POWELL: No, we do not have custody of Osama bin Laden. We are not holding him for an election surprise. [Laughter] If we had him, I can assure you, he would be shown to the world and he would be prosecuted.

QUESTION: A question from one of our listeners, Kristina from Moscow. The obvious terror that Saddam Hussein supported in his country stopped only because of interference of other countries, and the United States in the first place. Now Moscow is destroying Chechnya with a silent agreement of the world community and the United States. Why you are not involved in this, asks Kristina.

SECRETARY POWELL: Chechnya is a part of the Russian Federation and they are dealing with a difficult situation there. There are terrorists in Chechnya and we have said to our Russian colleagues that it is a problem they have to deal with. But we hope that they will work toward finding a political solution and that they will conduct their efforts in Chechnya in full consideration of their human rights and international obligations for the protection of human rights. But it is an internal matter for the Russian Federation to deal with.

QUESTION: But what was happening in Iraq was its internal matter of Saddam Hussein, as well, wasnt it? Why did the United States interfere?

SECRETARY POWELL: No because Iraq was subject to U.N. resolutions. Resolution after resolution that was passed over a period of twelve years demanding that Iraq come clean with respect to its weapons of mass destruction programs, that it stop abusing its people and to take other actions and Iraq continuously ignored the demands of the international community. And we were concerned about the weapons of mass destruction because they had used them against other nations and had used these weapons against their own people.

QUESTION: But in the end, there was no weapons of mass destruction.

SECRETARY POWELL: There were programs that were clearly intended to produce weapons of mass destruction. They had the intention to produce weapons of mass destruction. And we knew they had previously stockpiles.

What we are now looking at to see whether there are still stockpiles and that is an open question. But that is why we have sent back a new Chief Inspector, Mr. Duelfer, who will be working with our experts in the area to completely look at all the sites that were there as well as examine all the documents and interview individuals to finally answer the question as to whether or not they had stockpiles.

SECRETARY POWELL: Theres also no doubt in my mind that what Hussein was trying to do was to get the international community to stop looking at him, to get relief from all the sanctions so he could go back to his programs and develop these weapons. He never lost the intention to develop even more deadly weapons. But he is gone and the world doesnt have to worry about this anymore.

QUESTION: Now, about some of our internal political problems. It is interesting to know your point of view. In yesterdays Izvestiya, you wrote about your first visit to the USSR many years ago the following: awful skills of the soviet regime to scare its own people and suppress any appearance of having a human spirit. Today, some people here say that those almost Stalins days are returning, and President Putting is slowly tightening the screws. (Literally: bolts) Do you agree with this?

SECRETARY POWELL: No those days are not coming back, and I dont have the least concern about that, frankly. The Russian people now vote freely for who their leaders will be.

We have expressed some concern to President Putin and Russian leaders that we believe that more open media, greater access to the media for people who are running for office and certain other actions that the Russian government has taken causes some concern and as friends we express that concern to our Russian colleagues.

But when I think back over the thirty years I have been coming to Russia, what we have seen over the last fifteen years is a remarkable transformation to a democratic system of government where the people are able to vote and vote freely. But we think that more can be done here so that they have access to the information through a free media in order to make an informed choice. So I am not concerned about Russia returning to the old days from the Soviet Union, far from it. Russia has accomplished a great deal in recent years and the United States views Russia as a friend and a partner and wants to be helpful.

SECRETARY POWELL: Most of my article in Izvestiya praised Russia for what it has accomplished, but as a friend we pointed out some area that is causing us some concern. This is how friends talk to one another. To show you how things have changed, in my own neighborhood back in the United States, the local gas station is owned by LUK Oil. Something that would have been unimaginable just a few years ago.

QUESTION: You most likely wont see Yukos gas stations near your home, taking into account what is going on around this oil company, and its head, Mikhail Khodorkovskiy. They say in Kremlin, that it is a singular case and is not that important. Do you agree with that?

SECRETARY POWELL: Well we are watching the case carefully and in my conversation with President Putin yesterday we talked about the need for full transparency and for those who have been accused of crimes to be dealt with in accordance with the law and acceptable rules of evidence and President Putin assured me that this case would be tried in that manner.

QUESTION: I have several short questions. Several U.S. Congressmen suggested that Russia no longer be invited to G-8 summits. Taking into account that the U.S is going to host the summit this year, has the decision made about inviting President Putin to the summit.

SECRETARY POWELL: Of course we would expect President Putin to be at the G8 Summit in the United States and to represent the Russian Federation.

But the views expressed by those Congressmen reflect some of the concerns that I discussed with President Putin yesterday and were reflected in my Izvestiya article and that is why I felt it was important to raise these issues with the President.

QUESTION: One other question which many of our listeners ask, for example, Svetlana by pager, what is the attitude of U. S. administration of weakening rate of the dollar? The dollar is not only a matter of paying but is a very serious factor of politics, not just internal politics but also external politics. Why is the value of the dollar falling?

SECRETARY POWELL: The dollar is responding to financial market conditions and that is all I think I can say about it. As the Secretary of State, I have a very hard and fast rule, that I let the Secretary of Treasury make any comments that are going to be made about the position of the dollar. But I would say to your listeners - because I know it is a concern to them - that I consider the dollar to still be a good investment, but be patient.

QUESTION: Do I understand correctly? That there are definitely meetings in the White House were this issue is discussed? That the U.S. administration is concerned that your currencys rate  and our ruble, not the European Euro  but yours is falling in value?

SECRETARY POWELL: Well there are always conversations about how the exchange rate is moving and it either has the aspect of assisting exports or assisting imports, but let the markets do their work and the dollar tends to find its real value over time.

QUESTION: Have you tried to exchange dollars to rubles here in Moscow?

SECRETARY POWELL: I havent had the opportunity to do that or go shopping. I wish I did. [Laughter]

QUESTION: Several more questions, in particular from Internet. Giorgi, from Tartamishin, but he states that he is from the United States. Is the U.S. going to return the base in Guantanamo to its legal owner, that is, to Cuba? And if so, when?

SECRETARY POWELL: The base at Guantanamo is still under U.S. control and will remain so under arrangements previously entered into with Cuba.

QUESTION: Does U.S. policy in general intend to widen its international, including military, presence? Recently, many in Moscow, among them diplomats, heard that there was information that the new U.S. base is going to be created very close to our borders, in Poland. You come to Moscow, and have conversations with President Putin as friends, but at the same time you encircle our country with new bases.

SECRETARY POWELL: Let me start by saying that the number of troops that will be deployed in Europe will be going down, not up. And so we are trying to rearrange our presence in Europe to rationalize it in a better way.As part of that effort we may want to put some temporary facilities in some of the countries that used to be part of the Warsaw Pack, but these would not be big bases of the kind we had in Germany during the days of the Cold War. These might be small places where we could go and train for brief period of time or use air bases as access to get to dangerous places, crisis places, in Central Asia, Persian Gulf, Middle East. But it is not essentially moving our army closer to the Russian Federation and people should not see it in that light. The number of troops overall will be going down. Therefore, we are not trying to surround anyone.

Let me put this in context because I hear this question all the time. Twelve years ago when I was head of the American Armed Forces, we had 315,000 troops in Europe. We started to draw down right after the end of the Cold War and we are going to well below 100,000. So nobody should be concerned that somehow the United States is building up its forces to be a threat to anyone or to surround any one.

The Cold War is over. The Iron Curtain is down. Russia and the United States are now friends, not competitors or potential enemies and we should not see such things in old Cold War terms.

QUESTION: Our time is almost over  last question. We know that yesterday, you discussed with Putin a joint space project, maybe about Mars. It is well know that the financial situation in our country is not really well. Can the United States help us with money? We have enough brains for it.

SECRETARY POWELL: You do have an enormous technical capability to bring to the space program and as you know, we have cooperated in space and President Putin and I discussed this yesterday. I think there are new areas for cooperation, perhaps even in the new initiative that President Bush announced with respect to going to the moon and to Mars. But we are just beginning those discussions. I am confident that Russia will have a role to play.

QUESTION: You are not going to give us any money, arent you?

SECRETARY POWELL: Well, I cannot predict how much money might be available or how the money will be allocated.

And the Budget Director gets very unhappy when I start to give away his money [laughter].

QUESTION: Thank you very much. This was the Secretary of State of the United States Collin Powell alive on Echo Moskvy. We are always glad to see you in Moscow and here in our station Ekho Moskvy.



",https://web.archive.org/web/20030821054856/https://2001-2009.state.gov/secretary/former/powell/remarks/28522.htm
Colin Powell,20030620,U.S. Policy on Chechnya,"Chairman Nighthorse Campbell, Co-Chairman Smith and CSCE commissioners, thank you for the invitation to speak today on Chechnya. The Administration welcomes this opportunity to discuss U.S. policy on Chechnya and the events of the past several months.
As you all know, the current conflict in Chechnya in a few months will begin its third year. Coming on the heels of the first conflict in Chechnya from 1994-1996, this latest conflict has dragged on nearly twice as long but with a similarly tragic price in human lives, peoples homes, and Chechen society. The casualties mount every day -- for both sides, Chechen and Russian alike -- and the pain and suffering of innocent civilians resulting from the fighting see no end in sight. There are few places in the world that have borne such devastation as Chechnya. Continuation of the conflict not only constitutes a drain on Russian development and a living nightmare for innocent Chechens, but it poses a threat to the entire Caucasus region.
Sadly, this tragic situation shows no signs of ending soon. The fighting goes on. Russian forces conduct sweeps, sealing towns and villages and searching house to house for fighters. Often these sweeps are subsequently followed by reports of the beatings and torture of civilians, of extortion, or the disappearances of young men. Russian convoys are ambushed daily by Chechen fighters using landmines, and Russian blockposts or administrative buildings are often attacked in hit-and-run raids. Pro-Moscow Chechen administrators are assassinated. The economy is in shambles. Housing and infrastructure are destroyed, especially in Grozny where thousands still live, struggling from day to day in the most difficult conditions.
The United States Government is committed to doing all that we can to bring about an end to this conflict and to relieve the suffering of the civilian population. Through our humanitarian assistance programs and our diplomatic efforts, the United States remains engaged on Chechnya.
Our objectives for Chechnya today are the same as they have been in the past. We seek a political settlement that will end the fighting, promote reconciliation, and recognize the territorial integrity of the Russian Federation. We also seek accountability for human rights abuses committed by all sides, and unimpeded access to the displaced by humanitarian organizations. As we have always done, we are working toward these objectives in our on-going discussions with the Russian Government, in concert with our friends and allies, and in partnership with international and non-governmental organizations.
A Political Settlement
On September 24, 2001 President Putin made a speech describing Russian readiness to assist the United States in the war on terrorism in the aftermath of September 11. But he went further on Chechnya, drawing a distinction between the ""historic roots"" of the conflict in Chechnya and the presence of foreign terrorists. We saw in this distinction the basis for the possibility that talks could begin. We were thus pleased when on September 25 Chechen leader Maskhadov welcomed President Putin's speech and opened the door for a political dialogue.
After weeks of jockeying and phone contacts, a face-to-face meeting between a Russian Government official and a Chechen representative took place in late November. Unfortunately, there have been no meetings to follow up on that, and we understand that contacts have been suspended. But as have said repeatedly, a political settlement is the only way that this conflict can be ended, peace and stability can be returned to Chechnya and the process of rebuilding can be started. Russian Government officials have noted progress in re-establishing government structures and say they are working toward ""normalizing"" the situation. Without some settlement with those forces engaged in the fighting, however, we do not believe this will be enough to end the fighting.
Clearly, the causes and motivations of Chechens fighting the Russians differ. There are those who see this as a struggle to protect their homeland. And there are others in Chechnya who have been linked to international terrorist circles.
We do not ask the Russian Government to try to reach accord with terrorists. But we do believe that there are those with whom discussions can be undertaken, such as Mr. Maskhadov -- a leader who has sufficient credibility with the broader Chechen population to speak for them in a political dialogue with Moscow. We intend to continue to make this point to the Russian Government, as we have consistently in the past, and we encourage our allies to do so as well. We hope that contacts will be resumed in the near future. However, while we see some indications of interest on the Russian side in launching a dialogue, we are not able to offer a reliable prediction as to when Russian-Chechen political contacts might be resumed.
At the same time, we have called on Mr. Maskhadov and other moderate Chechens to disassociate themselves with terrorists. Contrary to some media reporting, we have not seen evidence of extensive ties between Chechens and Al-Qaida in Chechnya, but we have seen evidence of individuals or certain factions linked to terrorist elements. A clear demonstration by Mr. Maskhadov that he does not maintain such ties is appropriate as a gesture to show he is a credible interlocutor for the Russians. And we intend to continue to make that point to the Chechens as well.
We have taken action on this point. Some Chechen forces with links to international terrorists are supported through groups operating in the Pankisi Gorge in Georgia, which borders Chechnya. Last fall, Russian aircraft conducted several air strikes against the Pankisi Gorge. While we agree that the Russians have a legitimate concern, we have urged them not to take action themselves. Instead, we are working with President Shevardnadze and the Georgian Government to train and equip Georgian military units, so that Georgia will have the capacity to deal with this problem itself.
Despite the death of field commander Khattab, an Arab linked to terrorists and commander of the foreign mujahidin in Chechnya, and the rumored death of field commander Shamil Basayev, another of those linked to terrorists, the conflict is likely to continue at its present level. We believe that more than one thousand Chechen fighters remain. The Chechens' ability to recruit new fighters is aided in part by the animosity created by the harsh tactics of Russian security forces. As we have said repeatedly and continue to believe, there is no military solution to this conflict.
The Humanitarian Situation
An estimated 300,000 Chechens have been displaced by the fighting. More than half of the displaced -- 160,000 -- remain in Chechnya. The displaced account for more a third of Chechnya's estimated population of 440,000. Of the rest, the largest concentration is in Ingushetiya, with others in Dagestan and other areas of Russia, or in Georgia, Azerbaijan or Kazakhstan. The United Nations estimates that 140,000 Chechens are in Ingushetiya now, and 65 percent of them are living in private homes, with relatives or others who would take them in. The rest live in camps or spontaneous settlements. These people are largely dependent on aid provided by the international community.
The United States has been the largest single provider of humanitarian aid to the North Caucasus. Since 1999 we have contributed more than 30 million dollars, an amount that is roughly a quarter of all aid given under the United Nation's consolidated humanitarian appeals. In FY2001, the United States contributed a total of 22.1 million dollars to the United Nations and its agencies, to the International Committee of the Red Cross, and non-governmental organizations. Included in that sum is 9.6 million dollars of monies earmarked by Congress for American non-governmental organizations to carry out projects in the region.
Much of contribution has been in the form of food aid, such as wheat, flour and cooking oil. In FY2001, our funds helped feed 335,000 people. Our contributions also have funded much needed emergency health care, water and sanitation projects, education and shelter, as well as mine awareness programs. All of our contributions, except earmarked funds, are provided directly to the UN and the Red Cross for distribution through their agencies and implementing partners.
Beyond our contributions, we have assigned a refugee coordinator to our Embassy in Moscow who works with the international community and Russian officials in the delivery of our humanitarian assistance and reporting on further needs. The coordinator is a liaison with international and non-governmental organizations working in the field and federal and local governments. The coordinator also serves to monitor the situation on the ground, to observe the plight of the displaced and to identify where U.S. assistance programs should best be targeted.
In the North Caucasus, the security situation makes access to the region difficult. As you may know, there is a ban on U.S. Government personnel traveling to the region without the specific permission of the U.S. Ambassador to Russia. But the priority we place on the humanitarian situation has required that we send our refugee coordinator to the region on several trips.
Our policy has emphasized that humanitarian organizations be given the necessary, unimpeded access to the region to reach the displaced. The Russian Government has generally provided this access for the delivery of relief, but there have been occasional problems with changing administrative requirements and lack of coordination by Russian federal authorities and the local Chechen administration. The security situation in Chechnya makes delivery of humanitarian assistance particularly difficult, however.
We have also stressed in our discussions with the Russian Government that the return of the displaced to Chechnya be voluntary. Russian authorities have assured us that is the case, but the local pro-Moscow Chechen administration has undertaken a campaign to convince the displaced to return. As long as the security situation shows no improvement, however, most will not. In addition, Moscow has cut payments to the government of Ingushetiya that had been used to support benefits to displaced Chechens. The cuts in food and other programs in Ingushetiya create pressure on Chechens to return despite the risky security situation. Finally, the Russian government has suspended registration of new displaced persons in Ingushetiya since February 2001, making new arrivals ineligible for social benefits  food, housing, even education for their children.
Human Rights
The danger to civilians in Chechnya remains our greatest concern. The human rights situation is poor, with a history of abuses by all sides and little or no accountability by either. As we discuss in detail in our most recent human rights report, and as both Russian and international human rights NGOs have reported, civilians in Grozny and other towns and villages in areas where there is rebel activity are subject to security sweeps, or zachistki, by Russian forces.
These sweeps may be planned or occur spontaneously if Russian troops in the area are attacked. The result is that the village is sealed off and troops conduct house to house searches, checking identity documents. Usually, these sweeps are swiftly followed by new reports of serious human rights abuses, such as summary execution, arbitrary detention, torture, beatings, or extortion. Frequently, some of those taken into detention disappear, and sometimes their bodies are found days later. There are reports of rape. According to the Russian human rights group Memorial, at least 600 people have disappeared since the conflict began, although Russian official statistics put the total reports of disappearances between 1,200 and 2,000.
Russian officials have acknowledged that Russian soldiers have committed crimes against civilians, but investigations and prosecutions have not kept pace with the scope of the human rights violations that have been reported. Russian commanders in Chechnya have issued orders intended to prevent these abuses. Under these orders, sweeps may only be conducted with the permission of the Russian commander in Chechnya, General Moltenskoi. Vehicles are to be clearly marked, and troops are to identify themselves before entering homes. Masks are not to be worn. Lists of detainees are to be circulated to local civilian administrators. But it appears that these orders have not been effectively implemented. Much more needs to be done to instill discipline in Russian security forces, to prevent abuses, and to prosecute those who commit them.
Publicly and privately, we have made this point to the Russian Government at all levels. As the Secretary said in his recent testimony before House and Senate, ""We have not forgotten about Russian abuses of human rights. We raise Chechnya at every opportunity."" The conduct of Russian forces in Chechnya must be improved. That is why we again supported the resolution on Chechnya before the United Nations Commission on Human Rights this year. The rights of the civilian population must be respected. In his recent State of the Federation speech, President Putin said that ""Everyone resident in Chechnya or originally from there must feel they are full citizens of the Russian Federation.""
The Chechen fighters are not without blame. There have been repeated attacks on local officials who work for the pro-Moscow Chechen Administration. The landmines and other explosives fighters have used against convoys have also wounded, maimed or killed innocent civilians. There are other reports of kidnapping and execution of Russian prisoners held hostage. Chechen fighters must also be held to account.
Chechnya and U.S.-Russian Relations
Russia is cooperating with us in the war on terrorism, and we are embarked on building a new, more cooperative bilateral relationship. President Putin has made clear that he sees a partnership with the United States and the West as the best course for Russia. President Bush has made clear that partnership with Russia is in our interest.
In just two weeks, Presidents Bush and Putin will meet in Moscow to discuss how to further strengthen relations between our two countries. We hope that they will be able to record concrete progress on a number of parts of the bilateral agenda, including security issues, economic relations and people-to-people exchanges.
As part of this new relationship, however, there remain issues on which we disagree. Chechnya is one of those issues, and it is an issue that we have raised regularly and candidly with the Russians. President Bush discussed it with President Putin in November, as did Secretary Powell with President Putin in Moscow in December. In the last two weeks, Chechnya has figured prominently on the agenda during Deputy Secretary Armitage's discussions in Moscow with Deputy Foreign Minister Trubnikov and during the meeting last Friday between Secretary Powell and Foreign Minister Ivanov. As we embrace this opportunity we now have to build a stronger relationship with Russia, we do so without compromising our principles and commitments to promote peace and the strengthening of human rights in Chechnya.

Chairman Nighthorse Campbell, Co-Chairman Smith and CSCE commissioners, thank you for the invitation to speak today on Chechnya. The Administration welcomes this opportunity to discuss U.S. policy on Chechnya and the events of the past several months.

As you all know, the current conflict in Chechnya in a few months will begin its third year.

The United States has been the largest single provider of humanitarian aid to the North Caucasus. Since 1999 we have contributed more than 30 million dollars, an amount that is roughly a quarter of all aid given under the United Nation's consolidated humanitarian appeals. In FY2001, the United States contributed a total of 22.1 million dollars to the United Nations and its agencies, to the International Committee of the Red Cross, and non-governmental organizations. Included in that sum is 9.6 million dollars of monies earmarked by Congress for American non-governmental organizations to carry out projects in the region.

Much of contribution has been in the form of food aid, such as wheat, flour and cooking oil. In FY2001, our funds helped feed 335,000 people. Our contributions also have funded much needed emergency health care, water and sanitation projects, education and shelter, as well as mine awareness programs. All of our contributions, except earmarked funds, are provided directly to the UN and the Red Cross for distribution through their agencies and implementing partners.

Beyond our contributions, we have assigned a refugee coordinator to our Embassy in Moscow who works with the international community and Russian officials in the delivery of our humanitarian assistance and reporting on further needs. The coordinator is a liaison with international and non-governmental organizations working in the field and federal and local governments. The coordinator also serves to monitor the situation on the ground, to observe the plight of the displaced and to identify where U.S. assistance programs should best be targeted.

In the North Caucasus, the security situation makes access to the region difficult. As you may know, there is a ban on U.S. Government personnel traveling to the region without the specific permission of the U.S. Ambassador to Russia. But the priority we place on the humanitarian situation has required that we send our refugee coordinator to the region on several trips.

Our policy has emphasized that humanitarian organizations be given the necessary, unimpeded access to the region to reach the displaced. The Russian Government has generally provided this access for the delivery of relief, but there have been occasional problems with changing administrative requirements and lack of coordination by Russian federal authorities and the local Chechen administration. The security situation in Chechnya makes delivery of humanitarian assistance particularly difficult, however.

We have also stressed in our discussions with the Russian Government that the return of the displaced to Chechnya be voluntary. Russian authorities have assured us that is the case, but the local pro-Moscow Chechen administration has undertaken a campaign to convince the displaced to return. As long as the security situation shows no improvement, however, most will not. In addition, Moscow has cut payments to the government of Ingushetiya that had been used to support benefits to displaced Chechens. The cuts in food and other programs in Ingushetiya create pressure on Chechens to return despite the risky security situation. Finally, the Russian government has suspended registration of new displaced persons in Ingushetiya since February 2001, making new arrivals ineligible for social benefits  food, housing, even education for their children.

Human Rights

The danger to civilians in Chechnya remains our greatest concern. The human rights situation is poor, with a history of abuses by all sides and little or no accountability by either. As we discuss in detail in our most recent human rights report, and as both Russian and international human rights NGOs have reported, civilians in Grozny and other towns and villages in areas where there is rebel activity are subject to security sweeps, or zachistki, by Russian forces.

These sweeps may be planned or occur spontaneously if Russian troops in the area are attacked. The result is that the village is sealed off and troops conduct house to house searches, checking identity documents. Usually, these sweeps are swiftly followed by new reports of serious human rights abuses, such as summary execution, arbitrary detention, torture, beatings, or extortion. Frequently, some of those taken into detention disappear, and sometimes their bodies are found days later. There are reports of rape. According to the Russian human rights group Memorial, at least 600 people have disappeared since the conflict began, although Russian official statistics put the total reports of disappearances between 1,200 and 2,000.

Russian officials have acknowledged that Russian soldiers have committed crimes against civilians, but investigations and prosecutions have not kept pace with the scope of the human rights violations that have been reported. Russian commanders in Chechnya have issued orders intended to prevent these abuses. Under these orders, sweeps may only be conducted with the permission of the Russian commander in Chechnya, General Moltenskoi. Vehicles are to be clearly marked, and troops are to identify themselves before entering homes. Masks are not to be worn. Lists of detainees are to be circulated to local civilian administrators. But it appears that these orders have not been effectively implemented. Much more needs to be done to instill discipline in Russian security forces, to prevent abuses, and to prosecute those who commit them.

Publicly and privately, we have made this point to the Russian Government at all levels. As the Secretary said in his recent testimony before House and Senate, ""We have not forgotten about Russian abuses of human rights. We raise Chechnya at every opportunity."" The conduct of Russian forces in Chechnya must be improved. That is why we again supported the resolution on Chechnya before the United Nations Commission on Human Rights this year. The rights of the civilian population must be respected. In his recent State of the Federation speech, President Putin said that ""Everyone resident in Chechnya or originally from there must feel they are full citizens of the Russian Federation.""

The Chechen fighters are not without blame. There have been repeated attacks on local officials who work for the pro-Moscow Chechen Administration. The landmines and other explosives fighters have used against convoys have also wounded, maimed or killed innocent civilians. There are other reports of kidnapping and execution of Russian prisoners held hostage. Chechen fighters must also be held to account.

Chechnya and U.S.-Russian Relations

Russia is cooperating with us in the war on terrorism, and we are embarked on building a new, more cooperative bilateral relationship. President Putin has made clear that he sees a partnership with the United States and the West as the best course for Russia. President Bush has made clear that partnership with Russia is in our interest.

In just two weeks, Presidents Bush and Putin will meet in Moscow to discuss how to further strengthen relations between our two countries. We hope that they will be able to record concrete progress on a number of parts of the bilateral agenda, including security issues, economic relations and people-to-people exchanges.

As part of this new relationship, however, there remain issues on which we disagree. Chechnya is one of those issues, and it is an issue that we have raised regularly and candidly with the Russians. President Bush discussed it with President Putin in November, as did Secretary Powell with President Putin in Moscow in December. In the last two weeks, Chechnya has figured prominently on the agenda during Deputy Secretary Armitage's discussions in Moscow with Deputy Foreign Minister Trubnikov and during the meeting last Friday between Secretary Powell and Foreign Minister Ivanov. As we embrace this opportunity we now have to build a stronger relationship with Russia, we do so without compromising our principles and commitments to promote peace and the strengthening of human rights in Chechnya.

Colin Powell,20020926,Press Briefing Aboard Aircraft En Route To Shanghai,"SECRETARY POWELL: Who wants first?
QUESTION: (Inaudible.)
SECRETARY POWELL: I have been talking with my staff back in Washington and they have been in touch with both sides. The Palestinian Authority put out a strong statement condemning the assassination. At the time they put it out it was still an assassination attempt because the minister hadnt died but he has subsequently died. So, it is a very serious situation and Ill make additional calls when I land. Our Consul General in Jerusalem is in direct touch as well as Ambassador Kurtzer. My staff is following it in Washington. I have been in touch with some foreign leaders already  Minister Fischer. Ill be doing more calls when I get on the ground.
QUESTION: (Inaudible.)
SECRETARY POWELL: Well, Ill wait and see. Ill get on the ground and get recommendations from my staff, get the state of play and then Ill make my judgments.
QUESTION: Are you hoping to close a deal with the Russians on this trip on ABM amendments so that it can get done before the two presidents meet?
SECRETARY POWELL: I think were going to have good discussions and a number of things have been teed up for my conversations with Igor Ivanov tomorrow night and for the presidents conversations with Mr. Putin on Sunday, but I would not expect that we would arrive at closure on the strategic framework issues on this trip. But, certainly, well be moving the ball quite a bit further down the field before approaching Crawford in about three weeks time, I guess or almost a month later. 
QUESTION: Could you say anything about what is teed up? What do you mean by --
SECRETARY POWELL: We have had a number of meetings and exchanges with the Russians on the strategic framework and the issues within the strategic framework. I dont have anything that I want to announce tonight or say tonight with respect to what they may be talking about on Sunday which you will hear from them.
QUESTION: We know that the last meeting with the Chinese was disappointing on proliferation issues. Are you going to be talking with them on this? And, how do you expect to push them on this issue without their going to be a little bit more productive on this ahead of the Presidents visit there?
SECRETARY POWELL: Her question has to do principally with the November agreement of last year, and we have been in discussions with the Chinese ever since my visit. Now what needs to be done to satisfy that agreement, the grandfathering issue, the issue of export controls, and the issue having to do with our ability to waive certain sanctions in order for them to go forward with the satellite purchases. We have not received satisfaction and, in fact, as a result of that we imposed sanctions on one of their companies, as you recall, SEMAC, a few weeks back. There has been no additional progress, and I am sure its something that I will find time to discuss with my Chinese colleagues.
QUESTION: (Inaudible.)
SECRETARY POWELL: We talked about it before and sometimes you just keep working on a problem, keep chipping away and ultimately you hope that you arrive at a solution. So, well keep working on it but we have not abandoned the position that we have taken because we think that the elements in an agreement are important. If they want to move forward with respect to that kind of technology from us those conditions have to be met.
QUESTION: What concrete steps do you hope will come out of tomorrows terrorism roundtable among APEC foreign ministers?
SECRETARY POWELL: I think we will have a good breakfast discussion, and then as you know statements are being prepared for the leaders. I think well come out with a pretty strong joint statement that will reflect the cohesion of the coalition, that it is standing together in this time of crisis. I have detected no weakening in the political commitment that leaders have made. I think that the discussions at APEC both at ministerial and at leaders level will reflect that and will be reflected in the statements that will come out. 
QUESTION: Just to follow up, what will you be looking for in terms of contributions to the campaign against terrorism and also toward a future in Afghanistan?
SECRETARY POWELL: As you know, every nation is making a contribution in a way that is appropriate for them. In some cases it is just diplomatic and political support and in other cases its a contribution of military forces. The Australians made a very strong statement by their commitment of military forces which Prime Minister Howard, I think it was yesterday or today, I cant recall, Im losing what day we are in. 
Most of the arrangements that we make like that are bilateral or within the NATO context. I dont know that we have any specific requests to put before any of the nations that will be here that we have not already put before them. Im not expecting any significant additional announcements of troop contributions or other elements of support that we are not already aware of, but my Pentagon colleagues are hard at work while I have been traveling through south Asia. If something comes up I will be sure to let you know.
QUESTION: Arent these statements already done? So what do you talk about? Similar to OAS and UN, etc?
SECRETARY POWELL: No, you would be surprised. You can get very intense discussions on the statement and whether or not someone wants to make a modification or a change to the statement. Most of the diplomatic conferences Ive gone to involve not the whole statement, but a sentence in the statement or a word in the statement or the shaping of a statement. I think well have a chance to talk.
QUESTION: So youre heading to East Asia. Months ago you were very confident that North Korea would come around, that you would open discussions with them. That was more than four months ago. Do you expect that the issue will come up? And, what do you suppose is going through the North Korean minds these days in four months without a response.
SECRETARY POWELL: I think eventually the North Koreans will respond in a way that will allow us to go forward because I dont think they have any other choice or future. Their economy doesnt get any better. Their agricultural situation doesnt get any better. I cannot predict when they will make that decision and I cannot pretend to get inside the mind of the leadership circle or the mind of Kim Jong Il. So we will have to wait and see. 
I think perhaps the events of the 11th of September have caused them to slow down their decision process. As you know, they are on a list of states that sponsor terrorism and I think things were slowed down by the events of the 11th of September. I will look forward to the discussions that the President will have with President Kim Dae Jung. Maybe we will get some better insight into North Korean thinking. As you know, they have also pulled back on some of the commitments they have made to the South Koreans with respect to travel back and forth. There is something churning going on. 
In dealing with the North Koreans its going to be a long-term, slow process but I think it has to move in a positive direction because of the severe needs that exist within that country.
QUESTION: On a step from A to Z, if A in Afghanistan is this political vacuum that you fear and Z is some sort of functioning parliament, whatever broad-based government you form, Id like to know what youre thinking about how you get from A to Z?
SECRETARY POWELL: We may see a political vacuum immediately or sort of a deteriorating situation that leads to a political vacuum. And I think what you are going to need, as I said before, is some sort of broad-based assemblage of individuals and leaders representing all aspects of Afghan society who will come together with a common purpose and perhaps using the position of the king as a rallying point and, from that, let them come up with some ideas of how they wish to be governed in the future. Then use the United Nations as the facilitating body that will help them go back into the country. Provide a sense of order and have the UN perhaps perform some interim role as they are organizing themselves and gathering their strength and developing the capability they need to govern themselves. 
Its not something that the United States or any other nation is going to be able to dictate. I think its something that we have to help them with, something that we have to help them get organized, support, and use international bodies as has been used in the past in other situations, Cambodia, East Timor, not that those are models. This one is rather unique. The UN has experience in doing this kind of thing and Mr. Brahimi is quite experienced in this regard as well.
QUESTION: On Chechnya, there have been a number of interesting statements, ambivalent developments in the past few weeks. What do you expect you will be saying to Igor Ivanov tomorrow evening about Chechnya?
SECRETARY POWELL: I think we will be encouraging them as we have in the past to seek a political solution, to move aggressively toward a political solution and to not think that it can be solved militarily. Once again to recognize that even though we are anxious to work with them and we recognize that they have to fight terrorist activities in Chechnya, they have to do it in a way that reflects a solid consideration of human rights and accountability for past atrocities that we know took place. Not every Chechen who is in a resistance mode is necessarily a terrorist. We have to make some distinctions and judgments and ultimately the only way it can be sorted out and brought to ground is with a political solution. 
QUESTION: You leave South Asia having wrapped up the framework for opposed help on government. What happens next in specific terms? And, secondly, now can you reflect a little bit on Iran and say that they will be part of the coalition or help you and the fact that you know have all the countries around Afghanistan playing a set role?
SECRETARY POWELL: What was the first question? You know, the military campaign will continue, and we hope that all the pressure that is being brought to bear on the Taliban will produce results as soon as possible. 
QUESTION: Whats next for you to do?
SECRETARY POWELL: For me to do? We are pushing in on all fronts. We are working on the military campaign. Im continuing to work with coalition members to see if there are more things that they can do and to encourage them to remain steadfast and they are doing so. I will be also working with the United Nations with respect to the question asked earlier about how we create a grouping that can come together. I will be spending time on the humanitarian issue because winter is approaching. Ramadan is approaching. Also, thinking not just about humanitarian relief but beyond that, the rebuilding of Afghanistan. Helping these people to reconstruct a life for themselves. This isnt the United States going in and nation-building with troops. This is helping the international community helping the people of Afghanistan to create hopeful conditions within the country so that they are not vulnerable to this kind of a threat again in the future.
QUESTION: What about Iran?
SECRETARY POWELL: Iran has always been hostile toward the Taliban and as you know we have been in touch with them through various channels and we are exchanging some ideas and information. I think you saw an administration spokesman indicate that they have even indicated to us that they would be willing to perform and ready to perform search and rescue missions. I dont think that will become necessary because I cant envision us needing it in that part of the theater but that was an interesting statement on their part. 
When you go from Iran and clockwise around Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Pakistan and come all the way around, they are surrounded with no friends in that surrounding neighborhood as my Indian colleague liked to call it. I think this has been putting incredible pressure on this regime. We are going after their money. It will be hard to find it all but Im sure thats having an effect already. They are being subjected to a military campaign and well just keep squeezing.
QUESTION: Are there examples of what the UN has been able to do in the past?
SECRETARY POWELL: East Timor and Cambodia are examples of what the UN has done in the past but I would not say that is a model that you would say, I would use the Cambodian model or the East Timoran model in Afghanistan. I think it is quite different. It shows, East Timor, Cambodia, or you can go to Bosnia or Kosovo, you can look at all of the previous examples. 
The UN has quite a great deal of experience in going in and helping with this kind of a situation. Cambodia, they went into absolute chaos. They had a king. I dont want to give you the impression that we are going to take the Cambodian model because there was a king there and there is a king here, and therefore thats the model. Im just saying there are examples of the UN having successfully done this kind of thing in the past, and therefore they bring qualifications to this kind of situation to do it again in the future. Im not suggesting that any one of the countries I mentioned is a model for Afghanistan. 
QUESTION: (Inaudible.)
SECRETARY POWELL: I think there probably will be a role for peacekeepers of some kind and that is part of our discussions.

SECRETARY POWELL: Who wants first?

QUESTION: (Inaudible.)

SECRETARY POWELL: I have been talking with my staff back in Washington and they have been in touch with both sides. The Palestinian Authority put out a strong statement condemning the assassination.

Colin Powell,20030709,A Strategy of Partnerships,"Broad and Deep 
When most people think about U.S. foreign policy these days, they think first and sometimes only about aspects of the war on terrorism: the Reconstruction of Iraq and Afghanistan, the troubles of the Middle East, and the terror cells lurking in Southeast Asia, Europe, and even the United States. This preoccupation is natural. International terrorism literally hit home on September 11, 2001, and, for understandable reasons, an outraged American public wants those responsible brought to justice. The American people also want to understand why the attacks happened -- and demand a foreign policy that makes sure such events will never happen again. 
It is also natural that the war on terrorism has become the United States' number one foreign policy priority. It will remain so for as long as necessary, because terrorism -- potentially linked to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) -- now represents the greatest threat to American lives. Defeating terrorism is a priority that drives not only military action to subdue individual terrorists and deter their state supporters but also multilateral cooperation in law enforcement and intelligence sharing. It encompasses efforts both to stigmatize terrorism as a political instrument and to reduce the underlying sources of terrorist motivation and recruitment. 
But the breadth of U.S. strategy transcends the war on terrorism. Indeed, a strategy limited to dealing with immediate threats would in the end fail to defeat them -- just as bailing water out of a boat would not fix a leak. The sharp focus on the front lines of the war against terrorism, however, has made it harder than usual for people to grasp what American strategy is really all about. We all know the old aphorism that you can lead a horse to water but you can't make it drink. These days, it seems that an administration can develop a sound foreign policy strategy, but it can't get some people to acknowledge or understand it. 
President Bush's Vision 
It is an unfailingly effective applause line for critics of any U.S. administration to charge that the president has no vision for the world, that he has no strategy. Every trouble is attributed to this failing, as though the world would otherwise be perfectly accommodating to U.S. purposes. Unfortunately, this criticism has come close to being true in some administrations. But it is not true in the present one. President George W. Bush does have a vision of a better world. And he also has a strategy for translating that vision into reality. I know -- I was present at its creation. 
The president's strategy was first laid out publicly in September 2002, in the National Security Strategy of the United States (NSS). A succinct document of fewer than 40 pages, the NSS defines U.S. policy priorities in eight substantive sections. Together, these parts add up to an integrated strategy that is broad and deep, far ranging and forward looking, attuned as much to opportunities for the United States as to the dangers it faces. 
Of course, a public strategy document cannot be entirely frank about all the choices that U.S. leaders make; we do ourselves and our allies no favors by telling our adversaries everything that we think and plan. Nonetheless, this administration's public pronouncements have been remarkably candid. They reflect the personality of the president himself, a man who, with great consistency, says what he means and means what he says. 
It is somewhat odd, therefore, to discover that our foreign policy strategy is so often misunderstood by both domestic and foreign observers. U.S. strategy is widely accused of being unilateralist by design. It isn't. It is often accused of being imbalanced in favor of military methods. It isn't. It is frequently described as being obsessed with terrorism and hence biased toward preemptive war on a global scale. It most certainly is not. 
These distortions are partly explained by context. The NSS made the concept of preemption explicit in the heady aftermath of September 11, and it did so for obvious reasons. One reason was to reassure the American people that the government possessed common sense. As President Bush has said -- and as any sensible person understands -- if you recognize a clear and present threat that is undeterrable by the means you have at hand, then you must deal with it. You do not wait for it to strike; you do not allow future attacks to happen before you take action. 
A second reason for including the notion of preemption in the NSS was to convey to our adversaries that they were in big trouble. Instilling a certain amount of anxiety in terrorist groups increases the likelihood they will cease activity or make mistakes and be caught. Moreover, some states have been complicit in terrorism not for ideological reasons but for opportunistic ones. It was worth putting the leaders of such countries on notice that the potential costs of their opportunism had just gone way up. 
Sensible as these reasons are, some observers have exaggerated both the scope of preemption in foreign policy and the centrality of preemption in U.S. strategy as a whole. As to preemption's scope, it applies only to undeterrable threats such as those that come from nonstate actors like terrorist groups. It was never meant to displace deterrence, only to supplement it. As to its being central, it isn't. The discussion of preemption in the NSS takes up just two sentences in one of the document's eight sections. 
Some at home have distorted the NSS for partisan reasons, attempting to make the Bush administration look bad by turning fear of preemption into an early twenty-first-century equivalent of the Cold War era's ""rocket rattle."" Some abroad, meanwhile, have distorted U.S. intentions through an apparent exercise in mirror imaging. Using their own mottled political histories as a reference point, they have asked what they would do with the power that the United States possesses and have mistakenly projected their own Hobbesian intentions onto our rather more Lockean sensibilities. 
But however it has happened, the distortion of U.S. foreign policy strategy requires repair. This distortion does a disservice to honest observers trying to understand U.S. policy, and it contributes to irrational partisanship. 
The Primacy of Partnerships 
The United States' National Security Strategy does commit us to preemption under certain limited circumstances. We stand by that judgment, the novelty of which lies less in its substance than in its explicitness. But our strategy is not defined by preemption. Above all, the president's strategy is one of partnerships that strongly affirms the vital role of NATO and other U.S. alliances -- including the un. 
Don't believe it? Perhaps this is because the commentariat widely claimed that the president's recent decision to seek a new UN Security Council resolution on the postwar reconstruction of Iraq was a sharp break with policy. To think this, one would have to ignore the fact that President Bush went before the UN September 12, 2002, to make his case for the un's enforcing its own resolutions (16 of them in total); that Security Council Resolution 1441 -- which warned the Iraqi regime to comply with its own obligations under previous UN resolutions -- passed unanimously in November 2002; that we tried for a further resolution to unite the international community in the months before Operation Iraqi Freedom began; that we went to the UN in May 2003 after Operation Iraqi Freedom to secure Resolution 1483, lifting sanctions against Iraq that had become obsolete; and that we sought and secured Resolution 1500 in August, recognizing the Iraqi Governing Council. 
Had we not done all of these things, month after month, the president's decision to go to the UN Security Council in September 2003 -- and to persevere in his efforts until Resolution 1511 was approved by a 15-0 vote on October 16 -- would have been a significant departure from policy. But the administration did do all of these things. Indeed, it would have been a departure from policy not to go to the UN when, in our judgment, the next phase of Iraqi reconstruction was at hand. If there has been any departure here, it is the commentariat's departure from the basic rules of logic. 
Partnership is the watchword of U.S. strategy in this administration. Partnership is not about deferring to others; it is about working with them. Beyond upholding the partnerships we have inherited, the president seeks new ones to deal with new challenges. Some are global in scope, such as the Global Fund for HIV/AIDS. Others are regional, such as the Middle East Partnership Initiative, which provides assistance for educational, economic, and political reform throughout the Arab world. 
Beyond partnership comes principle. The president's strategy is rooted, above all, in the promotion of freedom and dignity worldwide. ""America must stand firmly,"" the president wrote, ""for the non-negotiable demands of human dignity: the rule of law; limits on the absolute power of the state; free speech; freedom of worship; equal justice; respect for women; religious and ethnic tolerance; and respect for private property."" We stand by these values now and always. They are the values served by the partnerships that we build and nurture. 
Free trade and new American initiatives for economic development also figure prominently in the president's strategy. The Free Trade Area of the Americas, the expanded Africa Growth and Opportunity Act, and especially the Millennium Challenge Account are our policy vanguards in this area. Our efforts to control the proliferation of wmd also form part of the president's strategy. These efforts led to the Proliferation Security Initiative in May 2003, an 11-nation effort to seize materials related to wmd in transit to countries of concern. In September 2003, signatories were able to agree on basic implementation guidelines, and in the president's address to the UN General Assembly on September 24, he called other nations to join. I hope they will heed his invitation. 

President Bush's strategy also demands that we play a role in helping to solve regional conflicts. Not only do such conflicts cause much suffering, but they can also spread to envelop societies now at peace and can stoke the fires of terrorism. Nowhere is the U.S. role in helping to resolve regional conflicts more important than in bringing Israelis and Palestinians to a stable peace settlement. We are obviously not there yet, but this administration's policies have brought peace closer. 
The Bush administration was widely criticized during its first two years in office for not being more active in solving the Arab-Israeli conflict. To many, ""more active"" meant spending presidential and secretarial capital on state visits and photo opportunities, as if nearly a decade of such activity had not already been tried without managing to resolve the conflict. But diplomacy can take other, more appropriate forms. In reality, we have worked hard on advancing peace, if often quietly, making the proper analysis of the situation and determining our tactics accordingly. 
As a result, we created the Quartet -- another partnership -- made up of the United States, the European Union, Russia, and the un. We developed the ""road map"" out of this partnership, and the president went to Aqaba, Jordan, in June 2003 to commit the parties to it. 
Most important, we recognized that there needed to be fundamental reform inside the Palestinian Authority if the forces for peace among Palestinians were to prevail. After it became clear that the United States would not obstruct Israel's efforts to defend itself from Palestinian terrorism, pressures for genuine reform grew within the Palestinian community. This convergence produced the hopeful premiership of Mahmoud Abbas. 
Unfortunately, Abbas' efforts were aborted by Chairman Yasir Arafat, and Abbas' successor, Ahmed Qurei, has been obstructed as well. Chairman Arafat has not been a genuine interlocutor for peace, but he has been an obstacle to it. Although our hopes for progress have been temporarily disappointed, it is now clear to all where the real problem lies. One way or another, we are bound eventually to get past this problem. Moreover, there is now a solid and growing constituency in Israel that supports prominent Palestinian leaders who genuinely seek an honorable and stable peace. Bleak as things often seem in this conflict, this does represent progress. 
Conflicts in other regions have also demanded our attention -- and our compassion. The United States has not turned away from the suffering of the Liberian people, and we have been actively trying to end strife in Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Nor have we forgotten the need for continued progress in the Balkans, in Northern Ireland, and in East Timor. We are making progress in most if not all of these areas, and we are often doing so by supporting other governments that are taking the lead. In other words, we are working as a partner. 
An Age of Cooperation 
Not least among the policy priorities laid out in the NSS is our determination to develop cooperative relations among the world's major powers. It is here, above all, that the key to a successful conclusion to the war against terrorism lies. 
To say that the world has changed is a truism: the world, after all, is always changing. It is not so trivial, however, to specify just how it has changed. As I see it, the critical tipping point of recent years was the evening of November 9, 1989. That date is when the Berlin Wall was first breached, never to be repaired, marking the end of the Cold War and, before long, of the Soviet Union itself. These events, in turn, ended the epoch of intense struggle between liberty and totalitarianism that had shaped most of the twentieth century. 
The president grasps the importance of these momentous events. As he wrote in the NSS, ""today, the international community has the best chance since the rise of the nation-state in the seventeenth century to build a world where great powers compete in peace instead of continually prepare for war. Today, the world's great powers find ourselves on the same side."" 
This development is not just good news; it is revolutionary news. For too many years -- too many centuries -- the imperial habits of great powers squandered untold resources and talent by jousting for land, glory, and gold. The futility of such habits has become evident in the twenty-first century. The possession of vast territory, raw physical resources, and brute power guarantees neither prosperity nor peace. Investment in human capital, social trust, trade, and cooperation within and among nations does. 
The sources of national strength and security for one nation thus need no longer threaten the security of others. An insight of the Enlightenment and a deep belief of the American founders -- that politics need not always be a zero-sum competition -- has at last been adopted by enough people worldwide to promise a qualitative difference in the character of international relations. If, instead of wasting lives and treasure by opposing each other as in the past, today's powers can pull in the same direction to solve problems common to all, we will begin to redeem history from much human folly. 
One of these common problems is, of course, terrorism, and American strategy endeavors to solve it by integrating it into the management of our key international relationships. We do not see the war against terrorism and the nurturing of constructive relationships among the major powers as mutually exclusive tasks. We conduct the war on terrorism with an eye toward great-power cooperation, and we seek enhanced great-power cooperation with an eye toward success in the war on terrorism. 
The logic of this dual approach rests on the fact that terrorism threatens the world order itself -- and thus creates a common interest among all powers that value peace, prosperity, and the rule of law. The civilized world has spent more than a thousand years trying to limit the destructiveness of war. Drawing a distinction between civilians and combatants has been an essential part of this process. But terrorism aims to erase that distinction. We cannot allow this to happen, not because we want to ""make the world safe"" again for major conventional war, but because we must reassure people everywhere that the world has not just traded one kind of danger for another with the end of the Cold War. The victory of freedom will turn hollow if new fears replace old ones. 
The common interest of all major powers in defeating terrorism is one source of a rare and remarkable opportunity: the United States' chance to enjoy excellent relations with all the world's major powers simultaneously. Of course, we have a head start in this, because we are blessed with many enduring friendships. None is more important than those enshrined in NATO. 
Some observers predicted that NATO would wither away after the Cold War, others that the United States and the European Union would even end up on a collision course. Neither prediction has, or will, come true. Not only has NATO survived, but both its membership and its mission have expanded. As for our relations with the EU, never has our common agenda been so large and mutually significant -- from advancing free trade to joint efforts in counterproliferation. 
It is true that we have had differences with some of our oldest and most valued NATO allies. But these are differences among friends. The transatlantic partnership is based so firmly on common interests and values that neither feuding personalities nor occasional divergent perceptions can derail it. We have new friends and old friends alike in Europe. They are all, in the end, best friends, which is why the president continues to talk about partnerships, not polarities, when he speaks about Europe. Some authorities say that we must move to a multipolar world. We do not agree -- not because we do not value competition and diversity, but because there need be no poles among a family of nations that shares basic values. We believe that it is wiser to work at overcoming differences than to polarize them further. 
Embracing Major Powers 
We work hard to have the best relations we can with nations large and small, old and new. But for practical purposes we concentrate on relations with major powers, especially those with whom we have had difficult relationships in the past, notably Russia, India, and China. 
Our relationship with Russia has been dramatically transformed since that November evening in 1989. Americans and Russians no longer point growing arsenals of missiles at each other. Thanks to the leadership of President Bush and President Vladimir Putin, we are now radically reducing our strategic weapons arsenals. Moscow is also a committed partner in fighting terrorism and in combating the global spread of wmd. 
U.S.-Russia commercial relations have also expanded and will expand further to mutual benefit -- not least, we trust, in the energy sector. The new relationship that is developing between Russia and NATO has real substance as well. From sharing intelligence on terrorism to working together to deal with humanitarian crises and peacekeeping, the NATO-Russia Council is operational. That relationship can expand as far as our creativity and mutual effort will let it. We are closer than ever to a Europe whole, free, and at peace. Such a Europe definitely includes Russia, as well as the other new and reborn republics that emerged from the Soviet Union. 
Perhaps most important, U.S. and Russian political and economic philosophies are converging. Today, Russia is more democratic than not. It is also more of a market economy than not. We should be patient as Russia develops its democratic institutions and as the remnants of Soviet-era corruption is rooted out and the rule of law firmly established. 
We do not agree on everything, of course. We had hoped for more Russian support for our Iraq policy, and we still hope Russia will change its attitude toward the Iranian nuclear program. We also differ over aspects of Russian policy in Chechnya. But the relationship as a whole is no longer locked in knee-jerk antagonism. We now have the necessary level of trust to resolve even the most difficult issues between us. 
Whereas Russia is still developing its democracy, India's democracy dates from its independence in 1947. With recent economic reforms setting institutional roots, India is developing into a mature market economy. As Indians themselves are the first to admit, however, their country still faces many challenges. Illiteracy, poverty, environmental degradation, and inadequate infrastructure all hamper progress. We want to help India overcome these challenges, and we want to help ourselves through a closer association with one of the world's venerable cultures. We have therefore worked to deepen our relationship with India. The two largest democracies on earth are no longer estranged. At the same time, we have also been able to advance our relations with Pakistan -- a country with domestic challenges of its own. 
India and Pakistan still dispute who should control Kashmir. During 2002, a major war between them -- perhaps involving nuclear weapons -- seemed distinctly possible. So, working with partners in Europe and Asia, we mobilized to help end the crisis. We have since been trying to turn our parallel improvement of relations with India and Pakistan into a triangle of conflict resolution. We do not impose ourselves as a mediator. But we do try to use the trust we have established with both sides to urge them toward conciliation by peaceful means. 
What the United States has done in South Asia is an example of ""turning adversity into opportunity,"" to quote President Bush. In a different way, we have done the same with China. 
Sino-American relations got off to a bad start in this administration when a certain American airplane made an unscheduled visit to Hainan Island in April 2001. Today, however, U.S. relations with China are the best they have been since President Richard Nixon first visited Beijing more than 30 years ago. This is not just because the September 11 attacks led us to shuffle priorities, nor only because we championed Chinese accession to the World Trade Organization; nor is it the result of the accession of a new generation of Chinese leaders. It is certainly not because we have ignored Chinese human rights abuses, China's still unacceptable weapons proliferation activities, or the reluctance of China's leadership to match political to economic reform. We have never downplayed these difficulties. 
The Sino-American relationship has nonetheless improved for a reason that transcends all these particulars: neither we nor the Chinese believe that there is anything inevitable about our relationship any longer -- either inevitably bad or inevitably good. Instead, we now believe that it is up to us, together, to take responsibility for our common future. The NSS put it directly: ""We welcome the emergence of a strong, peaceful, and prosperous China."" We also seek a constructive relationship. Indeed, we welcome a global role for China, so long as China assumes responsibilities commensurate with that role. China's leaders know all this. Neither false fear about the future nor the overhang of Cold War enmity prevents us from cooperating where our interests coincide. 
A case in point is North Korea. American and Chinese interests on the Korean Peninsula may not overlap completely, but they do so considerably. Neither side wishes to see nuclear weapons developed and deployed there. Neither side enjoys the spectacle of the dilapidated North Korean economy. Neither side wants the refugee crisis on China's border to worsen nor relishes a North Korean regime that smuggles drugs and weapons, counterfeits currencies, and engages in the periodic extortion of its neighbors through brinkmanship. And neither side, to be sure, has any interest in another Korean war. 
Thus we have worked to transform our common interests with China into solid and productive cooperation over the challenges posed by Pyongyang. We are also cooperating with Japan, Russia, and South Korea on the issue. Our agenda is ambitious, but it is succeeding, as attested to by the six-party framework for talks over North Korea's nuclear program. We employed this framework in September 2003, and we will do so again soon. Beijing, as well as Washington, deserves credit for this achievement. 
We still have a long way to go in dealing with North Korea's dangerous nuclear weapons program. As we have told the North Koreans, we have no intention of invading or attacking North Korea. During his trip to Asia in October 2003, President Bush suggested that he was even open to putting this intention in writing. We have stated our policy openly and honestly: we want peace, not war, and we want security, not fear, to envelop the Korean Peninsula and its neighbors. But we will not yield to threats and blackmail; if we did, we would only guarantee more threats and more attempts at blackmail. Nor will we take any options off the table. 
It is now well past time for North Korea to alter its behavior, cease its threats, and end its nuclear weapons program in a verifiable manner. That is what all of North Korea's neighbors desire, which is why, in the end, a diplomatic solution to the problem can be achieved. When this happens, we will have demonstrated that American diplomacy is designed to satisfy not only our own national interests, but also those of international security as a whole. We will show that the equities of other powers can be best advanced along with American ones, not in opposition to them. 
Interests and Responsibilities 
We must not take the present peace among the world's nations for granted. Today's peace will not just take care of itself. We have to work at it with patience, mindful that major war has broken out in the past despite a widespread conviction that it simply could not happen again. 
Of course, we want to promote human dignity and democracy in the world, to help people raise themselves from poverty, and to transform the inadequate system of global public health. We are pursuing these goals right now. But only if the deep peace of our era can be ""preserved, defended, and expanded"" -- to use the president's words -- can we pursue these goals for as long as it will take to achieve them. 
And make no mistake, these are the central goals of American policy in the twenty-first century. We fight terrorism because we must, but we seek a better world because we can -- because it is our desire, and our destiny, to do so. This is why we commit ourselves to democracy, development, global public health, and human rights, as well as to the prerequisite of a solid structure for global peace. These are not high-sounding decorations for our interests. They are our interests, the purposes our power serves. 
Because this is so, the United States' reputation for honesty and compassion will endure. Today, U.S. motives are impugned in some lands. But as we preserve, defend, and expand the peace that free peoples won in the twentieth century, we will see the United States vindicated in the eyes of the world in the twenty-first. 
It would be churlish to claim that the Bush administration's foreign policy has been error-free from the start. We are human beings; we all make mistakes. But we have always pursued the enlightened self-interest of the American people, and in our purposes and our principles there are no mistakes. 
Our enlightened self-interest puts us at odds with terrorists, tyrants, and others who wish us ill. From them we seek no advice or comity, and to them we will give no quarter. But our enlightened self-interest makes us partners with all those who cherish freedom, human dignity, and peace. We know the side on which the human spirit truly abides, and we take encouragement from this as our strategy unfolds. In the end, it is the only encouragement we really need.

It is also natural that the war on terrorism has become the United States' number one foreign policy priority. It will remain so for as long as necessary, because terrorism -- potentially linked to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) -- now represents the greatest threat to American lives. Defeating terrorism is a priority that drives not only military action to subdue individual terrorists and deter their state supporters but also multilateral cooperation in law enforcement and intelligence sharing. It encompasses efforts both to stigmatize terrorism as a political instrument and to reduce the underlying sources of terrorist motivation and recruitment.

But the breadth of U.S. strategy transcends the war on terrorism. Indeed, a strategy limited to dealing with immediate threats would in the end fail to defeat them -- just as bailing water out of a boat would not fix a leak. The sharp focus on the front lines of the war against terrorism, however, has made it harder than usual for people to grasp what American strategy is really all about. We all know the old aphorism that you can lead a horse to water but you can't make it drink. These days, it seems that an administration can develop a sound foreign policy strategy, but it can't get some people to acknowledge or understand it.



The president's strategy was first laid out publicly in September 2002, in the National Security Strategy of the United States (NSS). A succinct document of fewer than 40 pages, the NSS defines U.S. policy priorities in eight substantive sections. Together, these parts add up to an integrated strategy that is broad and deep, far ranging and forward looking, attuned as much to opportunities for the United States as to the dangers it faces.

The futility of such habits has become evident in the twenty-first century. The possession of vast territory, raw physical resources, and brute power guarantees neither prosperity nor peace. Investment in human capital, social trust, trade, and cooperation within and among nations does.

The sources of national strength and security for one nation thus need no longer threaten the security of others. An insight of the Enlightenment and a deep belief of the American founders -- that politics need not always be a zero-sum competition -- has at last been adopted by enough people worldwide to promise a qualitative difference in the character of international relations. If, instead of wasting lives and treasure by opposing each other as in the past, today's powers can pull in the same direction to solve problems common to all, we will begin to redeem history from much human folly.

One of these common problems is, of course, terrorism, and American strategy endeavors to solve it by integrating it into the management of our key international relationships. We do not see the war against terrorism and the nurturing of constructive relationships among the major powers as mutually exclusive tasks. We conduct the war on terrorism with an eye toward great-power cooperation, and we seek enhanced great-power cooperation with an eye toward success in the war on terrorism.

The logic of this dual approach rests on the fact that terrorism threatens the world order itself -- and thus creates a common interest among all powers that value peace, prosperity, and the rule of law. The civilized world has spent more than a thousand years trying to limit the destructiveness of war. Drawing a distinction between civilians and combatants has been an essential part of this process. But terrorism aims to erase that distinction. We cannot allow this to happen, not because we want to ""make the world safe"" again for major conventional war, but because we must reassure people everywhere that the world has not just traded one kind of danger for another with the end of the Cold War. The victory of freedom will turn hollow if new fears replace old ones.

The common interest of all major powers in defeating terrorism is one source of a rare and remarkable opportunity: the United States' chance to enjoy excellent relations with all the world's major powers simultaneously. Of course, we have a head start in this, because we are blessed with many enduring friendships. None is more important than those enshrined in NATO.

Some observers predicted that NATO would wither away after the Cold War, others that the United States and the European Union would even end up on a collision course. Neither prediction has, or will, come true. Not only has NATO survived, but both its membership and its mission have expanded. As for our relations with the EU, never has our common agenda been so large and mutually significant -- from advancing free trade to joint efforts in counterproliferation.

It is true that we have had differences with some of our oldest and most valued NATO allies. But these are differences among friends. The transatlantic partnership is based so firmly on common interests and values that neither feuding personalities nor occasional divergent perceptions can derail it. We have new friends and old friends alike in Europe. They are all, in the end, best friends, which is why the president continues to talk about partnerships, not polarities, when he speaks about Europe. Some authorities say that we must move to a multipolar world. We do not agree -- not because we do not value competition and diversity, but because there need be no poles among a family of nations that shares basic values. We believe that it is wiser to work at overcoming differences than to polarize them further.



Our relationship with Russia has been dramatically transformed since that November evening in 1989. Americans and Russians no longer point growing arsenals of missiles at each other. Thanks to the leadership of President Bush and President Vladimir Putin, we are now radically reducing our strategic weapons arsenals. Moscow is also a committed partner in fighting terrorism and in combating the global spread of wmd.

U.S.-Russia commercial relations have also expanded and will expand further to mutual benefit -- not least, we trust, in the energy sector. The new relationship that is developing between Russia and NATO has real substance as well. From sharing intelligence on terrorism to working together to deal with humanitarian crises and peacekeeping, the NATO-Russia Council is operational. That relationship can expand as far as our creativity and mutual effort will let it. We are closer than ever to a Europe whole, free, and at peace. Such a Europe definitely includes Russia, as well as the other new and reborn republics that emerged from the Soviet Union.

Perhaps most important, U.S. and Russian political and economic philosophies are converging. Today, Russia is more democratic than not. It is also more of a market economy than not. We should be patient as Russia develops its democratic institutions and as the remnants of Soviet-era corruption is rooted out and the rule of law firmly established.

We do not agree on everything, of course. We had hoped for more Russian support for our Iraq policy, and we still hope Russia will change its attitude toward the Iranian nuclear program. We also differ over aspects of Russian policy in Chechnya. But the relationship as a whole is no longer locked in knee-jerk antagonism. We now have the necessary level of trust to resolve even the most difficult issues between us.

Whereas Russia is still developing its democracy, India's democracy dates from its independence in 1947. With recent economic reforms setting institutional roots, India is developing into a mature market economy. As Indians themselves are the first to admit, however, their country still faces many challenges. Illiteracy, poverty, environmental degradation, and inadequate infrastructure all hamper progress. We want to help India overcome these challenges, and we want to help ourselves through a closer association with one of the world's venerable cultures. We have therefore worked to deepen our relationship with India. The two largest democracies on earth are no longer estranged. At the same time, we have also been able to advance our relations with Pakistan -- a country with domestic challenges of its own.

India and Pakistan still dispute who should control Kashmir. During 2002, a major war between them -- perhaps involving nuclear weapons -- seemed distinctly possible. So, working with partners in Europe and Asia, we mobilized to help end the crisis. We have since been trying to turn our parallel improvement of relations with India and Pakistan into a triangle of conflict resolution. We do not impose ourselves as a mediator. But we do try to use the trust we have established with both sides to urge them toward conciliation by peaceful means.

What the United States has done in South Asia is an example of ""turning adversity into opportunity,"" to quote President Bush. In a different way, we have done the same with China.

Sino-American relations got off to a bad start in this administration when a certain American airplane made an unscheduled visit to Hainan Island in April 2001. Today, however, U.S. relations with China are the best they have been since President Richard Nixon first visited Beijing more than 30 years ago. This is not just because the September 11 attacks led us to shuffle priorities, nor only because we championed Chinese accession to the World Trade Organization; nor is it the result of the accession of a new generation of Chinese leaders. It is certainly not because we have ignored Chinese human rights abuses, China's still unacceptable weapons proliferation activities, or the reluctance of China's leadership to match political to economic reform. We have never downplayed these difficulties.

The Sino-American relationship has nonetheless improved for a reason that transcends all these particulars: neither we nor the Chinese believe that there is anything inevitable about our relationship any longer -- either inevitably bad or inevitably good. Instead, we now believe that it is up to us, together, to take responsibility for our common future. The NSS put it directly: ""We welcome the emergence of a strong, peaceful, and prosperous China."" We also seek a constructive relationship. Indeed, we welcome a global role for China, so long as China assumes responsibilities commensurate with that role. China's leaders know all this. Neither false fear about the future nor the overhang of Cold War enmity prevents us from cooperating where our interests coincide.

A case in point is North Korea. American and Chinese interests on the Korean Peninsula may not overlap completely, but they do so considerably. Neither side wishes to see nuclear weapons developed and deployed there. Neither side enjoys the spectacle of the dilapidated North Korean economy. Neither side wants the refugee crisis on China's border to worsen nor relishes a North Korean regime that smuggles drugs and weapons, counterfeits currencies, and engages in the periodic extortion of its neighbors through brinkmanship. And neither side, to be sure, has any interest in another Korean war.

Thus we have worked to transform our common interests with China into solid and productive cooperation over the challenges posed by Pyongyang. We are also cooperating with Japan, Russia, and South Korea on the issue. Our agenda is ambitious, but it is succeeding, as attested to by the six-party framework for talks over North Korea's nuclear program. We employed this framework in September 2003, and we will do so again soon. Beijing, as well as Washington, deserves credit for this achievement.

We still have a long way to go in dealing with North Korea's dangerous nuclear weapons program. As we have told the North Koreans, we have no intention of invading or attacking North Korea. During his trip to Asia in October 2003, President Bush suggested that he was even open to putting this intention in writing. We have stated our policy openly and honestly: we want peace, not war, and we want security, not fear, to envelop the Korean Peninsula and its neighbors. But we will not yield to threats and blackmail; if we did, we would only guarantee more threats and more attempts at blackmail. Nor will we take any options off the table.

It is now well past time for North Korea to alter its behavior, cease its threats, and end its nuclear weapons program in a verifiable manner. That is what all of North Korea's neighbors desire, which is why, in the end, a diplomatic solution to the problem can be achieved. When this happens, we will have demonstrated that American diplomacy is designed to satisfy not only our own national interests, but also those of international security as a whole. We will show that the equities of other powers can be best advanced along with American ones, not in opposition to them.



Of course, we want to promote human dignity and democracy in the world, to help people raise themselves from poverty, and to transform the inadequate system of global public health. We are pursuing these goals right now. But only if the deep peace of our era can be ""preserved, defended, and expanded"" -- to use the president's words -- can we pursue these goals for as long as it will take to achieve them.

And make no mistake, these are the central goals of American policy in the twenty-first century. We fight terrorism because we must, but we seek a better world because we can -- because it is our desire, and our destiny, to do so. This is why we commit ourselves to democracy, development, global public health, and human rights, as well as to the prerequisite of a solid structure for global peace. These are not high-sounding decorations for our interests. They are our interests, the purposes our power serves.

Because this is so, the United States' reputation for honesty and compassion will endure. Today, U.S. motives are impugned in some lands. But as we preserve, defend, and expand the peace that free peoples won in the twentieth century, we will see the United States vindicated in the eyes of the world in the twenty-first.

It would be churlish to claim that the Bush administration's foreign policy has been error-free from the start. We are human beings; we all make mistakes. But we have always pursued the enlightened self-interest of the American people, and in our purposes and our principles there are no mistakes.

Our enlightened self-interest puts us at odds with terrorists, tyrants, and others who wish us ill. From them we seek no advice or comity, and to them we will give no quarter. But our enlightened self-interest makes us partners with all those who cherish freedom, human dignity, and peace. We know the side on which the human spirit truly abides, and we take encouragement from this as our strategy unfolds. In the end, it is the only encouragement we really need.

Colin Powell,20031203,Terrorist Designation Under Executive Order 13224,"Secretary of State Colin L. Powell on February 14 designated three Chechen organizations -- the Islamic International Brigade, the Special Purpose Islamic Regiment, and the Riyadus-Salikhin Reconnaissance and Sabotage Battalion of Chechen Martyrs -- as terrorist groups under the Executive Order on terrorist financing. 
The Islamic International Brigade, the Special Purpose Islamic Regiment, and the Riyadus-Salikhin Battalion are violent groups responsible for committing numerous acts of terrorism in Russia, including hostage-taking and assassination, that have threatened the safety of U.S. citizens and U.S. national security or foreign policy interests. All three groups were directly involved in the seizure of over 800 hostages at Moscow's Dubrovka Theater last October, an incident that resulted in the deaths of 129 hostages, including one U.S. citizen.
In making this designation, the United States calls on all Chechen leaders to renounce terrorist acts and cut any ties they may have to these terrorist groups and all who are affiliated with them. And we recognize that there are terrorist elements among those fighting Russian forces in Chechnya. At the same time, we do not consider all Chechen fighters to be terrorists. 
It remains our position that the broader conflict in Chechnya cannot be resolved militarily and requires a political solution. We have made this point repeatedly to the Russians. We urge Russia to pursue a political settlement and to establish meaningful accountability for human rights violations by its armed forces in Chechnya. We also condemn acts of terrorism and other abuses committed by armed Chechen groups.
The United States also underscores its strong support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia, a partner in the war on terrorism. We urge Russia to respect Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity while continuing to cooperate with Georgia and the United States on the issue of Chechen fighters and international terrorists in the Pankisi Gorge.
Executive Order 13224 blocks assets of these groups that are in the United States or held by U.S. persons, wherever located. Among other things, it further has the effect of prohibiting any U.S. persons from making or receiving any contribution of funds, goods, or services for the benefit of these groups. The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) today added the names of these three groups to its website as Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGTs). Section 1(b) of the Order, as amended, authorizes the Secretary of State to designate foreign entities and individuals that he determines -- in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of Homeland Security -- to have committed, or to pose a significant risk of committing, acts of terrorism that threaten the security of U.S. nationals or the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States.
Because these three groups are linked to Al-Qaida, the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom, China and Spain have requested today that the United Nations 1267 Sanctions Committee include the groups on its consolidated list pursuant to UN Security Council Resolutions 1267, 1390 and 1455. France has also indicated it will join the designation. This would be the first time that all five permanent members of the Security Council have joined in submitting names to the 1267 Committee. All UN Member States are obligated to impose arms and travel sanctions on, and to freeze without delay assets of, any individual or entity on the consolidated list, and to prohibit their nationals or persons in their territories from making available any funds or other resources to such entities.

Colin Powell,20030709,"Partnership, Under Construction","What a difference thirty years can make. It was in the winter of 1973 that I first visited the USSR. I entered the country at Khabarovsk, rode the Trans-Siberian railroad to Irkutsk, then flew to Moscow. I stood in Red Square, toured the GUM department store, and took in all I could about the country that I, as a member of the U.S. military establishment, had learned to both respect and fear. 
From that first trip I gathered three strong impressions of Russia. One was of its immensity and beauty. A second was of the common humanity between the Russian and American people that, I believed, would one day triumph over our political differences. My third impression was of the terrifying capacity of the Soviet ruling apparatus to intimidate its own people, to crush the human spirit.
Today, as I return again to Russia, I see that the country is still immense, and still very beautiful. I see that the common humanity of the Russian and the American people has triumphed over old differences. Most important, I see that Soviet terror is gone, enabling both sides to cut away at the thick crust of suspicion that characterized our Cold War relationship. 
Thirty years ago, Russian and American leaders sat in separate rooms, looked at maps, and saw target sets. Today, Russians and Americans often sit in the same room, look together at maps, and see targets of opportunity for cooperation on common problems. 
We do this in our joint efforts to fight terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and as we together fight HIV/AIDS and drug-resistant tuberculosis. We do this in Korea, where our cooperation includes that of China, Japan and South Korea. And we do this in the Russia-NATO Council, where the objects of our cooperation range from the Balkans and Afghanistan to anti-missile defense. 
The United States and Russia cooperate to mutual benefit, in part, because our interests coincide. We both recognize, for example, that terrorism threatens the essential moral order of international life as well as innocent human beings. We can cooperate on developing further Russias energy resources, matching products to markets and diversifying global energy resources, because both sides will prosper from it. 
But our ability to cooperate rests, too, on trust, which President Bush and President Putin have labored tirelessly to build. The knee-jerk antagonism of the past is behind us. We can now deal effectively with even the most difficult issues between us. We are friends now, and we can speak frankly to each other as only true friends can.It is natural that there will be occasions for such frank speaking. Although we share much in common, our histories, cultures, and geographies are different. So we do not agree on all policy questions; but then, no two major nations do.
We must acknowledge the sources of our differences if we are to deal wisely with one another. Beyond interests and trust among leaders, the capacity of any two nations to cooperate rests on a convergence of basic principles shared broadly in society. Here, too, thirty years has proved a long time. Our basic political and economic philosophies are closer today than ever. 
But as democracy is a work in progress even where it is most mature, so it is a work in progress in Russia. We know that the civic institutions of a democratic society take time to develop, that a nation cannot leap all at once out of its history anymore than a person can leap out of his skin. We know that the path to a democratic future is not a straight or an easy one. 
There can be no doubt, however, that Russias future greatness lies in its achieving stable democratic institutions. Political, economic and intellectual freedom form the gateway to prosperity, strength and social development in the 21st century. We welcome such a future for Russia. We do so as an expression of our common humanity, for the whole world will benefit from the flowering of Russias economy, sciences and arts. And we do so because we know that without basic principles shared in common, our relationship will not achieve its potential. This is why certain developments in Russian politics and foreign policy in recent months have given us pause. 
Russias democratic system seems not yet to have found the essential balance among the executive, legislative and judicial branches of government. Political power is not yet fully tethered to law. Key aspects of civil society  free media and political party development, for example  have not yet sustained an independent presence. Certain aspects of internal Russian policy in Chechnya, and toward neighbors that emerged from the former Soviet Union, have concerned us, too. We recognize Russias territorial integrity and its natural interest in lands that abut it. But we recognize no less the sovereign integrity of Russias neighbors and their rights to peaceful and respectful relations across their borders, as well.
Russia has too much to offer the world for us allow the promise of our partnership to go unfulfilled. As we joined thirty years ago to develop the Apollo-Soyuz mission, thirty years from now we can be surveying together the outer reaches of the solar system. Here on earth, our countries scientists can work together with the governments of Central Asia to restore the natural environment there, for example. We can work together to improve the global public health system to meet the challenges of our time. Our leaders can work together for peace, prosperity and freedom worldwide. 
Americas friendship with Russia, and with the Russian people, will not abate. Since our partnership ultimately does not depend on personalities, but on mutual interests and shared values, our hand will be outstretched, our hearts will remain open. As Russia constructs a new democratic political life, so we together will construct a greater U.S.-Russian partnership. 
We hope that Russias path to mature democracy and prosperity is cleared soon of all obstacles. We both have a large stake in that journey, and we trust in its eventual completion. It will take time. But after all, we know what a difference thirty years can make.

Colin Powell,20030709,"Secretary of State Colin L. Powell And The Honorable Alphonso Jackson, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and Head of U.S. Delegation to OSCE Conference on Racism, Xenophobia and Discrimination After Their Meeting","(1:50 p.m. EDT) 
SECRETARY POWELL: Well, good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. As President Bush has said, the United States of America stands for the non-negotiable demands of human dignity. That is why we place such a high importance on the conference and the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe, a conference that will be held on tolerance and the fight against racism, xenophobia and discrimination which the Belgian Government will graciously host in Brussels on September 13th and 14th. You may recall that we also sent a strong delegation to last year's conference under the leadership of former Congressman J.C. Watts. 
We do this because we applaud the OSCE's pioneering work in fighting intolerance, reflected earlier this year in the Berlin Conference on Anti-Semitism which I had the privilege to attend and represent the United States at. 
The upcoming conference in Brussels is an important opportunity to further raise public awareness of the rise in hate crimes and other acts of intolerance that have occurred in Europe and North America this year. The United States is honored that my friend and cabinet colleague, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Alphonso Jackson, will lead a distinguished delegation to the conference. Secretary Jackson has a long history of activism in key areas of civil rights, education and community development. 
Secretary Jackson will be joined by Mr. Robert Woodson, Sr., who is also present with us today, of the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, and Ms. Tamar Jacoby of The Manhattan Institute, who is also with us today, who has championed the plight of migrant workers and has a long and well known career in this field. And I'm pleased to have all three of them with me today. 
I also wish to thank the other members of the delegation who are not here, but who will also be attending: former Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson, William Cardinal Keeler of Baltimore, and Dr. Maha Hussein, and Iraqi-American who will also be part of the delegation. 
The choice of such an expert, high-level delegation testifies to the seriousness with which the American people take the fight against racism and discrimination within our society and worldwide. U.S. leadership at the conference will be key to reaching agreement on recommendations to promote tolerance and respect for diversity. And President Bush and I have every confidence that Secretary Jackson and his outstanding delegation will make lasting contributions to the success of the conference and to the cause of human dignity and equality. 
And now I would invite Secretary Jackson to say a word or two. 
SECRETARY JACKSON: Thank you very much, Secretary Powell. I am honored that President Bush has asked me to lead the U.S. delegation to Brussels. 
Following the conference, we anticipate that the countries of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe will negotiate a new and specific commitment by their government to combat discrimination and promote tolerance. 
It is critical that the governments enforce anti-discrimination laws, train their law enforcement authorities, gather statistics on hate crimes; more importantly, they need to speak out publicly and forcefully when hate crimes occur in their respective countries. 
The conference comes as a direct response to the increase we've seen around the world during the past decade to intolerance and hate crimes. The 55 nations from Europe, Eurasia, North America will come together in Brussels determined to address the increase in hate crimes. We will share ideas of how to combat these crimes. 
As you know, the United States has struggled with its own history of prejudice and intolerance. But we've taken many steps to address those past and failing issues. I look forward to sharing the American experience with my colleagues abroad and learn all that we can from their experience as well as they can learn from ours. 
Thank you so much. 
SECRETARY POWELL: We have time for one or two questions if there are any. 
QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, 
SECRETARY POWELL: Yeah. 
QUESTION: What is your -- we've just heard in the past decade there's been an increase. Do you have a feel for whether racism is on the increase or -- in your last -- in your four years here, what you have seen? I mean around the world, of course. 
SECRETARY POWELL: Yeah. It's hard to measure it that way to say it's increased and decreased. I think what I have seen is that in specific areas there have been increases that should be of concern to us, anti-Semitism in some parts of Europe and anti-Muslim attitudes in some parts of the world. But whether I can tell you, as a worldwide phenomenon, it's gone up or down, I don't know. 
I think there has been increasing signs of tolerance in other parts of the world, where people recognize that diversity should be a source of strength, not a source of weakness. 
QUESTION: Mr. Secretary -- 
SECRETARY POWELL: Somebody I haven't seen in quite a while, Andrea. 
QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, I'd like to get your response, sir, to some comments that were made by the Russian President, Vladimir Putin, responding to the recent actions, the recent terrorist acts in Russia and in the Caucasus. He said that the U.S. policy, the U.S. continuing to push for a political solution in Chechnya, is a double standard. Why, in your estimation, is it not a double standard? 
SECRETARY POWELL: I think that all parties, to include the Russian Federation, have been looking for a political solution to the crisis in Chechnya. I think President Putin is making reference to occasional visits, not one recently, but some time ago, of Chechen personalities to staff members in the State Department as part of our way of keeping informed about the situation in the region. 
Where we are now absolutely united, though, is in condemning this horrible, horrible action that took place in this small town. I went over to the Russian Embassy earlier today to express our deepest condolences. I did it on behalf of President and Mrs. Bush and the American people and to let the people of Russia, the people of Beslan, know that we stand with them. Terrorism of this kind has no place in the world. To take children and to put children at risk and to murder them in this deliberate manner has to be condemned. 
The civilized world condemns it and all other forms of terrorism, and we will work closely with the Russian authorities in any way that we can to deal with this matter. We have provided, as you know, some medical assistance and some other supplies that they needed and we look forward to the results of their investigation to see what it tells us about the perpetrators. 
QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, foreign ministers of India and Pakistan met in Delhi this week, or yesterday, but the problem between the two countries that India is saying that Kashmir should not be the core issue, but Pakistan is saying that Kashmir is the core issue. 
Do you see a solution, sir, for Kashmir? And also, what part are you taking now because it has been going on for 55 years now. How long the childrens of both countries will be suffering and so many people have been killed and will continue killed? 
SECRETARY POWELL: I spoke to both ministers late last week before they had their meeting and I was pleased to learn from both of them that they are entering into this dialogue in a positive way. Both ministers recognize that Kashmir is an issue among many issues that have to be dealt with between the two nations. 
I am pleased that they are actually talking to one another at this level and at any many other levels and that the environment for positive discussions has improved so greatly over the last year and a half, two years. You'll recall less than about two years ago we were concerned about a major conflict between the two nations and now they are in discussions with one another. 
Kashmir is a very difficult issue. It will take time to resolve. Both parties know that it has to be dealt with and it is part of their agenda. 
QUESTION: But, sir, people in both countries, 1.3 billion people -- 
SECRETARY POWELL: Thank you. 
QUESTION: -- people are saying that Kashmir should not be the core issue because there are other issues. 
SECRETARY POWELL: Both parties, as I've said, realize it's an issue on the agenda. They have both acknowledged it. And this is the first meeting between these two ministers, ministers of the two countries in a fairly long period of time. So let's take heart in the reality that they are discussing all issues between the two countries, of which Kashmir is one, and both have acknowledged that. 
QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, on Iran, last week you said that now was the time to take this matter to the UN Security Council. What's your judgment now? Do you have sufficient support for that on the IAEA Board of Governors? And secondly, are you at all inclined toward a reported deal with Iran under which would cease a lot of centrifuge activity that it has already promised a number of times to stop and has then said it will pursue? 
SECRETARY POWELL: As you recall, we thought it should have been referred to the Security Council last November. But other colleagues of mine, particularly, the European Union-3, wanted to engage Iran and find a solution. They have been working on that for the last -- almost a year, and unfortunately, I don't think the response from Iran has been very positive or constructive, either to what the EU-3 commitments were or to the IAEA. 
We believe that we have seen enough that action is warranted, and the IAEA should refer the matter to the Security Council at its upcoming meeting next week. We'll have to see what the overall judgment is among the IAEA members, 35 members on the Board, and I won't prejudge what they will do. But there is another meeting in November, but we believe time is -- time is passing and this is a matter that should go to the Security Council as quickly as possible. 
With respect to reports that Iran is prepared to do something in response to some offer or some kind of bargain, I've seen those reports, but I'd be more interested in seeing Iranian action to stop the steps that they say they are now embarking upon with respect to the production of materials that, in our judgment, leads to a nuclear weapons -- gives evidence of a nuclear weapons program, which one must assume could lead to the development, production of a nuclear weapon, which I think would be very destabilizing. 
QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, how close are you to making a determination on genocide in Sudan, and are you at all encouraged by your conversations with UN Security Council members about a strong resolution on the Government of Sudan? 
SECRETARY POWELL: I think that we need to take a look at what has happened in the region over the last month since the UN resolution was passed. We've seen improvement with respect to humanitarian access, and we need more and more humanitarian organizations to get involved. We need those who have made financial commitments to meet those commitments and put the cash into the system. 
The security situation isn't as improved as we would like it to be, and we hope that the Security Council will be looking at this very, very closely to see what additional action or additional resolutions might be appropriate, and we're looking at language. I'm in touch with all of my principal colleagues in the Security Council on this matter. 
With respect to the issue of what to call it -- genocide or not -- let me begin by saying that genocide, if it is so declared, or an international organization so declares it, does not open any new doors that are not available to us now. So we are deeply engaged in this with both our political and diplomatic efforts with the money we're putting to it. 
The team that we sent over to interview people who have been forced out of their homes has returned. I do have their report, and I'll be studying it in considerable depth over the next day or so, and I'll be testifying on the subject on Thursday before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 
One more. 
QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Israeli helicopters and war planes -- 
SECRETARY POWELL: Don't assume there is something to announce. (Laughter.) What I said was I will make judgments over the next day or two and you will get the results of my judgment when I appear before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. I didn't want to have you go down the wrong road. (Laughter.) 
Yes. 
QUESTION: Thank you. Israeli helicopters and war planes hit a training camp, Hamas training camp in Gaza, killing 14, and now Hamas is promising to retaliate; and also Israel is extending the security wall 30 more kilometers after the Beersheba incident or attack. Do you think this is -- these kinds of actions are helpful, retaliation and hitting? 
SECRETARY POWELL: No, I don't think they're helpful and I don't think the -- the situation is very tragic. There is a way to get out of this. It's called the roadmap. Both sides have obligations that they have to meet under the roadmap. We've got to get it started. We believe that Prime Minister Sharon's plan to begin with the removal of the Gaza settlements and some of the West Bank settlements give us an opportunity. 
We have asked the Palestinian Authority to empower the Prime Minister so that the Prime Minister has control of all of the security organizations of the Palestinian Authority and can use that power and those organizations to crack down on terrorism. Unfortunately, we have not seen that. 
And we are also, of course, in touch with the Israelis with respect to their obligations under the roadmap as well. But until we get this roadmap process going, these kinds of things happen and they're tragic whenever they do happen, and retaliation is not a solution to the problems that we face in the region. 
Thank you.

2004/946

SECRETARY POWELL: Well, good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. As President Bush has said, the United States of America stands for the non-negotiable demands of human dignity. That is why we place such a high importance on the conference and the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe, a conference that will be held on tolerance and the fight against racism, xenophobia and discrimination which the Belgian Government will graciously host in Brussels on September 13th and 14th. You may recall that we also sent a strong delegation to last year's conference under the leadership of former Congressman J.C. Watts.

We do this because we applaud the OSCE's pioneering work in fighting intolerance, reflected earlier this year in the Berlin Conference on Anti-Semitism which I had the privilege to attend and represent the United States at.

The upcoming conference in Brussels is an important opportunity to further raise public awareness of the rise in hate crimes and other acts of intolerance that have occurred in Europe and North America this year. The United States is honored that my friend and cabinet colleague, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Alphonso Jackson, will lead a distinguished delegation to the conference. Secretary Jackson has a long history of activism in key areas of civil rights, education and community development.

Secretary Jackson will be joined by Mr. Robert Woodson, Sr., who is also present with us today, of the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, and Ms. Tamar Jacoby of The Manhattan Institute, who is also with us today, who has championed the plight of migrant workers and has a long and well known career in this field. And I'm pleased to have all three of them with me today.

I also wish to thank the other members of the delegation who are not here, but who will also be attending: former Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson, William Cardinal Keeler of Baltimore, and Dr. Maha Hussein, and Iraqi-American who will also be part of the delegation.

The choice of such an expert, high-level delegation testifies to the seriousness with which the American people take the fight against racism and discrimination within our society and worldwide. U.S. leadership at the conference will be key to reaching agreement on recommendations to promote tolerance and respect for diversity. And President Bush and I have every confidence that Secretary Jackson and his outstanding delegation will make lasting contributions to the success of the conference and to the cause of human dignity and equality.

And now I would invite Secretary Jackson to say a word or two.

SECRETARY JACKSON: Thank you very much, Secretary Powell. I am honored that President Bush has asked me to lead the U.S. delegation to Brussels.

Following the conference, we anticipate that the countries of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe will negotiate a new and specific commitment by their government to combat discrimination and promote tolerance.

It is critical that the governments enforce anti-discrimination laws, train their law enforcement authorities, gather statistics on hate crimes; more importantly, they need to speak out publicly and forcefully when hate crimes occur in their respective countries.

The conference comes as a direct response to the increase we've seen around the world during the past decade to intolerance and hate crimes. The 55 nations from Europe, Eurasia, North America will come together in Brussels determined to address the increase in hate crimes. We will share ideas of how to combat these crimes.

As you know, the United States has struggled with its own history of prejudice and intolerance. But we've taken many steps to address those past and failing issues. I look forward to sharing the American experience with my colleagues abroad and learn all that we can from their experience as well as they can learn from ours.

Thank you so much.

SECRETARY POWELL: We have time for one or two questions if there are any.

QUESTION: Mr. Secretary,

SECRETARY POWELL: Yeah.

QUESTION: What is your -- we've just heard in the past decade there's been an increase. Do you have a feel for whether racism is on the increase or -- in your last -- in your four years here, what you have seen? I mean around the world, of course.

SECRETARY POWELL: Yeah. It's hard to measure it that way to say it's increased and decreased. I think what I have seen is that in specific areas there have been increases that should be of concern to us, anti-Semitism in some parts of Europe and anti-Muslim attitudes in some parts of the world. But whether I can tell you, as a worldwide phenomenon, it's gone up or down, I don't know.

I think there has been increasing signs of tolerance in other parts of the world, where people recognize that diversity should be a source of strength, not a source of weakness.

QUESTION: Mr. Secretary --

SECRETARY POWELL: Somebody I haven't seen in quite a while, Andrea.

QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, I'd like to get your response, sir, to some comments that were made by the Russian President, Vladimir Putin, responding to the recent actions, the recent terrorist acts in Russia and in the Caucasus. He said that the U.S. policy, the U.S. continuing to push for a political solution in Chechnya, is a double standard. Why, in your estimation, is it not a double standard?

SECRETARY POWELL: I think that all parties, to include the Russian Federation, have been looking for a political solution to the crisis in Chechnya. I think President Putin is making reference to occasional visits, not one recently, but some time ago, of Chechen personalities to staff members in the State Department as part of our way of keeping informed about the situation in the region.

Do you see a solution, sir, for Kashmir? And also, what part are you taking now because it has been going on for 55 years now. How long the childrens of both countries will be suffering and so many people have been killed and will continue killed?

Colin Powell,20020822,Remarks with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov (1350 hrs),"[audio] 

SECRETARY POWELL: Well, good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. It was again a great pleasure for me to receive my colleague, Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, here at the State Department. This is our eighth meeting. We have met in Cairo, in Rome, Budapest, Brussels, Hanoi, Washington twice, and I have promised him that our next meeting will be in Moscow, unless we happen to meet in Crawford, Texas, or somewhere -- or in Shanghai. 
So it's part of a long series of discussions and constant phone calls that have allowed us to develop a solid relationship, not only between our two ministries, but between our two countries. And today was no exception. We spoke about terrorism at considerable length. I was very pleased to receive from the Minister expressions of condolence for those who lost their lives at the World Trade Center and at the Pentagon last week. 
Deputy Secretary Armitage called me from Moscow this morning to also tell me what it was like in Moscow to have Russian citizens coming by our embassy to place flowers and candles and otherwise remember those who lost their lives. 
We had a good discussion of potential areas of cooperation as we go after this worldwide threat to civilization, and a comprehensive campaign where all elements of national and international power must be used: law enforcement, military activity, legal actions, financial actions, anything that can be used to get at these terrorist organizations. In the first instance, al-Qaida and Mr. Usama bin Laden, but ultimately terrorism wherever it rears its ugly head. 
We also had a full discussion of regional issues, Iran, Iraq, Macedonia and other areas of interest to us, and we had a good discussion as well of the conversations we have been having between our two sides on a new strategic framework. And I think we are moving in the right direction. We have not solved the problem yet of how we can find a new strategic framework to go forward. But I think in our conversations today and the conversations that Under Secretary Bolton and Assistant Secretary Fife of the Pentagon have had with Russian military officials and Defense Ministry officials and Foreign Affairs Ministry officials, we can begin to see a way ahead that will increase stability and lead us in the direction of a new strategic framework. 
So, once again, Igor, a great pleasure to receive you, sir. 
FOREIGN MINISTER IVANOV: (As translated.) First of all, on behalf of the President of Russia and on behalf of the entire Russian people, I would like to once again express sincere condolences to the people of the United States over the tragedy which occurred on the 11th of September in the United States. There is no doubt that this crime, unprecedented in its scale, goes far beyond the borders of the United States. 
The international terrorism has caused a blatant challenge to all civilized humanity, to all civilized world. This reaffirms once again the urgent necessity to join efforts of the entire international community in the fight against new challenges and threats, including in the first place the threat of international terrorism. 
Russia and the United States have agreed to closely coordinate their actions in these areas. We will be coordinating our efforts within the framework of appropriate agencies as well as within the framework of appropriate working groups that have already been established and that have already been working between the United States and Russia. 
At the same time, we believe that it's high time that we established by joint efforts a global system to counteract global threats and challenges. And we believe that the work on establishing such global system must begin as early as today. 
We also place the main focus of our negotiations today on the preparations for the forthcoming summit meetings between the Presidents of Russia and the United States in Shanghai during the summit of APEC as well as the preparations of the first official visit of Russian President Putin to the United States. 
We are satisfied with the fact that the relations between Russia and the United States are gaining positive dynamics. This has become possible, first of all, thanks to the summit meetings that our Presidents, the Presidents of Russia and the United States, conducted in Ljubljana and Genoa. And we are convinced that the forthcoming meetings between our Presidents will give a further impetus, a further impulse to our relations. 
As the Secretary of State of the United States has just pointed out, we are conducting intensive consultations on the entire scope of issues relating to strategic security. On some of the issues, our positions are becoming closer. On the other issues, we are continuing active consultations. We have agreed to continue these consultations to be able to report the first results during the forthcoming summits of our Presidents. 
We have also discussed regional conflicts. First of all, we expressed some optimism in connection with a decrease of tensions, with some decrease of tension in the Middle East. Both Russia and the United States are in favor of beginning direct dialogue between Peres and Arafat to begin practical implementation of the Mitchell Plan. 
We have discussed also a number of other issues on which we are closely cooperating. I would like to specifically underscore that the negotiations were conducted in an open and constructive atmosphere. And I would like to thank personally for this, Mr. Secretary of State. 
SECRETARY POWELL: Thank you very much. I just might add that earlier today, I spoke to both Chairman Arafat and to Prime Minister Sharon and expressed my satisfaction that the first 24 hours of the arrangement they made yesterday has resulted in a significant decrease in the amount of violence in the region. I encouraged both sides to keep moving in this direction. 
The Prime Minister advised me that he had talked to Mr. Peres earlier with the same message. Prime Minister Sharon noted that, for the first time in many, many months, he has seen quiet since midnight of last night. And let us all hope that we can keep this process now moving forward and it will result in an early meeting between Foreign Minister Peres and Chairman Arafat. 
We have time for just a couple of questions. 
QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, can I ask you -- can I ask both of you -- there is obviously concern, as well as support, among your allies about the scale of any future American military action. Can you offer any reassurance to your allies about what you are planning? 
And Foreign Minister Ivanov, have you had any words of caution to add? 
SECRETARY POWELL: We are approaching this not as a single battle to be fought by the military but as a campaign that will involve all of our elements of national power. And we will be discussing with our friends and allies in the days ahead exactly how we think this campaign should unfold. 
With respect to the military component of such a campaign, I would not of course get into any of the details. But we know that there are some of our friends who are in a position to participate in such operations, and others who really will just provide us other kinds of support, whether it's diplomatic support, political support or working with the international police and intelligence activities. So at this time, I am not prepared to describe what the nature of any of our military planning might be. 
FOREIGN MINISTER IVANOV: (As translated.) As Mr. Secretary of State has already said, we have not discussed concrete issues related to possible reaction of the United States to these events. At the same time, we share common position that we need to strengthen international cooperation in combating international terrorism. All means must be used in the fight against terrorism, beginning from political and legal means and including, when and if necessary, use of force. 
We maintain constant contacts through our specialized services and between our foreign ministries. We have ongoing information exchanges, and we will continue to maintain our constant, close contact on all these issues. 
QUESTION: You mentioned that the United States is willing to fight international terrorism anywhere. Does that include Chechnya? Because Russia faced international terrorism much earlier than September the 11th. 
And a question to the Foreign Minister. (In Russian.) 
SECRETARY POWELL: We have discussed this on many occasions. Russia is facing a difficult challenge in Chechnya and we know it's a challenge they must respond to, and we will do what we can to help. But, at the same time, we have always encouraged our Russian colleagues to work hard to find a political solution to this tragic conflict, and also to defend their interests in a way that are consistent with human rights and other standards. But we recognize the serious challenge faced by Russia in Chechnya. 
FOREIGN MINISTER IVANOV: (As translated.) I have said that, in combating international terrorism, no means can be excluded, including the use of force. At the same time, so far, we have not discussed with the United States any specific, any concrete actions. 
QUESTION: Will you be requiring a UN resolution before joining in any military action? 
SECRETARY POWELL: There is a UN resolution that was passed last week. And as we go forward in the development of this campaign, if we see a need for additional UN resolutions to authorize certain actions, not necessarily military actions but other actions such as with respect to fighting international terrorism or going after financial support of international terrorism, we would certainly bring such proposals to the United Nations. 
FOREIGN MINISTER IVANOV: (As translated.) You know, the United Nations has already passed a large number of documents related to combating international terrorism. If I'm not mistaken, there are as many documents as 12 on this issue. We believe that the United Nations shall continue to play a leading role in joining in concerting the efforts, in combining the efforts of the international community in the fight against international terrorism. 
SECRETARY POWELL: We have time for just one more before the Minister has to go see the President. 
QUESTION: Is the United States going to send troops to Afghanistan? 
SECRETARY POWELL: When we have decided what our entire campaign plan is, to include any military actions we might take, the world will know about it. But I am not prepared to discuss any potential military operations at this time. 
Thank you very much. 
QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, time for one more? 
SECRETARY POWELL: I have to get to the White House. 
QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, did the Russians make any linkages whatsoever, whether it be with Chechnya, national missile defense, with NATO expansion? Were there any requests on their side? 
SECRETARY POWELL: We talked about all of these items, as we always do, missile defense, ABM, Chechnya. But they presented no linkages between that and the current incident. The current tragedy that we are dealing with, they were very forthcoming, they want to be helpful, and they didn't put any specific requests or bills or links on the table. 
Thank you.





SECRETARY POWELL: Well, good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. It was again a great pleasure for me to receive my colleague, Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, here at the State Department. This is our eighth meeting. We have met in Cairo, in Rome, Budapest, Brussels, Hanoi, Washington twice, and I have promised him that our next meeting will be in Moscow, unless we happen to meet in Crawford, Texas, or somewhere -- or in Shanghai.

Russia and the United States have agreed to closely coordinate their actions in these areas. We will be coordinating our efforts within the framework of appropriate agencies as well as within the framework of appropriate working groups that have already been established and that have already been working between the United States and Russia.

At the same time, we believe that it's high time that we established by joint efforts a global system to counteract global threats and challenges. And we believe that the work on establishing such global system must begin as early as today.

We also place the main focus of our negotiations today on the preparations for the forthcoming summit meetings between the Presidents of Russia and the United States in Shanghai during the summit of APEC as well as the preparations of the first official visit of Russian President Putin to the United States.

We are satisfied with the fact that the relations between Russia and the United States are gaining positive dynamics. This has become possible, first of all, thanks to the summit meetings that our Presidents, the Presidents of Russia and the United States, conducted in Ljubljana and Genoa. And we are convinced that the forthcoming meetings between our Presidents will give a further impetus, a further impulse to our relations.

As the Secretary of State of the United States has just pointed out, we are conducting intensive consultations on the entire scope of issues relating to strategic security. On some of the issues, our positions are becoming closer. On the other issues, we are continuing active consultations. We have agreed to continue these consultations to be able to report the first results during the forthcoming summits of our Presidents.

We have also discussed regional conflicts. First of all, we expressed some optimism in connection with a decrease of tensions, with some decrease of tension in the Middle East. Both Russia and the United States are in favor of beginning direct dialogue between Peres and Arafat to begin practical implementation of the Mitchell Plan.

We have discussed also a number of other issues on which we are closely cooperating. I would like to specifically underscore that the negotiations were conducted in an open and constructive atmosphere. And I would like to thank personally for this, Mr. Secretary of State.

SECRETARY POWELL: Thank you very much. I just might add that earlier today, I spoke to both Chairman Arafat and to Prime Minister Sharon and expressed my satisfaction that the first 24 hours of the arrangement they made yesterday has resulted in a significant decrease in the amount of violence in the region. I encouraged both sides to keep moving in this direction.

The Prime Minister advised me that he had talked to Mr. Peres earlier with the same message. Prime Minister Sharon noted that, for the first time in many, many months, he has seen quiet since midnight of last night. And let us all hope that we can keep this process now moving forward and it will result in an early meeting between Foreign Minister Peres and Chairman Arafat.

We have time for just a couple of questions.

QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, can I ask you -- can I ask both of you -- there is obviously concern, as well as support, among your allies about the scale of any future American military action. Can you offer any reassurance to your allies about what you are planning?

And Foreign Minister Ivanov, have you had any words of caution to add?

SECRETARY POWELL: We are approaching this not as a single battle to be fought by the military but as a campaign that will involve all of our elements of national power. And we will be discussing with our friends and allies in the days ahead exactly how we think this campaign should unfold.

With respect to the military component of such a campaign, I would not of course get into any of the details. But we know that there are some of our friends who are in a position to participate in such operations, and others who really will just provide us other kinds of support, whether it's diplomatic support, political support or working with the international police and intelligence activities. So at this time, I am not prepared to describe what the nature of any of our military planning might be.

FOREIGN MINISTER IVANOV: (As translated.) As Mr. Secretary of State has already said, we have not discussed concrete issues related to possible reaction of the United States to these events. At the same time, we share common position that we need to strengthen international cooperation in combating international terrorism. All means must be used in the fight against terrorism, beginning from political and legal means and including, when and if necessary, use of force.

We maintain constant contacts through our specialized services and between our foreign ministries. We have ongoing information exchanges, and we will continue to maintain our constant, close contact on all these issues.

QUESTION: You mentioned that the United States is willing to fight international terrorism anywhere. Does that include Chechnya? Because Russia faced international terrorism much earlier than September the 11th.

And a question to the Foreign Minister. (In Russian.)

SECRETARY POWELL: We have discussed this on many occasions. Russia is facing a difficult challenge in Chechnya and we know it's a challenge they must respond to, and we will do what we can to help. But, at the same time, we have always encouraged our Russian colleagues to work hard to find a political solution to this tragic conflict, and also to defend their interests in a way that are consistent with human rights and other standards. But we recognize the serious challenge faced by Russia in Chechnya.

FOREIGN MINISTER IVANOV: (As translated.) I have said that, in combating international terrorism, no means can be excluded, including the use of force. At the same time, so far, we have not discussed with the United States any specific, any concrete actions.

QUESTION: Will you be requiring a UN resolution before joining in any military action?

SECRETARY POWELL: There is a UN resolution that was passed last week. And as we go forward in the development of this campaign, if we see a need for additional UN resolutions to authorize certain actions, not necessarily military actions but other actions such as with respect to fighting international terrorism or going after financial support of international terrorism, we would certainly bring such proposals to the United Nations.

FOREIGN MINISTER IVANOV: (As translated.) You know, the United Nations has already passed a large number of documents related to combating international terrorism. If I'm not mistaken, there are as many documents as 12 on this issue. We believe that the United Nations shall continue to play a leading role in joining in concerting the efforts, in combining the efforts of the international community in the fight against international terrorism.

SECRETARY POWELL: We have time for just one more before the Minister has to go see the President.

QUESTION: Is the United States going to send troops to Afghanistan?

SECRETARY POWELL: When we have decided what our entire campaign plan is, to include any military actions we might take, the world will know about it. But I am not prepared to discuss any potential military operations at this time.

Thank you very much.

QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, time for one more?

SECRETARY POWELL: I have to get to the White House.

QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, did the Russians make any linkages whatsoever, whether it be with Chechnya, national missile defense, with NATO expansion? Were there any requests on their side?

SECRETARY POWELL: We talked about all of these items, as we always do, missile defense, ABM, Chechnya. But they presented no linkages between that and the current incident. The current tragedy that we are dealing with, they were very forthcoming, they want to be helpful, and they didn't put any specific requests or bills or links on the table.

Thank you.

Colin Powell,20030821,Remarks at The Elliott School of International Affairs,"[DSL/Cable] [dial-up] [audio]

[DSL/Cable]

Thank you all very much, and thank you for that wonderful GW welcome. It's great to be back on campus on this very, very special occasion. And, Emily, I thank you for that most touching and gracious introduction. Madame Marshal, Chairman Harding, the distinguished gynecologist Dr. Trachtenberg -- (laughter and applause) -- President Elliott, members of the faculty, other members of the GW family who are here, Mrs. Trachtenberg, Mrs. Elliott, it really is a great delight to be with you and a great delight especially to be with the young people, the students who are here to learn, here to prepare themselves for positions of leadership in this great country of ours.

I can't tell you what a privilege it was for me a few moments ago to dedicate a new building to serve the Elliott School of International Affairs of the wonderful George Washington University.

Public buildings such as the new building are not just simply concrete and glass, not just building materials. An architect gives a building its design, and those who first labor in it raise up its spirit. That design and that spirit together give character to the life of the building, and the building in turn influences those who inhabit its halls, its rooms.



We have just come from 1957 E Street, where the new building stands. I pray that those who will pass though its portals over the many years to come will be shaped by wisdom and by a dedication to serve society. We are now assembled here at Lisner Auditorium, and that's fine, and really it's quite appropriate because our business today transcends more than just a single new building. As Dean Harding noted, this month we also celebrate the Elliott School's 15th anniversary, and the 105th anniversary of GW's International Affairs program. And so my congratulations to the entire George Washington University family on these outstanding achievements.

And I am so proud to be a member of that GW family. I am at home here. I received, as you heard, an honorary doctorate in February of 1990, when I was Dr. Trachtenberg's first commencement speaker. It's hard to believe, Steve, that 13 years have passed between that occasion and this. But I do believe that you have used those years well. It shows in many achievements, large and small, the construction that we see all over this part of town, the improvements that have been made in the curriculum, the thriving nature of the academic community that you have built here.

And so, Steve, I want to take this opportunity to thank you and Mrs. Trachtenberg for the dedication that you have given to this school, to your community, and to this wonderful city of ours. Thank you, Steve. (Applause.)



The honorary doctorate was easy. The MBA was a little more difficult. (Laughter.) And as you heard mentioned earlier, I received my letter of acceptance on June 15th, 1969, while I was in Vietnam.



Earlier that day I had been out at a landing zone -- not far from a place called Duc Pho, watching a rifle company return from patrol in the Vietnamese jungle. I was already in some ways in a kind of graduate school, the graduate school of war, a school, a place, where people were shooting at you.

On that day, I only had three weeks left to my second Vietnam tour and, of course, I was anxious to return home, return to my family. And thanks to that letter from GW, I now knew where I was headed. I was happy for that, but the first semester here was not easy-going for me. I was the oldest student in our program, seeking an MBA in data processing, a subject I knew nothing about. The Army said we had to learn about these newfangled things called computers -- and, Powell, you're going to learn about it, and if we throw you out later you will have a second skill that you can take into civilian life. (Laughter.) But I lacked much of the background one needed for such a program. I didn't have the economics or the math, the statistics. I was bewildered, and worried that the university had somehow made a mistake in admitting me. And after they took a look at my undergraduate record from the City College of New York, they were also contemplating whether they had made a mistake in admitting me. (Laughter.)



To make matters worse, I was a career Army guy now in civilian drag on campus at the height of the Vietnam war movement.

But things turned around, as they usually did. I had a great two years here. It was an important period in my life. My third child was born while I was a student here. I saw turmoil in my country. I watched riots in the city. I saw tear gas float across this campus. I've often told people that those early years of the '70s were perhaps the darkest periods in my life with respect to how my country was doing and going. But things turned around for me in a personal way at GW, and a few years later, with changes in government and with President Ford coming in, we got through that terrible period. It proves again that bleak evenings almost always, in our wonderful land with our wonderful system, bleak evenings can always give way to bright mornings. So I worked hard here, kept faith, left with a pretty good record, and was even encouraged to pursue a doctoral degree, and perhaps join the faculty. But I decided I better go back to that which I really knew something about, and that was soldiering.

Now why have I lingered on this? Why have I spoken about Vietnam, about my shaky early experience? Am I trying to ingratiate myself with you on the cheap? Yeah, sure I am. (Laughter.) But there are serious points that I want you to take away from this experience, points that may apply to our country as well as to our individual lives. Perhaps the most important is that it really does take all kinds to make a world, and Steve touched on this earlier -- scholars, soldiers, policymakers. Not all of us are cut out to be scholars or a soldier or policymaker.

And that's fine, because American freedom, American democracy, requires all sorts of people, all sorts of partnerships, between policymakers and universities, between scholars and soldiers. Our different talents unite to form our nation's strength.

This is a truth that also applies to the affairs of state. Making American foreign policy involves a mix of perspectives and experiences, as well. On the Bush Administration national security team, the diversity of our talents, I believe, forms our strength. We are a strong team, and the President is the leader of that team. It is his foreign policy, driven by his vision of a better world, a better world that we can help shape. It is a vision that is firmly rooted in the values, hopes and principles of the electorate, the people, the American people who brought him to high office.

But a vision isn't enough. The President needs a strategy to design and execute foreign policy. And by strategy, I don't mean 19th century ""grand strategy,"" that classical kind of strategy that used to be characteristic of an imperial sense of the world. And the reason I don't mean that is because the United States does not seek a territorial empire. We have never been imperialists. We seek a world in which liberty, prosperity and peace can become the heritage of all peoples, and not just the exclusive privilege of a few.

And by strategy here, I do mean the translation of the President's vision into policies, policies that are coherent and that will appeal to the needs of the world, the desires of people in need throughout the world. And the translation requires the establishment of priorities, and that's critical because it is through priorities that a foreign policy strategy transforms vision into reality. President Bush has a vision. He has established priorities. His policies are unified by a strategy -- which was laid out publicly about a year ago in a document called the National Security Strategy of the United States.

The National Security Strategy gained attention in the aftermath of 9/11 because it made explicit the concept of preemption -- and it made it explicit for obvious reasons. As the President says, and as anyone can understand, if you can see a clear and present threat, a danger coming at you, you do not wait for it to arrive. You deal with it. You preempt. You don't wait for it to strike. It is not a new concept, but it took on new meaning in light of the changed world we faced after 9/11.

But the President's National Security Strategy covers far more than just preemption.

Above all, the President's strategy is a strategy of partnerships. It strongly affirms the vital role of the partnerships that we have throughout the world -- our partnership with NATO, our partnership with the United Nations and with so many other precious alliances that we have created over the last 50 years.

And the President's strategy doesn't rest on old alliances. It calls for new partnerships, new alliances, to meet new challenges.

Some new partnerships are global in scope, and quite different from the old-fashioned security kinds of partnerships. I have in mind here the Global Trust Fund that we helped set up with the United Nations to fight the scourge of HIV/AIDS around the world. HIV/AIDS: the greatest killer on the face of the Earth today, the greatest weapon of mass destruction on the face of the Earth today. And the President has made this a centerpiece of his foreign policy strategy.

Other new things we are doing are regional, such as our Middle East Partnership Initiative, which provides assistance for educational, economic and political reform throughout the Arab world, so that we can say to the Arab people of the world and Muslims throughout the world that there is no reason you cannot transform your society in a way consistent with your religion, with your beliefs, but also founded on the individual rights of men and women, founded on democracy and free market concepts.

Free trade and new American initiatives for economic development also figure prominently in the President's strategy. Just the day before yesterday I stood with the President in the White House as we celebrated the completion of work on free trade agreements with Chile and Singapore, and he signed the legislation bringing them into effect. The Free Trade Area of the Americas, the expanded Africa Growth and Opportunity Act, and especially the Millennium Challenge Account, which provides billions of dollars of new development assistance to those nations most in need, those nations who are committed to democracy and openness and the individual rights of their citizens -- all of these are important initiatives in the President's approach to the world and his strategy for executing the vision that he has for a world that is better, a world that is freer, a world that has something for every one of God's children.



The President's strategy is rooted, above all, in the promotion of freedom and dignity throughout the world. ""America must stand firmly,"" the President wrote, ""for the non-negotiable demands of human dignity: the rule of law, limits to the absolute power of the state, free speech, freedom of worship, equal justice, respect for women and ethnic tolerance, and respect for private property."" Simple values so well known to us. We stand by these values. We share these values with the world, not for the purpose of imposing them on the world, but for the purpose of letting the light of our values shine before us so that others can see and learn from them.



Our efforts to control the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction are also an essential part of the President's strategy. These efforts led this past May to the Proliferation Security Initiative, an 11-nation effort, 11 nations coming together, and more will join, coming together to seize weapons of mass destruction-related materials that are in transit to countries of concern.

President Bush's strategy also demands that we play a role in helping to solve regional conflicts, that we not just sit back behind our oceans and not take note of problems that are out there that we can play a leadership role in solving. Not only do such conflicts cause so much suffering, they can spread. They can spread to envelop societies that are now at peace -- and they can stoke the fires of terrorism, as well. And nowhere is the American role in helping to resolve regional conflicts more important than in bringing Israelis and Palestinians to a stable peace settlement.

We have a plan. It's called the roadmap, and we stand by that roadmap. That roadmap has been agreed to by the Israelis and the Palestinians. It has been endorsed by an organization that we created, a new partnership we created, called the Quartet -- the United States, the United Nations, European Union, the Russian Federation. Also, Arab nations joining in support of the roadmap. Since the President brought the parties together at Aqaba, where they all came together to endorse the roadmap, we have made some progress down the road the peace. But not enough, and we need to redouble our efforts. We need to keep the pressure on both sides to do everything they can to get to that point where Israelis and Palestinians can live side by side in peace, Israelis in the state of Israel and Palestinians in a state of their own called Palestine.

It has not been an easy journey so far, and it will not be easy as we move ahead. Many problems remain. We support Palestinian Prime Minister Abbas' efforts to consolidate security forces all under his authority so he could go after those terrorist organizations within the Palestinian community who are destroying the dreams of the Palestinian people. We support Prime Minister Abbas' efforts to make sure that all financial authority and all financial resources are under his office so they can be used to benefit the Palestinian people and not be diverted to other purposes.

This is the way to stop, once and for all, Palestinian terrorist organizations like Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad from making peace itself a hostage to their hateful ambitions. This is the way to rebuild the Palestinian society and the Palestinian economy on a sound basis to benefit all Palestinians. This is the way to a Palestinian state.

Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad and similar organizations must be isolated. The entire international community must come together to isolate them, brand them as terrorists, and do everything we can to cut off all of the funding that has been going to these organizations over the years. Unfortunately, Chairman Yasser Arafat has not been playing a helpful role. He has not been an interlocutor for peace over the years. His actions do not move the parties farther down the road to peace.

Also unfortunate is the fact that while it takes two to make peace, it takes only one to prevent peace. If either of the parties turns away from its obligations under the roadmap, both will slide into a ditch or tumble over a cliff. Neither the Palestinians nor the Israelis like everything about the roadmap, but neither has an alternative that is both available and better.

The roadmap is sound, we stand by it, and we know the travelers will get to their common destination -- to peace -- if they follow that map.

Conflicts in other regions have also demanded our attention, and our compassion. The United States is engaged in so many places in the world to try to achieve solutions to regional conflicts. Whether it's in the Sudan or the Republic of Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo, we are hard at work. Most recently, we helped our friends in Africa bring the situation in Liberia under control. We supported ECOWAS, an African organization, West African states coming together. They came up with a political solution, they provided the troops to go in. We provided the support, the supplies, and a limited number of American troops to show our commitment, to show our dedication to this peacekeeping mission.

Now with our African friends, and with the United Nations and with the Liberians themselves, we are helping them to create a new government, a responsible government, to care for the needs of a desperate people.



But despite the breadth of our strategy, despite our policy concerns and the accomplishments that I think we've achieved, it is natural that the recent focus of U.S. foreign policy has centered on the global war against terrorism. Terrorism is a problem that has been there for years, but it hit home here on September 11th, 2001, whose second anniversary we will solemnly mark next Thursday. An outraged American people understandably wanted those responsible brought to justice.

And the President set us on the task not just to get the killers of 9/11, but to instead lead a global campaign against all terrorism, against all terrorists. He did this because he understood that terrorism is not just America's problem; it is everyone's problem, it is a problem for the civilized world, and the civilized world had to come together under his leadership to deal with it. Just in recent months, terrorist attacks have made far too many headlines, in far too many places. In a resort in Bali. In a bus full of children in Jerusalem. In a Bombay marketplace. At the United Nations headquarters in Baghdad. In front of a sacred mosque in Najaf, Iraq.

Our grief knows no borders. Neither does our determination to put an end to such outrages against innocent people. The war on terrorism is our number one priority, and it will remain so for as long as is necessary.

We are succeeding in the global war on terrorism. We are making progress. The victories of our armed forces in Afghanistan and Iraq form part of that success. So do quieter diplomatic victories that you may not hear about, or intelligence victories or legal victories, law enforcement victories, as we go about the world, go around the world, to go every country and encourage them to participate in shutting down funding of terrorists, making sure that we share intelligence and law enforcement information, so we can get to them, root them out, and make sure that they do not have the opportunity to conduct new terrorist attacks.

Our reconstruction and humanitarian efforts translate military victory into lasting political accomplishments, and we are doing that in Afghanistan and Iraq. Our efforts will not cease. They will not falter. We will not fail. Military victory is only part of the solution. It's the reconstruction that comes afterward that leaves us with a lasting peaceful situation.

In Afghanistan, both the political reach and governing capacities of President Karzai's administration are expanding. Roads and schools are being built. Dangerous land-mines are being cleared away. A national army and police force are coming into being. A state is being rebuilt before our eyes from the ashes of war and chaos.

We know that Afghanistan's challenges are too great to be overcome overnight. So the United States is determined to help for as long as it takes to overcome them, and we are asking other nations to join us in this effort. We will be accelerating in the next several weeks our support for Afghan development, and others around the world will be generously adding to their original contributions -- and not just with money. As you know, NATO assumed responsibility for security in Kabul just last month. One of our great partners, NATO, realized that even though NATO is a European-North Atlantic organization, it now has new responsibilities it must meet in parts of the world that could never have been contemplated NATO would have to participate in when the organization was formed so many years ago.

Afghanistan remains a dangerous and an unsettled place. But the remnants of the Taliban regime and of al-Qaida will be rooted out. And, together with our allies and the Afghan people themselves, Afghanistan will be rebuilt.

In Iraq, too, it is impossible to overcome in only a few months obstacles that have been decades in the making. Every day makes clearer how horribly the Iraqi people suffered under Saddam Hussein and the Baath Party. Their national resources were diverted. The oil treasure that they had was wasted as the regime spent the money on weapons, participated in the mass production of fear, repression, and the perverse luxuries of its insatiable elite. The mass graves that are now being opened up for the whole world to see bear witness to Saddam Hussein's brutality. Let there be no doubt in anyone's mind that we did the right thing, that the world is better off without this despotic regime.

And now the remnants who have been left behind are still acting in character, still acting in a despotic manner, trying to destroy the hopes of the Iraqi people, and destroying water and oil pipelines. They are attacking humanitarian workers in the international community that has come there to help the Iraqi people. They are trying to deny the Iraqi people the fruits of their liberation. But they will fail.

Some foreign terrorists, too, are coming to Iraq to help Iraq's own dead-enders with their destructive work. They will fail, too. Coalition forces are ready for them. We will find them. We will isolate them. And then they will be destroyed.



The forces of destruction, the forces of the tragic past, will not stop us. Together with our allies and, most of all, together with the Iraqi people, we are undoing the disasters of Saddam Hussein's misrule.

Electrical power is returning. On August 27, generating capacity reached 3,700 megawatts and will soon go over 4,000 megawatts, which was the amount of electricity that was there before the war.

All of Iraq's universities are open and most of its secondary schools are now open as well. Since the end of July, all of Iraq's major hospitals have been up and running, as have 95 percent of local clinics. Stocks of medicine and medical technology are being rapidly replenished.

The oil industry is getting back on its feet. Oil is now flowing out, money is flowing in. Crude oil production now averages between 1.4 and 1.7 million barrels a day.

Banks are making loans in Baghdad, employment is picking up, a free press bustles with energy and advertising. Of the country's 400 courts, 300 have now reopen. Approximately 46,000 police have been hired, and another 28,000 new police will be trained over the next 18 months.

Progress is being made, and because the Coalition is making such progress, far more Iraqis worry about our leaving too soon than about our staying too long. They need not worry, for we will neither leave too soon, nor stay too long.

As you have been reading in your newspapers for the last several days, we have begun consultations with our Security Council colleagues on a new UN resolution concerning Iraq. In this resolution we will invite the Iraqi Governing Council to submit a plan and a timetable for them to write a constitution, develop political institutions, and conduct free elections. All of this leading to their resumption of sovereignty over their country, over their own people.

This is our single goal, our only goal, to allow the Iraqi people to regain sovereignty, but sovereignty based on democracy, sovereignty based on freedom, sovereignty based on peaceful existence with one's neighbors. This has been the President's goal from the very beginning, and this new resolution will move us further along toward that goal.

There are some of my Security Council colleagues who would like to move faster, some who say be a little more careful. We will listen to all of the comments that will be coming in, and we will try to adjust and adapt to those comments, as long as it is consistent with what I have just described as our overall goal.

The resolution would also authorize a United Nations multilateral force, with a U.S. commander. There's nothing unusual about this. With a force this size and with the majority of that force coming from one country, that country is the provider of the commander. And we have seen this model work on many occasions in the past and we are confident it will work now -- keeping in mind there are already 30 nations standing side by side with us in Iraq, and we hope with this new resolution more nations will be encouraged to become a part of this noble effort.



The resolution would also permit the United Nations to play a more comprehensive and active role in the transition back to Iraqi sovereignty. We are receiving suggestions, as I said, and I look forward to working with our 14 partners on the Security Council to produce a new resolution as quickly as possible.

But we are doing more than that. We are looking, at an Iraq donors' conference in Madrid in October to further mobilize international efforts to help the Iraqi people reconstruct their country and rebuild their lives.

Our efforts will augment and encourage the most important kind of progress that is being made in Iraq, which is political progress. Iraqis are organizing themselves in so many ways now for self-government. Many municipal and village councils are operating according to representative principles. The Iraqi Governing Council recently named a 25-man cabinet, which was sworn in on Wednesday. It is already beginning to govern.

Behind every statistic and every political accomplishment is something that is even more important: the end of fear, and a new spirit of freedom being born. That spirit is spreading far and wide. In the end, it will prove unstoppable. In the end, democracy will come to Iraq. In the end, those who are trying to stop -- those who are conducting these terrorist attacks, those who don't realize that there is a new wave sweeping over that part of the world, they will be dealt with.

And democracy will come to Iraq. And when it does, all those in the Middle East who are in thrall to their own fears of change will be faced with a choice. They can move forward with the rest of the world, or stagnate in their own insecurities. Those imprisoned, not by Islam, certainly, but by a lack of confidence in their societies' ability to embrace a better future, will no longer be able to intimidate others into joining their cabals of the closed-minded.

That is a day to which the many lovers of liberty in the Middle East look forward to. And I hope that as long as we remain engaged, as we lead an international coalition, they will not be disappointed.

That will be a great day, indeed. But our efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq are not without cost. I know that the President is deeply grateful, as are we all, for the outstanding service and the painful sacrifices that American men and women in uniform are making in Iraq and in Afghanistan. We are grateful, too, for the service and sacrifices being made by the soldiers of dozens of other nations who are also contributing to the effort.



Every loss of life, every wound, is a tragedy. But not a loss in vain. Not to face up to and fight the hatred that is at the core of all terrorism, is to be complicit in hatred's consequences. That we will never be. Every loss that we suffer becomes a stone in the citadel we are building against terrorism, and against hatred. None of these lives have been lost in vain. As the Secretary of State, as an American citizen and as a former solider, I am so enormously proud of those wonderful young men and women that you see out there doing their job every day on behalf of the Iraqi people, on behalf of the cause of freedom and in the global war against terrorism. I hope you are as proud of them as I am. (Applause.)

Afghanistan, Iraq and the Arab-Israeli conflict have absorbed much of our energy in recent months. But by no means all. Less well appreciated and less visible in the daily headlines is the other work that we are at, other work that we are succeeding at, in other important domains of U.S. foreign policy. Not least among these is the focus we have placed on better relations with the world's major powers.

The world is much changed since I was a soldier in Germany, Vietnam and later in Korea, or even when I was a soldier here at GW. The world changed profoundly in November of 1989, when the Berlin Wall was breached, never to be repaired. That date marked the end of the Cold War and, before long, of the Soviet Union itself.

Those events ended the epoch of intense and dangerous struggle between liberty and totalitarianism that had shaped most of the 20th century. For most of the 20th century, it was fascism versus democracy, communism versus democracy. The potential of more world wars, in addition to the two world wars that we saw.

All that has changed. All that is complete different. The President fully understands the essence of what this means. As he wrote in his National Security Strategy, ""Today the international community has the best chance since the rise of the nation-state in the seventeenth century to build a world where great powers compete in peace instead of continually prepare for war. Today, the world's great powers find themselves on the same side.""

This is good news. For too many years, too many centuries, the imperial habits of great powers squandered untold resources and talent and lives jousting for real estate, glory and gold. Instead of wasting lives and treasure opposing each other as in the past, today's powers can pull in the same direction to solve problems common to all. If we do pull together, we will begin to redeem history from so much human folly.

One of those common problems, of course, is terrorism. We do not see the war against terrorism and the nurturing of constructive relations with the major powers as competing tasks. They are complementary. We conduct the war on terrorism with an eye toward greater major power cooperation. And we seek enhanced great power cooperation with an eye turned toward success in the war on terrorism.

The logic of this approach rests in the fact that terrorism threatens world order itself. But by so doing, it creates a common interest in defeating terrorism among all the powers of the world that value peace, prosperity and respect the rule of law. That common interest is one source of a rare and remarkable opportunity: America's chance to enjoy for the first time in a hundred years excellent relations with all the world's major powers simultaneously.

Of course, we have a head start in this, for America is blessed with many enduring great power friendships. None of these are more important than those great power relationships represented in NATO.

Some observers predicted when I was here as a student that NATO would wither after the Cold War, and that the United States and the European Union would end up on a collision course. It has not been so, and will not be so. I remember when I was Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on my last occasion here, people were saying, well, you know, ""Why do we still need a NATO?"" Some of my Russian general friends were saying, ""Look, if the Warsaw Pact goes away,"" they were saying in the early '90s, ""why do you still need NATO? No Warsaw Pact, no Soviet Union, no NATO."" And my answer was, ""It's hard to close a club where people are still asking for membership applications."" (Laughter.)

And so rather than withering, NATO has thrived. It's grown, gone from 16 to 19, now to 26 nations this coming year. And as for our relations with the European Union, never has our common agenda been so large and mutually beneficial -- from advancing free trade to counter-proliferation efforts.

And so let there be no doubt that the partnership we have with our European friends is a strong partnership. Yes, it is true that we have differences with some of our oldest and most valued NATO allies. But these are differences among friends. The Transatlantic partnership is based so firmly on common interests and values that neither feuding personalities nor divergent perceptions can derail it. We have new friends and old friends alike in Europe. They are all, in the end, friends, best friends.

That is why the President continues to talk about partnerships, not about polarities. Some authorities suggest that we must move to a multipolar world. But there need be no poles among nations that share basic values. We have no desire to create such poles, either. Indeed, we must work to overcome differences, not to polarize them.

We work hard to have the best relations with nations large and small, old and new. But it is important that we concentrate on those major powers, and especially on those with which we have had different and difficult relations over the years.

Our relationship with Russia and China and India fall into this category. And just look at where we are now. Our relationship with Russia has been dramatically transformed -- for the better -- since that November evening in 1989. Americans and Russians no longer point growing arsenals of strategic missiles at one another. Indeed, thanks to President Bush and President Putin's leadership, we are now radically reducing our strategic weapons' arsenals. In Moscow, we have a committed partner in fighting terrorism and in combating the spread of weapons of mass destruction worldwide.

U.S.-Russian commercial relations, too, have expanded, and will expand further to mutual benefit -- not least in the energy sector.

The new relationship that is developing between Russia and NATO, too, has real substance. From sharing intelligence on terrorism to working together to deal with humanitarian crises and peacekeeping tasks, the NATO-Russia Council is operational and working -- something that would have been absolutely unthinkable just 15 or so short years ago.

And that relationship with Russia can expand as far as our creativity and mutual effort will let it. We are closer than ever, with this new relationship with Russia and the other former republics of the Soviet Union, we are closer than ever to a Europe whole, free and at peace -- a Europe that definitely includes Russia, a Europe that will not in this century face the kinds of challenges that was faced in the century past.

Perhaps most important, American and Russian political and economic philosophies are converging. Russia today is more democratic than not. It is also more a market economy than not. We should be patient as Russia develops its democratic institutions, and as the painful hangover of Soviet-era corruption is rooted out and the rule of law firmly established.

We do not agree on everything. Earlier this year, we had hoped for a more supportive Russian attitude toward our Iraq policy. We still hope for more change in Russia's attitude toward the Iranian nuclear program. And we differ over aspects of Russian policy in Chechnya. But the relationship as a whole is no longer locked in knee-jerk antagonism. That's what is important. We now have the necessary level of trust required to solve even the most difficult issues that exist between us.

While Russia is still developing its democracy, India's democracy dates from its independence in 1947. And with recent economic reforms setting institutional roots, India is developing into a mature market economy. As Indians themselves are the first to admit, however, their country still faces many challenges. Illiteracy, poverty, many others, which hamper their progress.

We want to work with India. We want to help India overcome its challenges, and we want to help ourselves through a closer association with one of the world's richest and most ancient cultures. We have therefore worked very hard to deepen our relationship with India. The two largest democracies on earth are no longer estranged, as they had been for many years. At the same time, we have done this in a way that also allowed us to improve our relationship with Pakistan, a country with domestic challenges of its own.

Aside from their domestic challenges, India and Pakistan live with the legacy of their dispute over Kashmir. About 15 months ago, you will all recall, we were fearful of a major war breaking out on the subcontinent, possibly a nuclear war. A distinct possibility. So, once again, with our partners, we came together, and working with India and Pakistan we defused that crisis, and now we see the situation improving as they reach out to one another. And we look forward to helping them in every way that we can.

What the United States has done in South Asia is an example of ""turning adversity into opportunity"" -- to quote President Bush. In a different way, we have done the same thing with the other major power I'd like to touch on, China.

Sino-American relations didn't get off on the best foot in this administration. You will remember in April of 2001 there was an incident where we lost one of our airplanes in a collision with a Chinese plane and it landed on the island. We had a crisis on our hands. We got through that crisis in a two-week period, and every since then our relationship has been on the upswing, constantly going up. And today, I would submit U.S. relations with China are the best they have been since President Nixon's first visit.

This is not just because the 9/11 attacks led us to shuffle priorities. It's not just because we championed Chinese accession to the World Trade Organization. It's not just because a new generation of leadership is taking the Chinese ship of state in hand. It is certainly not because we've ignored basic differences we have with China on their human rights practices or their proliferation activities or the reluctance of China's leadership to match political reform to economic reform. We have not ignored these differences.

The relationship has improved for a reason that transcends all these particulars. It is that neither we nor the Chinese leadership anymore believe that there is anything inevitable about our relationship -- either inevitably bad or inevitably good.

We believe that it is up to us, together, to take responsibility for our common future. And we do not conceive that future in zero-sum terms. The National Security Strategy puts it directly: ""We welcome the emergence of a strong, peaceful and prosperous China."" And we seek a constructive relationship with that China. Indeed, we welcome a global role for China, so long as China assumes the responsibilities commensurate with that role.

Chinese leaders know all this. Neither false fear about the future nor the overhang of Cold War enmity prevents us from cooperating where our interests coincide. And a case in point concerns the Korean Peninsula.



American and Chinese interests in Korea may not overlap completely, but they do so considerably. Neither side wishes to see nuclear weapons developed and deployed by the North Koreans on the Peninsula. Neither side enjoys the specter of the chronicled debacle that is the North Korean economy. Neither side has any interest in a worsening refugee crisis on China's border. Neither side relishes a North Korean regime that runs drugs and weapons, and that counterfeits currencies, or that engages in the periodic extortion of its neighbors though brinksmanship military conduct. Neither side, to be sure, has any interest in another Korean war.

We have worked to transform our common interests with China into solid and productive cooperation over the challenges posed by North Korea. We are doing so, as well, in conjunction with Japan, Russia, and South Korea.

Our agenda is ambitious, but it is succeeding. The fact that we now have a six-party framework for talks over North Korea's nuclear program stands as testimony. Once again, we worked with partners. We found nations with like interests to ours with respect to Korea to come together and form this six-party grouping with includes the North Koreans. A very multilateral approach to diplomacy. And we very much appreciate the leadership role that the Chinese have played in trying to find a solution to this problem.

We still have a long way to go before we achieve success in dealing with North Korea's dangerous nuclear weapons program. We have no intention of invading or attacking North Korea, and we have told our partners and the North Koreans that. We have stated our intentions, openly and honestly: we want peace, not war; we want security, not fear, to envelop Korea and its neighbors. But we will not yield to threats and blackmail. We will not take any options off the table. Now is the time for North Korea to alter its behavior, to end its nuclear program in a verifiable manner.

I believe strongly that a diplomatic solution can be achieved, and when it has been achieved, we will have demonstrated that American diplomacy is designed to satisfy not only American national interests, but the interests of international security as well. We will show that the equities of other powers can be best advanced along with American ones, not in opposition to them.

And so we have a National Security Strategy that is based on a vision, a vision that includes strong partnerships, not unilateralism, but strong partnerships with our traditional allies and our new friends in the world stage. It includes a concern for the well-being of mankind throughout the world. We're investing in HIV/AIDS programs. We're doing everything we can with respect to economic development of developing nations, with respect to poverty elimination. It is a broad, broad, comprehensive strategy.

Ladies and gentlemen, our relations among the major nations of the world will remain a key structural element that will shape the future of international security. We must not take the present peace among the major powers for granted. That peace will not just take care of itself as time passes. We have to work at it, and we will. We will remain engaged.

Yes, of course we want to promote democracy in the world now. We want to help people raise themselves from poverty now. We want to transform the inadequate system of global public health now. We are in pursuit of these goals, too, now. But only if the deep peace of our era can be ""preserved, defended and expanded,"" can our long-term goals be achieved.

And make no mistake, these are the central goals of American foreign policy in the 21st century. We fight terrorism because we must. We seek a better world because we can, because it is our desire, it is our destiny to do so. That is why we devote ourselves to democracy, development, global public health, human rights -- as well as to the structure of global peace that enables us to pursue our vision for a better world.

These are not mere high-sounding decorations for our interests. They are our interests. They are the purposes that our power serves.

Because this is so, I know that America's reputation for honesty and compassion will endure. Today America's motives are impugned in some lands. But as we ""preserve, defend, and expand"" the peace that free peoples won in the 21st century, I believe we will see America vindicated in the eyes of the world, speedily in our time, in the 21st century.

That vindication will not come not only because of one man or one administration. It will come to America, to its true friends and allies, and to all of us -- including the scholars and students of the Elliott School, as we work together in partnership, the kind of partnership that your chairman and dean and your president has spoken about.

And friends, I would be remiss in this presentation if I did not close it with a personal note.

This university opened up a world for me, a new world. I first came here as an Infantry Lieutenant Colonel having spent, at that time, something like 12 years in uniform in solid infantry work. And I came to GW and found my horizon widened, my mind opened. I learned so much here that was so tremendously useful to me as I went on to different assignments.

I returned as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to receive an honorary degree from my alma mater. I learned more here than data processing and business technique. I learned about real management and genuine leadership. Most of all, as each and every one of the students here is learning now, I learned about my own potential. I discovered a part of myself I didn't know for sure was even there. And that's a lot to learn and I have an undying gratitude to the faculty of GW and to all who worked to make this institution so great.

I wish all of the students here the same opportunity for learning that I received here. I know that you will take advantage of the opportunity that is here.

I am so happy, so very happy to be here today to dedicate your new building, a building that will be serving noble purposes, the noble purposes for which it has been constructed. And I am so pleased to be a neighbor across the street. Now that you have put up the new building, now that you have shaped it, my young friends, may it shape you as you go from strength to strength. As you prepare yourself to become the new leaders of this great nation in the 21st century, GW will prepare you for that in an absolutely outstanding way. Of this, I am sure.

Thank you very much.

(Applause.)
